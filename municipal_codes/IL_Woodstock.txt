had an opportunity for a hearing under this article and for judicial review as provided: 1) the court
shall render judgment in favor of the city and against the defendant for the amount indicated in the

of a code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision, and
order of the hearing officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction.
In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment ordering a defendant to
correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a code violation, any
expenses incurred by the city to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney fees,
court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer, shall be a debt due and owing the city and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a hearing officer
pursuant to this subsection, the city shall provide notice to the defendant that states that the
defendant shall appear at a hearing before the administrative hearing officer to determine whether
the defendant has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a
hearing, which shall not be less than seven (7) days from the date that notice is served. If notice is
served by mail, the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on the date that the notice was
deposited in the mail.

uniform commercial code, a lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of
the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing the city under this section. The lien may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.
A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set a new hearing date, upon
a petition filed within twenty one (21) days after the issuance of the order of default, if the hearing
officer determines that the petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any
time if the petitioner establishes that the city did not provide proper service of process. If any
judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection, the hearing officer shall have authority to enter
an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the city as a
result of the vacated default judgment. (Ord. 15-O-58, 10-6-2015)
1.7L.14: SANCTIONS APPLICABLE TO THE OWNER AND PROPERTY:
The order to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the city as the result of a finding of
a code violation shall attach to the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of
a code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or transferring the property to
another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner of property takes ownership of the property
subject to the findings, decision and order of the hearing officer under this article. (Ord. 09-O-16, 3-3-

B. Each department head, individual or firm designated to review a proposed project shall, within
seven (7) days of the request for review, present the city council and property owner or developer
with a written estimate of time, materials, and costs involved. Such costs shall reflect specific areas
of review and standard hourly or per diem rates charged to the city. Where unusual circumstances
involve a number of unknown tasks, a cost ceiling and standard hourly or per diem rate may be set
to allow "work in progress" review and flexibility to cover costs incurred. All activities shall take
place after preliminary presentation of the proposed project before the plan commission and
sufficient copies of all pertinent documents, land use plan, plats and reports shall be made
available for each review, to the plan commission and city council to inform them of the status and
impact of each project. Copies of all reviews and reports shall be made available to the developer.
C. The person petitioning for rezoning and/or annexation or presenting subdivision, resubdivision, or
land use plan shall be notified that the services of the city's department heads, staff, or the
planning consultant, engineer, attorney, or other consultants are required. Such notification shall be
given to the petitioner prior to the preliminary presentation before the plan commission or other
commission, board or the corporate authority. Should additional review be required, subsequent
notice shall be given by the consultant or department head performing the review, to the petitioner
concerning the extent, content, and estimated cost of such review and report. (Ord. 1406, 10-18-

plan shall, hereafter, deposit with the city clerk, a sum of money as established from time to time
by the city council, as security for the reimbursement of review expenses. Where unusual
problems or conditions are encountered which require additional review, the corporate authority
shall notify the petitioner of such conditions. Should additional funds be required as a deposit, such
notification shall be given to the petitioner. (Ord. 1406, 10-18-1977; amd. 1986 Code)
E. Planning consultants, engineers, attorneys or other consultants to the city shall submit itemized bills

the city, shall be charged. The city shall be reimbursed for costs paid to its consultants from the
amount on deposit, as required in subsection D of this section. If the amount on deposit shall, for
any reason, be insufficient to fully reimburse the city for any costs and charges so paid, the
deficiency shall be billed to and collected from the owner or developer. Should city staff be involved
in designated review tasks, such services shall be reimbursed to the city in a similar manner,
determined by multiplying the number of hours spent on the review by the average hourly cost of
the city for salary, materials, overhead, fringe benefits and expenses.
F. Normal review procedures will require from thirty (30) to forty five (45) days depending upon
problems encountered. During the review period, the petitioner may request and shall receive a
statement on costs incurred for review activities to date. As services are completed, statements
shall be presented to the city so that compensation may be made following normal administrative
practices of the corporate authority.
G. Funds deposited with the city clerk which are not required to reimburse the planning consultant,
engineer, attorney or other designated consultant shall be returned to the petitioner; provided, that
all services requested have been completed and all bills have been paid in full. (Ord. 1406, 10-18-

of any new licenses shall be imposed to promote, permit and regulate the orderly growth of
liquor establishments in the City. (Ord. 15-O-25, 4-21-2015; amd. Ord. 18-O-34, 5-15-2018)

receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due
and owing.
A. No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4) years after the end of the
calendar year for which the return for the applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
B. If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period for which a notice of tax
determination or assessment may be issued by the city, the tax paid was less than seventy five
percent (75%) of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end

3.15.13: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of
an audit, investigation or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an
application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a
voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one
percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application, but not more than four (4)
years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the date the
application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax
due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax,
unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the
application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no
later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment
of tax and interest previously paid under this chapter must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final
determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 00-0-59, 12-19-2000)

Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or standard publishing
requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the city clerk's

Compiled Statutes 638/1 et seq. (the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act). For air to

the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in
Illinois where bills are sent.

processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for
purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the
service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the
taxable end to end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use
of intercompany facilities and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a
component of, or integrated into, end to end telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales
for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under the act. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling
arrangements" means that term as defined in 35 Illinois Compiled Statutes 120/2-27 (the retailers'
occupation tax act). (Ord. 02-0-70, 9-17-2002, eff. 1-1-2003; amd. Ord. 06-0-34, 5-16-2006)

telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the
act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the
taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax
enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly
due and paid in such other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.

place of business in this state and shall be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax
required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by
such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the
retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross
charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall constitute a
debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same
manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
B. Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct
item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 02-0-70, 9-17-2002,

implement the act. (Ord. 02-0-70, 9-17-2002, eff. 1-1-2003; amd. Ord. 06-0-34, 5-16-2006)
3.18.5: RESELLERS:
A. If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such
telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such
applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the
tax authorized by this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=562 221/525
B. Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and
shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is
obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication
tax free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
C. Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the grounds of being a sale for
resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that
number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 02-0-70, 9-17-2002, eff. 1-1-2003; amd. Ord.
06-0-34, 5-16-2006)

ineffective for any reason, or if this chapter is repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason, then
ordinance 2627 passed May 7, 1996, an ordinance amending this title implementing a
telecommunications tax within the city of Woodstock, McHenry County, Illinois, and ordinance 2707
passed November 4, 1997, an ordinance amending this code by imposing a municipal
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee shall be deemed in full force and effect as of the

County, the use of oak and hickory varieties and species native to McHenry County and the
surrounding region is encouraged. Emphasis should be placed on the planting of a mix of oak and
hickory varieties and native species, along with ornamental and flowering trees.
B. Trees planted close to detention or stormwater management facilities or to natural waterways and
water bodies, should be selected in part for their ability to tolerate hydric soils and conditions. They
should not, however, be located so as to interfere or conflict with public utilities, drainageways, or
the natural flow of water.

grows, at said owner's expense.
D. Consistent with good forestry practices, trees installed to replace dead or dying trees that have
been removed, should be of either an equivalent or superior quality of species. For example, a
softwood tree may be replaced with a hardwood tree, but an inferior species should not be
substituted for a superior species. (Ord. 11-O-67, 12-6-2011; amd. Ord. 17-O-81, 9-19-2017)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=562 290/525
by either the city or district. For purposes of determining guilt under this section, a person's
knowledge and intent are not elements of this offense.
B. False Security Alarm Conditions: For the purpose of this section, there shall be a rebuttable
presumption that a security system activation was a false alarm where the city determines that:
An activation of a user's security alarm system elicited a response by the police department, when
no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring an immediate response was
needed, this is to include a signal activated by negligence, accident, mechanical failure, and
electrical failure, signals activated intentionally in nonemergency situations, and signals for which
the actual cause of activation is unknown.
C. New Security Alarm Systems: Whenever a new security system is installed and added to the
network, no security system activation received from the subscriber's location shall be deemed a
false alarm for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of system acceptance by the city or
district so long as the total number of false alarms does not exceed a total of three (3). All false
security alarms exceeding three (3) in the first fifteen (15) days shall be charged at one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per activation. Following the fifteen (15) day grace period, false alarm fees will be
based on subsection E of this section.
D. Notice Of False Security Alarm: The method of notifying a subscriber of a false alarm shall be as
follows:
1. On a monthly basis, the city shall send a false security alarm notice to all subscriber's for whom
any false alarm(s), within the meaning of subsection A of this section, has been recorded. Such
notice shall include the date and time of each alarm, the suspected reason for the false alarm if
known, and the fee, if any, for the alarm(s). False alarm notices shall be sent to the responsible
party, as indicated on the registration form for the system, by postage paid, first class U.S. mail.
2. All false alarm fees shall be paid to the city within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.
3. Within twenty one (21) days of the false alarm invoice date, the owner of a security system may
provide evidence to rebut the presumption of a false security alarm to the wireless alarm board.
If it is found that the evidence provided successfully rebuts the false alarm determination of the
city, the false alarm charge for each false alarm successfully rebutted shall be deleted from the
security system's records. The decision of the wireless alarm board with regards to a false
security alarm classification shall be final.
E. False Security Alarm Fees: A response fee is hereby imposed on the responsible party of any
security alarm system to reimburse the city for the increased costs incurred in the response to
excessive false security alarms. False security alarms exceeding three (3) in a calendar year shall
be considered excessive.
The responsible party of any security system shall pay a false alarm response fee based on the
following schedule:

days after service of a violation notice, the penalty shall increase to two hundred dollars ($200.00).

A. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount set forth in this
section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the
permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article;
2. Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to
comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued
pursuant to this article; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs or expenses that the city
may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this
article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the
permittee is required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have completed
as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other
payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the form, at the permittee's
election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit
in a form acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this section
shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the city and the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the city of any amounts
covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state at which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably
estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee
fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will
be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction
of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase
will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or
phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=562 372/525
amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single
phase.
D. Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason
for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this section, may withdraw an amount from
the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within
the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city has been
compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the city determines can be remedied by an
expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the city that any
amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to
the amount specified in this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security
fund be returned to the permittee by the city, upon written request for said withdrawal to the city,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit,
the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains
on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable
law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable
costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts
in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to
all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no
action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right
the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be entitled to a double
monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

city as permitted by law.
B. Other Utilities; Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming that is done by any other utility with
facilities in the right of way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable state laws and
regulations specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation,
but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit
required under this article.
1. Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming permits shall include
assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
2. Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be
tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of
damages. The city will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees
removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or
unauthorized removal of trees. The City may require the removal and replacement of trees if
trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.
C. Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The City may require that special measures be
taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may
consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
C. Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Director of Public Works may authorize a variance only if
the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an
irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the
provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision
from which a variance is requested are not practical in relation to the requested approach.

exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per violation per day. There may be times when the City
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform
its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the City's costs of damages and
its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating or removing the facility that is the subject of
the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost
apportionment of the City. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs
apportioned to it. (Ord. 07-O-102, 12-4-2007)

A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not
cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry
standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given
written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and
resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675.
The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the
wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous
paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public
nuisance.
4. Utility Pole Restrictions: The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on City
utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the
communications space on the City utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise
unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of
the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker
safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National
Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

5. Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code
provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
6. Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with the following design standards and
any variations from these design standards may only be granted pursuant to the variance
provisions of section 6.1D.21 of this article:
a. Screening: Whenever any equipment or appurtenances are to be installed at grade, screening
must be installed to minimize the visibility of the facility and shall not be permitted to obstruct
sight lines or to create other traffic or safety problems.
b. Color And Stealth: All wireless facilities subject to this section, including all related equipment
and appurtenances, must be a color that blends with the surroundings of the pole, structure
tower or infrastructure on which it is mounted. The color must be comprised of nonreflective
materials which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures.
The applicant shall use good faith efforts to employ reasonable stealth techniques to conceal
the appearance of the wireless facilities. Any pole extension shall not be metallic or wood and
shall blend with the color of the pole upon which they are mounted.
c. Wiring And Cabling: Wires and cables connecting the antenna to the remainder of the facility
must be installed in accordance with the National Electrical Code and National Electrical
Safety Code adopted by the City and in force at the time of the installation of the facility. Any
wiring must be covered with an appropriate cover. No wiring and cabling serving the facility will
be allowed to interfere with any existing uses.
7. Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions
subsection, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna
systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a
small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure
within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined
by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the applicant shall provide written
certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate
location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
8. Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten
feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is

are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
a. Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting
only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the City, that
is located within three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
City, provided the City may designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet
(300') of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

b. Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
9. Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole
in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for
collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance as provided in section 6.1D.21 of this article.
10. Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that
are imposed by a contract between the City and a private property owner that concern design or
construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the
right-of-way.
11. Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: Subject to the variance provisions of this article (section
6.1D.21 of this article) and State law, the wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing
requirements of this article concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the
right-of-way.
12. Undergrounding Regulations: Subject to the variance provisions of this article (section 6.1D.21
of this article) and State law, the wireless provider shall comply with the provisions of this article
concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification
of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval.
13. Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed
within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the City and the
wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a
Municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the
issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the
permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the City grants an extension in writing to the
applicant.
L. Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
1. Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars ($650.00) for an application to
collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure,
and three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a
consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing utility poles
or wireless support structures.
2. Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for
such collocation.
3. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to
this section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be nonrefundable.
4. The City shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other
charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
a. Routine maintenance;
b. The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the
same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the City at least ten (10) days prior to the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=562 395/525
planned replacement and includes equipment type and model numbers for any of the
replacement equipment; or

suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with
applicable Safety Codes.
5. Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the City to work within rights-of-way for activities
that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures.
M. Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this section authorizes a person to collocate small wireless
facilities on:
1. Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the City or another unit of
local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or
wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner;
2. Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation
district for public park, recreation or conservation purposes without the consent of the affected
district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that
are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the
Illinois Highway Code; or
3. Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code,
Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in
section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter
rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this section do not apply to an electric or gas
public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed and
maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public
Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in section
3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any person
from any requirement: 1) to obtain a franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable
service or video service or 2) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this section.
N. Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the City and wireless providers that relate
to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small
wireless facilities on City utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all
small wireless facilities collocated on the City's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to
the City before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination provisions contained therein.
Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this section.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the City on the effective date of the Act
may accept the rates, fees and terms that the City makes available under this section for the
collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two (2) or more years after
the effective date of the Act by notifying the City that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms.
The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the City's utility poles pursuant to
applications submitted to the City before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises
its option under this paragraph.

wireless provider's use of space on the City utility pole.
If the City has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be two hundred
dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the
permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
P. Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12)
months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless
facility within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the City notifying the wireless
provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the City to the
owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not
removed within ninety (90) days of such notice, the City may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal utility poles or through
whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost
recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the City if it sells or transfers small wireless
facilities within the jurisdiction of the City. Such notice shall include the name and contact
information of the new wireless provider.
Q. Dispute Resolution: The Circuit Court of McHenry County, Illinois shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution
of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles
within the right-of-way, the City shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal utility pole, with rates
to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
R. Indemnification: A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the City harmless against any and all
liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or
in part, the use or occupancy of the City improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this section and the Act. A wireless provider has no obligation
to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the
sole negligence of the City or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special
damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability.
S. Insurance: The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense such
insurance as is required by this Code's provisions for the construction of utilities in the rights-ofway.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=562 397/525
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement
required by the City. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the selfinsurance,
to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this
subsection. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by
the City. (Ord. 18-O-43, 6-16-2018)

1480, 1-2-1979, eff. retroactive to 1-1-1979)
6.4D.7: WASTEWATER SERVICES, USER CHARGES:
A. Basis For Wastewater Service Charges: The wastewater service charge for the use of and for
service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and a surcharge if applicable.
The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding
bonds issued for sewerage/system improvements by the number of users. Through further
division, the monthly and quarterly debt service charges can be computed.
The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage
meters for wastes having the following concentrations:
1. A five (5) day, twenty degree Celsius (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of three
hundred forty milligrams per liter (340 mg/l).
2. A suspended solids (SS) content of four hundred milligrams per liter (400 mg/l).
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as
follows:
a. Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater
facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all works categories.
b. Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids
and BOD, if possible.
c. Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be treated.
d. Proportion the estimated costs to nonindustrial and industrial users by volume, suspended
solids and BOD.
e. Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage strength.
f. Compute surcharge costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons per mg/l in excess of normal
sewage strength for BOD and SS.
A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed a concentration for BOD three
hundred forty milligrams per liter (340 mg/l) and SS four hundred milligrams per liter (400
mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the three hundred forty milligrams per liter (340
mg/l) and four hundred milligrams per liter (400 mg/l) concentration for BOD and SS
respectively. The procedures to compute a surcharge are specified in subsection E of this
section.
The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public
accountants for the city in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be

delinquency charge. If the charges are not paid within thirty (30) days of their original due date, a
final notice of delinquency shall be sent, advising the customer that service shall be terminated if
the outstanding amount is not paid within fifteen (15) days. Notices should inform the recipients of
the delinquent amount of charges for the property and should indicate that a lien may be filed
against the property for remaining unpaid charges and associated City costs.
H. Liens:
1. Delinquent charges, including remaining balances of customers who default on deferred
payment plans, may constitute a lien upon the real estate upon or for which utility service is
supplied. If the final notice of delinquency has not been sent to the owner of record for any
reason, the City will send a final notice of delinquency to the owner of record before filing any
lien against the property.

remains unpaid, at the discretion of the Finance Director, the City may file a lien in the Office
of Recorder of Deeds in McHenry County for delinquent utility charges. This notice shall
describe: 1) the real property that is the subject of the lien sufficient for its identification, 2) the
amount of money due for utility service to that property, and 3) the date when such amount
became delinquent.

suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose on any lien recorded pursuant to this
section. The City shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees in any action to
foreclose a lien recorded pursuant to this section.

user of the real estate in a civil action to recover the money due for services rendered, plus a
reasonable attorney fee, to be fixed by the court.
J. Posting Of Service Termination:
1. In the event the bill remains unpaid fifteen (15) days following the final notice of delinquency, the
City may terminate the water service. If the City elects to do so, then a "notice of water shutoff"
shall be served through hand delivery to the occupant or by posting on the real estate for which
the outstanding obligation is owed. The notice shall state that the utility service will be terminated
if the bill is not paid within twenty four (24) hours and, if utility service is disconnected, the
building may be red tagged by the City as "unfit for human occupancy".
2. Within twenty four (24) hours after being red tagged, all persons and animals are to vacate the
building until utility service is reinstated.

such repairs shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
L. Reinstatement Of Service:

fee and, when applicable, a twenty five dollar ($25.00) posting fee, the City will reinstate the
utility service.

City is concerned, be again "fit for human occupancy" in this regard only.
4. Should a City employee be sent to a property to turn off the water after proper notices and the
water is left on because a payment arrangement is made at this point, a twenty five dollar
($25.00) dispatch fee will be charged. This fee will be in addition to the twenty five dollar
($25.00) posting fee, if applicable, but will be in lieu of the fifty dollar ($50.00) reinstatement fee.
5. Termination of service for any reason including nonpayment will not eliminate customer
obligation from being charged any applicable utility rates under this chapter.
M. Deposit: At the discretion of the Finance Director, delinquent customers may be required to place
on deposit with the City an amount equal to the estimated user charges for three (3) billing periods.
The user shall continue to pay the charges assessed hereunder by the City thereafter as billed,
and after eight (8) billing periods of prompt payment of such charges with no delinquency in excess
of thirty (30) days, the deposit shall be refunded to the person having made such deposit.

Refunds will be processed within thirty (30) days of such event.
All refunds of deposits will not include interest.

final bill related to charges for water, sewer, and garbage service to the property to be paid at the
time of closing or before. In the event that property is acquired without payment made for water,

improvement as defined in section 7.8.1 of this chapter, the applicant shall first file an application
for project review with the community development department ("department" for purposes of this
chapter). (Ord. 01-O-41, 11-6-2001)
B. Project review applications shall include those materials required by the plan commission
("commission" for purposes of this chapter) and the department. (Ord. 01-O-41, 11-6-2001; amd.
Ord. 12-O-21, 3-20-2012)
C. Upon receipt of the required filings, the department shall review the application and plans for
compliance with the commission's standards and other city ordinances. The department shall
provide the applicant with a written report of its review no more than ten (10) business days after a
completed application has been filed. The written report shall include any problems or deficiencies.
The applicant may revise the application and resubmit it to the department or file for an appeal
pursuant to section 2.12.9 of this code.
D. Project review approval for an individual building site shall be revoked in the event the applicant
has not applied for a building permit for the construction of the proposed structure within one year
from the date of the approval of the project.
E. Project review approval for a planned development shall be valid as long as the preliminary and
final plats of planned development are valid.
F. Prior to approval of the project review application, the applicant may submit a building permit
application to the building and zoning officer. However, the building and zoning officer shall not
issue a building permit until written project plan approval has been received from the department
and the applicant has established an escrow or letter of credit with the city pursuant to section
7.8.4 of this chapter. (Ord. 01-O-41, 11-6-2001)
7.8.4: COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
A. Prior to the issuance of any building permit, and subsequent to either project review or city council
action, the applicant for a building permit shall deposit with the building inspector an itemized
estimate of the cost of the installation of all site improvements, including, but not limited to,
landscaping, plantings, lighting, driveways, off street parking and loading facilities, sidewalks,
parkways and interior streets. In addition to the estimate of the costs of improvement, the applicant
shall also deposit an escrow deposit or letter of credit in a sum equal to one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the total improvement costs. Escrow accounts shall be created in an institution
designated by the city manager and shall be governed by the terms and provisions in accordance
with escrow agreements, forms of which are available in the city offices and subject to the approval
of the city manager and the city attorney. (Ord. 1470, 11-7-1978; amd. Ord. 01-0-41, 11-6-2001)
B. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all site improvements have been completed;
provided, however, that delays due to circumstances beyond the control of the builder, developer
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=562 522/525
or applicant may be recognized as a condition for the issuance of a temporary certificate of
occupancy, provided the buildings are otherwise complete. A temporary certificate of occupancy
shall not exceed six (6) months and is not renewable. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued in such circumstances when an escrow deposit or letter of credit has been deposited
equaling one hundred ten percent (110%) of the cost of any unfinished improvements as
determined by the city's development engineer.
C. All escrow deposits and letters of credit shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the
applicant and/or builder to complete all the improvements specified in the project plan. If, in the
judgment of the development engineer the completion of the improvement is being or has been
unreasonably delayed, the development engineer shall serve notice upon the builder or applicant
at his last known address. If, within thirty (30) days after the date of service of notice, the builder or
applicant has not completed the improvements, the development engineer shall cause the
completion of the improvements specified in the project plan, paying for such improvements out of
the balance of the escrow deposit or letter of credit.
D. Prior to the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy for any improvement, the building owner or
applicant shall file with his application for a final certificate of occupancy, a surety bond in an
amount equal to five percent (5%) of the total cost of the improvements as originally provided in
the cost estimate. The surety bond shall be conditioned upon the workmanlike installation of the
project plan improvements, and shall guarantee the work of the builder for a period of one year.
Evidence of the use of faulty material, negligence in construction or unworkmanlike performance, if
determined by the development engineer, shall cause forfeiture of the bond. The development
engineer shall then cause the repair and/or replacement of any faulty construction using the
proceeds of such bond to defray the cost of such repair or replacement. The remainder of any
bond forfeited for the repair or replacement of the improvements shall be returned to the builder.
Upon issuance of the final certificate of occupancy and the filing of the required surety bond with
the city, all previous escrow accounts shall terminate and any balance returned to the applicant or
builder.
E. Any decision, ruling or regulation of the development engineer may be appealed to the city council.
The city council may sustain or overrule the development engineer's decision, ruling or regulation.
(Ord. 01-0-41, 11-6-2001)
7.8.5: PENALTY:
Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this chapter shall be fined not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense, plus
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the city. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each
day during or on which such violation occurs or continues. (Ord. 01-0-41, 11-6-2001)

1.9 Consistency with Comprehensive Plan
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 1.4
This Ordinance is intended to support and implement the City of Woodstock’s planning goals,
objectives, and policies, as set forth in the City’s comprehensive planning documents, including
those listed in Section 1.14 of this Chapter. Any amendments to, or actions pursuant to the
Ordinance, shall be consistent with applicable planning documents and policies adopted by the
City. While the City Council reaffirms its commitment that this Ordinance and any amendment
to it should be in conformity with adopted planning policies, the City Council hereby expresses
its intent that neither this Ordinance nor any amendments to it may be challenged solely on the
basis of any alleged non-conformity with any planning document.
When an application for planned unit development, subdivision, or special use permit approval is
requested for land or any portion of land depicted as or abutting “resource conservation” or
“resource conservation corridor” in the City’s comprehensive planning documents, or for land
that is characterized by sensitive natural resources, compliance with the conservation design
standards set forth in Chapter 8B of this Ordinance is required unless waived by the Plan
Commission.
Commentary:
“Conservation design” is a design system that takes into account the natural landscape and
ecology of a development site and facilitates development while maintaining the most
valuable natural features and functions of the site. Conservation design includes a collection
of site design principles and practices that can be combined to create environmentally sound
development. The main principles for conservation design are:
1. flexibility in site design and lot size,
2. thoughtful protection and management of natural resources,
3. reduction of impervious surface areas, and
4. sustainable stormwater management.
… Conservation design is density neutral, meaning that designers plan development such
that there is no overall loss of buildable units despite the conservation goals achieved on the
site.

D. Stop Work Orders. Whenever any building or structure or part thereof is
demolished, constructed, reconstructed, altered or repaired in a hazardous manner, in
substantial violation of any provisions of this Ordinance, or in a manner that endangers
life or property, the Community Development Director has the authority to issue a stop

conditions which must be met in order for the work to resume.
3. Notice of the stop work order shall be served on the person doing the work or
conducting the violation activity by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail,
and shall be posted on the site. Said notice may also be served by registered mail or
certified mail to the property owner or contractor if they are responsible for the work
being done.

work order may be posted on the property and shall be effective immediately and as if
sent by registered mail or certified mail.

described in the stop work order shall immediately cease.

3.5 Enforcement Procedures
A. Notice of Violation Procedure. The following notice of violation procedure shall be
used to enforce this Ordinance.
1. Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that a person is violating the
provisions of this Ordinance or any plan, order, or condition which has been imposed
pursuant to this Ordinance, the Community Development Director shall notify that person
of the violation. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be served by personnel delivery
or mailed by first class United States mail. Where a violation recurs and is repetitive in
nature, the original notice shall be considered sufficient and multiple subsequent notices
are not required. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
2. The notice of violation shall describe the violation, shall identify the provision of
this Ordinance that is being violated, shall specify what actions must be taken to correct
the violation, shall direct the person to correct the violation within a specified and
reasonable time period beginning on the date the notice is received, and shall indicate that
more severe measures may be brought against the person if the violation is not corrected.
If the violator can not be determined, then the notice of violation shall be sent to the
record owner of the land on which the violation occurs.
3. Upon receipt of a request for additional time to correct the violation, the
Community Development Director may authorize additional time to achieve compliance.
Such time extension may not exceed thirty (30) days unless the violator can demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director that (a) substantial progress
is being made in regard to corrective measures, or that (b) the violation can not be
corrected within the specified time period because labor and/or materials necessary to
correct the violation are unavailable due to circumstances beyond the control of the
violator or property owner.
4. If the violation is corrected within the time period set forth in the notice of
violation, or within the extended period granted by the Community Development
Director, then no further action against the violator or property owner shall be taken.
5. No penalty shall be assessed pursuant to this Ordinance unless and until the
person in violation has been notified of the violation in accordance with the provisions of
this Section, with the exception of a violation of a stop work order or the illegal
placement of a temporary sign. In the case of a violation of a stop work order, the
violator shall be subject to the immediate imposition of a penalty. In the case of an
illegal temporary sign, the City shall be authorized to remove such sign immediately.
B. Citation Procedure.
1. If a violation has not been corrected after a notice of violation is issued or of the
violation recurs, the Community Development Director may serve a written citation on
the alleged violator by any of the methods specified herein. If the violator can not be
ascertained, then the citation may be sent to the record owner of the land on which the
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 3.5
violation occurs. The citation shall describe the nature of the violation, what actions
must be taken to correct said violation, and the amount of the fine that must be paid. The
fine must be paid within five (5) business days of receipt of the citation or no more then
five (5) days of the date specified on the citation. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted
October 20, 2009).
2. Any person given a notice of violation pursuant to this Ordinance, who does not
comply with this Ordinance within the time period set forth in said notice and who
continues such violation or who violates a stop work order, shall be subject to the
penalties and remedies set forth in this Ordinance and in the City of Woodstock City
Code. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
C. Removal of Dangerous Signs or Structures. In the case of a sign or sign structure
that the Community Development Director reasonably determines is in danger of falling
or otherwise creating an immediate safety hazard, the Community Development Director
is hereby authorized to immediately remove such sign or sign structure, at the expense of
the property owner.
3.6 Persons Subject to Penalties
The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect,
builder, contractor, or agent, or other person, who commits, participates in, assists in, or
maintains a violation of the provisions of this Ordinance may be found guilty of a separate
offense and be subject to the penalties established herein.

the right to ask questions of or reply to any party testifying in order to clarify an issue,
statement, or fact.

costs for such services shall be at the petitioner’s expense and the proceedings shall not
move forward until said costs are paid. Such consultants or experts shall have the same
standing to testify and to be cross-examined as any other witnesses at the hearing.
8. After the hearing body has passed a motion to close the public comment portion
of the hearing, members of the hearing body may begin their deliberations in order to
take action. The hearing body may begin its deliberations prior to the close of the

applicable to the Zoning Board of Appeals, including public hearing notice requirements, as set
forth in Section 4.5 herein shall apply to and be used by the Plan Commission when such a
variation is considered.
4.3.7 Zoning Map Amendment Approval Criteria
Zoning map amendments or rezonings may be approved based on the following criteria. In some
instances all of the criteria may not be relevant or applicable, and none of the individual criteria
by itself has more standing than the others.
A. The zoning map amendment or rezoning corrects an error or responds to a changing
condition in the area;
B. The zoning map amendment or rezoning will allow land uses that are compatible with
existing uses and zoning of nearby property;
C. Adequate public facilities and services can be provided to the subject property. The
subject property is suitable for the uses allowed if the zoning map amendment or
rezoning is approved and possesses physical attributes which allows it to be used in
accordance with the proposed zoning designation;
D. The zoning map amendment or rezoning will not result in significant adverse impacts on
other land in the vicinity of the subject property or on the environment, including air,
water, noise, stormwater management, and natural resources;
E. The zoning map amendment or rezoning will not result in a lessening of area property
values or the ability of area properties to be used in accordance with the underlying
zoning designation. If property values are lessened as a result of the proposed
amendment, there should be a benefit to the public which justifies or supercedes such loss
of value;
F. The public or community benefit derived from the uses allowed within the proposed
zoning district.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.12
Commentary: Legal Standards for Reviewing a Rezoning Petition
In LaSalle National Bank of Chicago v. County of Cook, 12 Ill2d 40, 145 N.E. 2d 65 the Illinois
Supreme Court established six factors to be considered when reviewing a zoning request.
Subsequently, in the case of Sinclair Pipeline Company v. Village of Richton Park 19 Ill. 2d 370, 167
N.E.2d 406 the Supreme Court added two other factors. The factors in these cases constitute the legal
basis for the review of zoning decisions by a local government and are summarized below.
1. The existing uses and zoning of nearby property. Are the adjoining property uses consistent
with the proposed use? Are there any conflicts between the proposed zoning district and the uses
allowed therein and the uses either allowed or existing on nearby properties? Moreover, what is
meant by the term “nearby”? Zoning has to begin and end somewhere, and just because a use
exists on one side of a street does not mean it must extend across it. Often streets are used as
zoning demarcation lines.
2. The extent to which property values are diminished by particular zoning restrictions. An
increase in property value because of a change in allowable uses by itself is not a basis for
rezoning. Rather, it is only one factor to be considered and must be weighed against any real or
potential detriment to the public welfare resulting from the zoning change.
3. The extent to which the destruction of property values of the applicant promotes the health,
safety, morals or general welfare of the public. This is both a fact question and also a policy
question as it relates to the proposed use.
4. The relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual
property owner. For example, in considering a proposed commercial rezoning next to a
residential area, one consideration would be the impact on the residences as compared to the
benefit to the entire community of having a commercial development in the proposed location.
5. The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes. Under this consideration
topography, soils, parcel size and location, and other physical characteristics of the parcel to be
rezoned are examined to see if the zoning is appropriate.
6. The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land
development in the immediate area and the general vicinity of the subject property. This
criterion is more relevant to in-fill properties than to outlying vacant lands proposed to be annexed
to the City. In the former the length of time the property is vacant may suggest that current zoning
is inappropriate and that rezoning is appropriate. In the latter case unannexed land that has been
vacant does not in and of itself necessarily suggest rezoning is appropriate.
7. The community need for the proposed use. One weighs the need in the community for the
proposed zoning change. For example, the City may consider whether sufficient commercial
zoning already exists or whether a rezoning is appropriate due to a scarcity of multiple-family
zoning.
8. The care in which the community has undertaken to plan its land use development. Here
the courts look at a City’s comprehensive planning documents to determine if previous proposals
have been made to the plan regarding the land being rezoned. If zoning is challenged, it is helpful
if the City has a record with regard to existing zoning being consistent with its comprehensive plan.
If the plan suggests the rezoning of the property, it is difficult to defend against it. Also, past
comprehensive planning efforts in the municipality may indicate the weight to be accorded the
City’s decision.
4.4 Special Use Permits
4.4.1 Application Filing
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.13
An application for a special use permit, verified by the owner or authorized agent of the owner of
property involved, shall be filed in the Community Development Department upon a form
provided by the Department and shall contain or be accompanied by all required information.
Detailed plans, drawings, and other information as specified by this Ordinance shall be required
for the various meetings and hearings at such time as prescribed by the Community Development
Director. Special use permit applications may be filed and processed concurrently with other
development applications.
4.4.2 Content Requirements
The application for a special use permit shall include but is not limited to the following items
which shall be provided prior to the public hearing:
A. The name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the subject property and, if
applicable, the name and address of the owner’s authorized representative.
B. A description of the general location of the subject property, its present zoning status, its

be submitted which depicts how the subject property is intended to be developed.
D. A Natural Resources Information (NRI) Report prepared by the McHenry County Soil
and Water Conservation District or correspondence from said District indicating that an
NRI Report is not necessary. If the subject property is already developed an NRI Report
may not be required.
E. An Endangered Species Consultation Program Agency Action Report from the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources. If subject property is already developed or part of an
existing development, an Endangered Species Consultation Program Agency Action
Report may not be required.
F. A “consent to on-site inspection” form signed by the applicant or owner.

Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.14
McHenry County Recorder of Deeds; or (2) the person(s) who last paid property taxes as
reflected in the tax records of the McHenry County Treasurer.. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64,
adopted October 20, 2009).
4.4.4 Plan Commission Review and Action. The Plan Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the special use permit application and make a recommendation to the City Council,
based on the special use permit approval criteria set forth herein. Such a recommendation shall
be made within thirty (30) days following the date on which the required public hearing is
concluded and closed. This time frame may be extended to a specific date at the request of the
Plan Commission subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension. The Plan Commission may
recommend approval, denial, or approval with conditions of the requested special use permit. If a
recommendation can not be made, the special use permit application shall be forwarded to the
City Council for final consideration.
4.4.5 City Council Review and Action
After receiving required recommendations, the City Council shall review the application and
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed special use permit. The City Council’s
action shall occur within thirty (30) days following the date on which the application is placed on
a City Council meeting agenda and consideration of the application commences. This time frame
may be extended to a specific date at the request of the City Council subject to the petitioner
agreeing to such extension.
4.4.6 Special Use Permits and Variations

consider said request and conduct a public hearing on the special use petition and the variation.
After the conclusion of such a hearing, the Plan Commission shall present its recommendation
regarding the combined special use permit petition and the variation to the City Council. Such a
recommendation shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date on which the required
public hearing is concluded and closed. This time frame may be extended to a specific date at the
request of the Plan Commission subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension. In such
instances the Plan Commission shall serve in lieu of and with the same power and authority of the
Zoning Board of Appeals. Procedures and criteria applicable to the Zoning Board of Appeals,
including public hearing notice requirements, as set forth in Section 4.5 herein shall apply to and
be used by the Plan Commission when such a variation is considered. If a recommendation can
not be made, the combined special use permit and variation application shall be forwarded to the
City Council for final consideration.
4.4.7 Special Use Permit Approval Criteria
Special use permit applications may be approved after a finding that the following approval
criteria have been addressed.
A. That the special use will not impair or be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals
or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity.
B. That the special use will not negatively impact or conflict with neighboring land uses or
negatively affect the value of neighboring property.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.15
C. That the special use will not conflict with the general goals and objectives of
Woodstock’s comprehensive planning documents.
D. That the special use will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in a manner
that is compatible with the existing or desired character of the surrounding area.
E. That additional traffic which may occur as a result of the special use will not be
detrimental to public safety and welfare.
F. That the special use can be served by public facilities and services, and by private
utilities.
G. That the special use will comply with applicable City ordinances unless varied or waived
by the City Council as part of the special use permit approval process.
4.4.8 Findings of Fact
All recommendations from the Plan Commission regarding special use permit applications shall
be supported by findings of fact specifying the reasons and justification for the decision.
4.4.9 Lapse of Approval
Unless otherwise expressly stated in the approved special use permit, if an approved special use
activity has not been established within two (2) years of the date of approval by the City Council
or if the special use ceases to be maintained for a period of more than 1 year, the special use
permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. For purposes of this section, the term “established”
shall mean the issuance of a building or construction permit or certificate of occupancy for the
special use. For phased development, the term “established” shall mean the issuance of a
building or construction permit for the first phase of development. The time-frames stated herein
may be extended for up to one year by the Community Development Director if a written
extension request is filed with the City prior to the expiration of the special use permit. Any
additional extensions may be granted by the City Council only upon written request of the
applicant.
4.4.10 Amendments to an Approved Special Use Permit
Any proposed change, amendment, or alteration of an approved special use permit, except for
those needed to comply with the City’s engineering standards or building code requirements, or
those due to a reduction in density, floor area, or impervious surfaces, may be approved only
pursuant to the standards and procedures established for issuance of a special use permit.
4.5 Zoning Variations
Variations requested as part of a planned unit development petition, traditional neighborhood
development petition, or special use permit petition may be approved as part of the review and
approval process for those petitions. The term “variation,” as used in this Section, does not
include and is not applicable to zoning map amendments or zoning text amendments. A variation
which authorizes the establishment of a land use that is not otherwise allowed in the underlying
zoning district is not permitted.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.16
Commentary: Use Variations
Variations can be requested from virtually any of the provisions set forth in the City’s zoning
regulations. However, an exception to this is when a variation is requested that would allow a use, not
otherwise allowed in the underlying or surrounding zoning district, to be established on a property. By
approving such a use, the City Council would be authorizing an alteration of such magnitude that it
would effectively be changing the zoning of the property. When a use is contemplated that is not
allowed in the underlying zoning district, the applicant may wish to consider applying for a zoning map
amendment or for a change in the zoning status of the subject property.
4.5.1 Application Filing
An application for a zoning variation, verified by the owner or authorized agent of the owner of
the property involved, shall be filed in the Department of Community Development on a form
provided by said Department, which shall contain or be accompanied by all required information.
Detailed plans, drawings, and other information as specified herein shall be required for the
various meetings and hearings at such time as prescribed by the Director of Community
Development. Applications for a zoning variation may be filed and processed concurrently with
other development applications.
4.5.2 Content Requirements
Application for a zoning variation shall include but is not limited to the following:
A. Name, address, and telephone number of applicant and of property owner.
B. General location and legal description of the property for which the zoning variation is
requested. A survey of the property may be required depending upon the type of
variation being requested.
C. The specific zoning variation requested with reference to the specific section of this
Ordinance being varied.
D. Detailed explanation as to why the zoning variation is being requested, with specific
reference to the variation criteria set forth herein.
4.5.3 Public Hearing Notice
Upon receipt of the required zoning variation application and a determination that it is complete,
the Community Development Director shall authorize the scheduling of a required public hearing
before the Zoning Board of Appeals. Neighbor and newspaper notices shall be provided for all
public hearings in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter. Owners of all property
abutting or across the road, street, or alley from the subject property shall be notified. The
petitioner shall deliver in person or mail notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to
either (1) the owner(s), as recorded in the office of the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds;
or (2) the person(s) who last paid property taxes as reflected in the tax records of the McHenry
County Treasurer. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.17
4.5.4 Administrative Review and Action
A request to modify by twenty (20) percent or less any numeric standard set forth in Table 7A.2
or in Sections 7A.3, 9.8, 9.12, or 9.17 of this Ordinance, except standards pertaining to required
lot area, may be reviewed and approved by the Community Development Director as an
administrative variation, in which case a public hearing is not required. Before such variation
may be granted, a notice of the intent to grant such variation shall be sent by certified mail to the
record owners of property abutting or across the road, street, or alley from the subject property. If
any such owner files a written objection with the Community Development Director within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice, the variation must then be presented to the Zoning
Board of Appeals and City Council in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. The
approval of an administrative variation shall be based on the “standards for zoning variations” set
forth herein.
4.5.5 Zoning Board of Appeals Review and Action
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on a zoning variation application and
make a recommendation to the City Council, based on the variation approval criteria set forth
herein. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall submit its recommendation to the City Council within
30 days following the date on which the public hearing for a zoning variation is closed and
concluded. The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend approval, denial, approval of a lesser
variation, or approval with conditions of the requested zoning variation. Such a recommendation
shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date on which the required public hearing is
concluded and closed. This time frame may be extended to a specific date at the request of the
Zoning Board of Appeals subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension.
4.5.6 City Council Review and Action
After receiving required recommendations, the City Council shall review the application and
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed zoning variation based on the variation
approval criteria set forth herein. The City Council’s action shall occur within thirty (30) days
following the date on which the application is placed on a City Council meeting agenda and
consideration of the application commences. This time frame may be extended to a specific date
at the request of the City Council subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension.
4.5.7 Standards for Zoning Variations
Zoning variations may be approved after a finding that the following approval criteria have been
addressed.
A. The extent to which particular physical surroundings, shape, or topography of the subject
property results in practical difficulty or hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a
mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the zoning regulations are carried out.
B. The extent that the alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the application of these
zoning regulations and has not been created by any person having an interest in the
property.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.18
C. The extent to which conditions upon which the zoning variation request is based are
unique to the subject property and would not be applicable to other property within the
same zoning classification.
D. Whether the variation is based exclusively on a desire to increase the value of the
property, the monetary gain to be realized from the property, or the ability to alleviate
financial difficulty experienced by the petitioner when attempting to comply with the
City’s zoning regulations.
E. The detrimental impact, if any, to the public welfare, to other property, or to
improvements in the immediate neighborhood which may result if the zoning variation is
granted.
F. Whether or not the proposed zoning variation will impair the adequate supply of light and
air to adjacent property, or substantially increase congestion in public streets, or endanger
the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values in the neighborhood;
and
G. That the zoning variation will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is
denied by these regulations to other lands, structures or buildings of the same zoning
classification.
4.5.8 Lapse of Approval
Unless otherwise expressly stated when a zoning variation is approved, if the activity for which
said variation is granted does not commence within two (2) years of the approval date, said
approval shall lapse and be of no further effect. For purposes of this section, the term
“established” shall mean the issuance of a building or construction permit or certificate of
occupancy for the variation. The time-frame stated herein may be extended for up to one (1) year
by the Community Development Director if an extension request is filed with the City prior to the
expiration of the variation. Any additional extensions of approval may be granted by the City
Council upon written request of the applicant.
4.6 Interpretations and Appeals of Administrative Decisions
4.6.1 Interpretations
A. The Community Development Director is authorized to interpret the zoning map and the
text of the City’s zoning regulations, and to make determinations regarding disputed
zoning district boundary lines and similar questions. An applicant for interpretation may
appeal the decision of the Community Development Director in the manner set forth
herein.
B. An application for interpretation of the zoning map or text of the City’s zoning
regulations shall be submitted to the Community Development Director and shall include
sufficient information to enable an interpretation to be made.
C. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts, Section 7A.1.1.B shall apply.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 4.19
4.6.2 Appeals
A. An appeal of any order or decision of the Community Development Director regarding
the zoning regulations of the City may be presented for consideration to the Zoning
Board of Appeals by the aggrieved individual or party. Any such appeal shall be
submitted in writing and must include the basis for such appeal. A notice of appeal shall
be considered filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals when delivered to the Department
of Community Development and the date of filing shall be entered on the notice of
appeal.
B. An appeal to any such order or decision must be filed with the Community Development
Director within thirty (30) days after the date on which the order or decision is made.
The Community Development Director shall schedule a meeting of the Zoning Board of
Appeals within 45 days and transmit to the Board all applicable materials comprising the
record relating to the order or decision being appealed.
C. The filing of an appeal stays all action by the City seeking enforcement of or compliance
with the order or decision being appealed, unless the Community Development Director
determines that, in his opinion, such a stay would create a public safety hazard or cause
immediate peril to life or property.
D. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm (wholly or in part) or may modify
the order or decision being appealed. Such a recommendation shall be made within thirty
(30) days following the date on which the Zoning Board of Appeals’ consideration is
concluded. This time frame may be extended to a specific date at the request of the
Zoning Board of Appeals subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension.
E. The action of the Zoning Board of Appeals may be appealed to the City Council by the
aggrieved individual or party or by the Community Development Director. Such an
appeal must be filed with the City Manager within thirty (30) days after the date of the
Zoning Board of Appeal’s action. The City Council’s action shall occur within thirty
(30) days following the date on which the application is placed on a City Council meeting
agenda and consideration of the application commences. This time frame may be
extended to a specific date at the request of the City Council subject to the petitioner
agreeing to such extension.
4.7 Annexations
Refer to Chapter 12 herein, entitled “Annexations and Disconnections”.
4.8 Certificates of Occupancy
No land or building shall be occupied or used in whole or in part for any use until a Certificate of
Occupancy has been issued by the Community Development Director, indicating that the building
or use complies with all requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable City ordinances and
regulations. Upon completion of any building or structure in accordance with applicable building
permit requirements and prior to occupancy, a Certificate of Occupancy is required for the use
originally designated. A Certificate of Occupancy is not required where there is a change in
occupancy or a change in ownership, but not a change in use.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
5.1 Purpose
5.2 Planned Unit Development
5.3 Reserved
5.4 Approval Process and Application
5.5 Relationship of PUD to Zoning Map and this Ordinance
5.6 PUDs and Zoning Changes
5.7 Permitted Uses
5.8 PUD Design Standards
5.9 Open Space Requirements for Cluster Development
5.10 PUD Approval Prior to this Ordinance
5.1 Purpose
The City’s zoning regulations are based on the division of the City into districts in which the use
of land and buildings, as well as the bulk and location of buildings and structures, in relation to the
land are substantially uniform. There are, however, unique and innovative uses which because of
their characteristics or because of underlying physical conditions of a site, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district without consideration of such uses on neighboring land and the
desirability of such uses at a particular location. Furthermore, while conventional zoning districts
and the requirements of those districts are reasonable, there may be circumstances or projects
where it is in the interest of the community to allow unique and/or creative development designs
and techniques.
It is recognized that the City Council may approve a planned unit development (PUD) to facilitate
the use of flexible techniques of land development and site design, by providing relief from zoning
and platting requirements designed for conventional developments. These PUD regulations are
not intended to allow excessive densities or the development of incompatible land uses, either
within the development or in relation to the surrounding neighborhood. By choosing to petition
for PUD approval, a person elects to submit a development proposal to the Plan Commission and
City Council for discretionary review.
5.2 Planned Unit Development
A PUD is a tract or parcel of land, the use and development of which is approved and authorized
by City Council ordinance, containing two or more principal buildings or which is more than two
acres in size, and which is developed as a unit under single ownership or unified control. Any
condominium project or any townhome or townhouse project, whether proposed in one or more
buildings, or any residential subdivision, shall be a PUD. A PUD may contain a mixture of
principal uses and dwelling types and is designed specifically for the conditions on the site and to
achieve a unified overall development. A PUD may not be required to completely conform to all
of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
5.3 Reserved
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 5.2
5.4 Approval Process and Application
Requests for PUD approval shall comply with and be processed in accordance with the
subdivision and platting regulations set forth in Chapter 6A, 6B, and 6C of this Ordinance.
5.5 Relationship of PUD to Zoning Map and this Ordinance
A. The PUD designation is intended to be attached to existing zoning districts as a special
use.
B. The development of a PUD shall not occur until approved in accordance with this
Ordinance.
C. As part of the PUD approval process, variances and waivers of requirements otherwise set
forth in this Ordinance may be granted without proceeding through a separate variation or
waiver process.
5.6 PUDs and Zoning Changes. A special use permit and any zoning change approved for a
PUD shall not become effective until the approved PUD is recorded with the McHenry County
Recorder.
5.7 Permitted Uses
Because a PUD is a means of achieving greater development flexibility in a way that may not
always be possible under conventional zoning restrictions, it may depart from strict conformity
with the density, use, design, dimension, area, height, bulk, and other regulations set forth in this
Ordinance, as long as said departures are depicted and included as part of the approved PUD
documents. The uses permitted in a PUD shall be governed by the permitted uses in the
underlying zoning district and the uses approved as part of the PUD.
5.8 PUD Design Standards
5.8.1 General Standards
The following standards shall apply to a PUD:
A. The proposed development at the subject location shall be consistent with the planning
policies and goals of the City.
B. The proposed development at its location shall comply with the intent and standards of
these regulations.
C. The proposed development at the subject location shall not result in a substantial adverse
effect on any of the following, either as they exist at the time of application or as they may
exist in the future: (1) adjacent property, (2) natural resources, (3) infrastructure, (4)
public sites, or (5) other matters affecting the public health safety, or general welfare.
D. The approved number of dwelling units or occupancy units shall not exceed the number of
dwelling units permitted by the regulations of the underlying zoning district, except as
provided for in this Ordinance.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 5.3
F. If any open space, common areas, or recreational facilities in the PUD are intended to be
used solely for the residents of the project, adequate provisions shall be made so that such
areas and facilities are properly improved, maintained, operated, and owned.
5.8.2 Design Standards
In addition to standards set forth in this Ordinance for specific uses and development proposals,
the following design standards shall be used to evaluate proposed PUD projects. Compliance with
all of the standards is not mandatory and no single standard is more important then another.
• Buildings have massing compatible with the scale and intensity of surrounding
development
• Higher density or intensity development abutting lower density or intensity areas
includes transitional buffering and substantially mitigate any negative impacts.
• Lot layout promotes cluster design, conservation design, and/or traditional neighborhood
design elements.
• Pedestrian and/or bicycle access in the form of public sidewalks and/or private trails and
pathways is addressed.
• Pedestrian and/or bicycle access is provided within the boundary of the PUD to schools,
parks, and similar amenities.
• Off street parking is adequate to serve the needs of proposed land uses. The amount of
required parking may be varied if proposed uses warrant such a variation.
• Multifamily developments include open space or recreational facilities.
• Sidewalks and related pedestrian facilities are incorporated within neighborhoods.
• Conservation organizations and similar entities, or an owners association when such
entities are not available, maintain private landscaping amenities, on-site signage, open
space, and recreational facilities and pathways.
• School sites and park sites abut or are located in proximity to each other.
• Public facilities comprised all or partly of buildings and structures include buffering and
substantially mitigate negative impacts.
• A minimum of 35 percent of the overall site area is set aside as dedicated open space.
• Bicycle lanes and/or routes are addressed for appropriate collectors and arterial streets
• Pedestrian and/or bicycle trails, including picnic and rest areas, are provided as
appropriate.
• Handicapped accessible facilities are provided.
• Recreation and open space facilities are linked to the open space network and amenities.
• Storm water management facilities, such as retention or detention ponds, are constructed
using native landscaping to provide water quality benefits and infiltration, and
complement natural amenities on the project site.
• Stormwater management facilities and open space areas shall follow the performance
standards specified in Appendix JA.
• Site design features and amenities are designed to be protective of groundwater integrity
and to minimize negative impacts on groundwater resources.
• Conservation design elements are incorporated into overall site design.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 5.4
• No two residential structures with the same front facade are located on the same side of a
street within three (3) building lots or sites of each other. Facade reversal may be
considered dissimilar appearance.
• Garage fronts are de-emphasized and not the most prominent architectural feature of the
house. The use of side load garages, rear load garages, detached garages, or L-shaped

space, shall not be counted toward minimum open space requirements. Land proposed as open
space shall be suitable in size, shape, and location for conservation and recreational purposes.
C. Within a residential cluster development, no lot shall be approved, recorded, or sold
within the development until a declaration of covenants and restrictions or other document,
necessary to establish a permanent homeowners association responsible for the care and
maintenance of open space, has been approved by the City and has been executed. In lieu of such
a homeowners association, the City may approve the use of a conservation organization which
shall be responsible for owning or otherwise having jurisdiction over the open space for purposes
of care and maintenance.
D. Special Service Area. The City, at its discretion, may require the establishment of a
“back up” special service area (SSA) in order to provide funds necessary to support the
maintenance and upkeep of land set side and dedicated as open space area or used for required
utilities and development improvements. Such a requirement may be a condition of final plat
approval and the creation of such an SSA shall occur prior to the sale of individual lots or building
sites.

6A.2 Improvement Guarantees
6A.2.1 General Standards
Improvement guarantees are required to ensure the safe, timely, and proper installation and
maintenance of required public and site improvements in the City. The type and duration of the
guarantee is structured to achieve this goal without adding unnecessary costs for either the
developer or the City. Prior to the recording of a final plat, the start of improvement construction,
and the issuance of building permits, the developer shall post a letter of credit, bond, or cash
escrow with the City to guarantee the construction of all required public and site improvements.
The term “letter of credit” when used in this Ordinance may be used interchangeably with the
term “bond”. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
6A.2.2 Cash Escrow Requirements
A. Establishing Account. An escrow account in the amount required shall be established
with a financial institution located in the State of Illinois (hereinafter referred to as the
escrowee) which is acceptable to the City Attorney. The account shall be administered
by the escrowee in accordance with the provisions of an escrow agreement negotiated by
the City and the owner or developer and approved by the City Attorney. Such agreement
shall contain provisions for specific application of such funds, partial contract payouts,
contract retention percentages until completion, the prorated reduction of deposit excess,
final escrow settlement, and other pertinent administrative matters as may be required.
B. Fund Disbursement. The escrowee shall disburse funds from time to time for the
purposes provided upon presentation of and in accordance with a reduction request issued
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.4
by the owner’s engineer and approved by the City Engineer. Such disbursements shall
not be subject to approval or disapproval by the owner or escrowee or their agents other
than said owner’s engineer. Each reduction request shall be accompanied by all
appropriate sworn statements, affidavits and supporting waivers of lien in full compliance
with the Illinois Mechanics Lien Act.
6A.2.3 Letter of Credit and Bond Requirements
The developer may file a commercial letter of credit or bond from any financial institution
located in the State of Illinois in a form acceptable to the City of Woodstock. The letter of credit
shall be in an amount approved by the City Engineer and sufficient to pay for the cost of
construction of public and site improvements and all engineering costs including the engineering
and inspection fees of the applicant or owner. This amount shall equal 110% of the engineer’s
approved estimate of cost for all proposed improvements excluding buildings. The letter of credit
must provide that the issuing financial institution shall pay to the City such amounts as may be
required to complete the improvements according to the approved plans and specifications. The
amount of the letter of credit may be reduced from time to time as payments for improvements
approved by the City Engineer are made. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20,
2009).
6A.2.4 Improvement Guarantee Reductions
Reductions in the amount of the improvement guarantee may be initiated by the developer or the
City. If initiated by the developer, the reduction request shall be in written form and shall include
copies of plans, cost estimates, test reports, certifications, construction schedules and/or other
documentation as required by the City Engineer to justify the request. Upon receipt of a request
to reduce the amount of the improvement guarantee, the City Engineer shall inspect the
improvements guaranteed under the improvement guarantee. If the inspection is successful, the
City Engineer may approve the partial or full release of funds or the return of a Letter of Credit in
writing. If the inspection is unsuccessful, the developer shall be responsible for correcting all
deficiencies and/or addressing all items needing corrective action as determined by the City
Engineer.
6A.2.5 Insufficient Fund Balance
If, at any time before the construction of all required improvements is completed, the remaining
undisbursed fund balance of an escrow account or letter of credit is not sufficient in the sole
judgment of the City Engineer to cover the cost of construction of required public and site
improvements and all engineering costs or if by reason of any order, decree or writ of any court,
or for any other reason, the undisbursed fund balance is withheld, diminished or otherwise
unavailable for the purposes provided herein, the developer shall increase the balance to such
amount as required by the City for such purposes or shall provide such guarantee of performance
as may be required by the City.
6A.2.6 Guarantee Amount
The amount of the performance guarantee shall be sufficient to cover all construction costs and
the applicant’s engineering and inspection costs. Such guarantee shall be in the following
minimum amounts unless the applicant can show that certain of the costs have already been paid:
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.5
A. Construction Cost: One hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated construction cost
prepared by the applicant’ engineer and as approved by the City Engineer.
B. City Engineering and Inspection Costs: To be paid for separately by the developer and or
owner prior to beginning any work. The fee shall be equivalent to seven (7) percent of
the construction cost estimate prepared by the applicant’s engineer and approved by the
City Engineer. The City Engineer may, upon good cause and at his/her discretion,
require a fee of less than seven (7) percent. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted
October 20, 2009).
6A.2.7 Time Limits
All performance guarantees shall provide that if required improvements are not installed within
two (2) years of the date of recording of a final plat, the City Engineer may deem the developer in
default and proceed in accordance with the provisions outlined under the following section
entitled "Default". In the event the City Engineer determines that the developer has failed to
install proposed improvements in accordance with the approved plans and specifications or has
failed to comply with the terms of the aforesaid guarantees, the City Engineer may advise the
applicant of failure in writing and give thirty (30) days to cure such default. If the developer fails
to cure said default, the City may at its option, declare applicant in default and, upon written
notification to escrowee and/or financial institution of such declaration of default, all funds on
deposit pursuant to the escrow agreement and/or letter of credit shall be disbursed by escrowee
solely upon authorization of the City Engineer and escrowee and/or financial institution shall be
released by the said developer as to such payment.
6A.2.8 Maintenance Guarantee
The developer shall guarantee all public improvements against defects in materials and
workmanship for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of acceptance of public
improvements or approval of private improvements which, during said eighteen (18) month
period may become damaged or deficient due to defective materials or workmanship or
otherwise. No maintenance period shall end between the first day of November and the first day
of April. Final inspections prior to the release of maintenance guarantee funds will be conducted
between the first day of April and the first day of October. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted
October 20, 2009).
6A.2.9 Conditions of Maintenance Guarantee
The developer shall establish a cash escrow account or provide a letter of credit in an amount
equal to ten (10) percent of the final construction costs of public improvements. The purpose of
such cash escrow account or letter of credit is to guarantee the availability of funds to replace
defective materials within the limits of the improvements. Said escrow account or letter of credit
shall remain in force for an eighteen (18) month maintenance period and shall be available for use
by the City to implement repairs deemed necessary for public safety and which the applicant has
neglected to repair within forty-eight (48) hours of notification. Disbursements from the cash
escrow account or pursuant to the letter of credit shall be made solely upon the direction of the
City and shall not be subject to approval or disapproval by the applicant or escrowee or the
financial institution issuing the letter of credit or their agents.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.6
6A.2.10 Return of Funds
Within forty-five (45) days following the eighteen (18) month maintenance period and upon
acceptance of said improvements and upon receipt of a written request, the City will return
remaining funds to the financial institution which supplied the escrow funds or return the letter of
credit. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
6A.3 Pre-Construction Meeting
A. Prior to starting the installation of required subdivision/PUD improvements a preconstruction
meeting shall be held with the City Engineer to inform the developer of the
City's ordinances, regulations, policies, and requirements pertaining to such construction.
The pre-construction meeting should be attended by the developer's engineer, site
contractor, and site inspector.
B. Items discussed during the pre-construction meeting shall include the following:
permitted hours of construction, siltation fencing and erosion control, required
improvement inspections and reports, maintenance of public improvements, site access,
tree protection and preservation, off-site deposition of dirt and debris, the placement of
dirt, debris, and/or construction material on public right-of-way, construction vehicle and
equipment access routes, materials to be used, and emergency contacts. The cost of
conducting required inspections for any public improvements, whether said inspections
are conducted by City personnel or by the developer’s site inspector, shall be the
responsibility of the developer.
C. Building permits for new construction shall not be issued until required public
improvements are installed and serve the building site. Such public improvements shall
include sanitary sewer, storm sewer, potable water, stormwater detention and
management, and a paved street surface, i.e., binder course. Permission may be granted
by the Community Development Director to begin installation of building footings,
foundations, and underground plumbing and sewer improvements, and similar building
features prior to the installation of said public improvements and in order to avoid
restrictions which may occur due to inclement or seasonal weather conditions. Such
activity, however, is done entirely at the owner’s risk.
6A.4 Site Debris
The developer shall be responsible for containing and securing on the site, and for removing from
the site, undergrowth, debris, rubbish, trash, excess dirt, or any other unsightly materials upon the
development site, including that, which is generated by construction and development activity.
Such materials shall not be burned on the site. Treatment and disposal of sanitary and industrial
wastes shall be in conformity with the published standards of the State of Illinois.
(Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).

described on the final plat.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.7
A. Reference must be made upon the plat to known and permanent monuments from which
future surveys may be made.
B. The surveyor must, at the time of making his survey, set in such manner that they will not
be moved by frost, monuments marking the external boundaries of the tract to be divided
or subdivided and must designate upon the plat the point where they may be found.
These monuments shall be placed at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point
where a curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line, and at all angle points
along a meander line, the points to be not less than 20 feet back from the normal water
elevation of a lake or from the bank of a stream; except that when such corners or points
fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments must be placed in the rightof-
way line of the street. Two of the monuments must be of stone or reinforced concrete
and must be set at opposite extremities of the property being platted. One such
monument shall be marked with a U.S.G.S. elevation established by the surveyor and its
location and elevation shown on the plat.
C. All internal boundaries, corners and points must be monumented in the field. These
monuments must be placed at all block corners, at each end of all curves, at the points
where a curve changes its radius, and at all angle points in any line. All lots must be
monumented in the field with 2 or more monuments.
D. The aforesaid monument standards may be altered by the City Engineer based on factors
unique to a development site or if alternative monument standards are determined to be
acceptable by the City Engineer.
6A.6 Site Grading and Excavating
No grading, excavating, or filling of a subdivision/PUD site shall commence until applicable
improvement guarantees have been provided and a pre-construction meeting held. Plans for
grading, excavating, and filling shall be prepared and constructed in accordance with the
specifications of the City.
The mass grading of development sites is limited to between 20 and 40 acres at any one time.
Large developments shall stabilize areas of up to 40 acres that are graded before proceeding with
subsequent grading activity. Areas of the site that have been rough-graded, but will not be subject
to immediate building and development activity shall be seeded to lessen wind, soil, and water
erosion.
Buffers installed to protect natural resources and amenities, or buffers which are located in close
proximity to or abut such natural resources and amenities, shall be planted and stabilized prior to
the start of grading activity.
6A.7 Off-site Improvements
The Plan Commission may recommend and the City Council may require the installation of offsite
improvements. Such improvements may include, but are not limited to streets, sidewalks,
and public utilities. The need for such improvements shall be specifically attributable to the
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.8
proposed subdivision/PUD unless the development site is the subject of a proposed annexation
agreement, in which case the terms of such agreement shall apply and have precedence.

McHenry County Recorder.
6A.9 General Subdivision and PUD Procedures
6A.9.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to set forth the process for obtaining subdivision/PUD approval and
to provide a description of required documents and materials which must be submitted in order
for the City to review and verify compliance with the standards and specifications set forth herein
and elsewhere in this Ordinance.
6A.9.2 Application
Application for subdivision/PUD approval shall be made on forms provided by the City and shall
be accompanied by required documents and materials, as well as required filing fees and
development review fees. Detailed material and other information, including public hearing
requirements, specified by this Chapter shall be required for the various meetings and at such
times as prescribed by the Community Development Director. Each step shall be reviewed and
certified by the Community Development Director as being in accordance with the requirements
of this Chapter. Specific procedures and content requirements for subdivision/PUD approval are
set forth in Chapters 6B and 6C. Additional standards for PUD projects are set forth in Chapter 5
of this Ordinance.
As noted in Section 1.9 of this Ordinance, when an application pertaining to land depicted as
“resource conservation” or “resource conservation corridor” in the City’s comprehensive
planning documents, or for land that is characterized by sensitive natural resources, is submitted
for subdivision/PUD approval, compliance with the conservation design standards and
requirements set forth in Chapter 8 of this Ordinance is required unless waived by the Plan
Commission.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.9
6A.9.3 Owner/Applicant
An application for subdivision or PUD approval may be filed by the owner of the subject property
or by the owner’s authorized representative. A contract purchaser of the subject property may be
designated as the owner’s authorized representative.
6A.10 Vacations
This section establishes required approval procedures for vacating plats, streets, alleys,
easements, public places, or parts thereof.
Commentary:
To implement the goal of protecting sensitive natural resources, these regulations encourage
subdivision/planned unit development design that preserves natural resources and other significant
environmental features. The following step-by-step “conservation design” process provides guidance
in designing developments which acknowledge the importance of ecologically sensitive resources and
the need to maintain and protect environmental amenities and features of a site.
The foremost factor to consider when developing property is the land. The first step is to identify all
natural resources (floodplain, wetlands, lakes, ponds, channels and other water bodies, steep slopes,
mature and young woodlands and significant trees, meadows and prairies, and soil types) that are
present on the site. Significant vistas and scenic areas that are present on the property and worthy of
preservation should also be identified.
This step will provide an indication of areas that are free of sensitive natural resources and other
significant features where building and development activity should occur on a property. The McHenry
County Soil and Water Conservation Service maintains information that may be used initially to identify
the natural resources and conservation areas at the pre-application stage of the subdivision approval
process.
The second step is locating building sites. Once natural and conservation areas are identified, building
sites should be located to take advantage of open space and scenic views. Smaller lot areas and
smaller lot widths which maximize the number of lots facing natural and conservation areas should be
considered in order to provide more efficient use of the usable land.
After open space and conservation lands have been identified and building locations established, the
third step is to design the street and circulation network to provide access to building sites and to allow
movement throughout the subdivision. The street layout should avoid sensitive natural resources such
as wetlands, woodlands, significant tree stands, and wildlife habitats, and should be designed to take
advantage of open space vistas. Interconnection of internal streets and street connections to adjoining
lands should be provided to create opportunities for future connectivity.
The fourth step, after conservation areas are identified, building sites established, and streets located,
is to establish lot lines. A mix of building styles and uses will allow for flexible lot sizes and design, and
enable a subdivision to take maximum advantage of conservation subdivision concepts
The fifth and final step in this process Is to determine how each building site can be served by essential
public utilities. This may require innovation on the part of the engineering professional in order to
provide utility service while protecting natural resources and amenities.
Additional information regarding the protection and preservation of natural resources can be found in
Chapter 8 (Conservation Design Standards and Regulations) and Exhibit I (Conservation Subdivision
Design).

strict compliance with the subdivision and PUD regulations of the City, or where as a practical
matter said regulations are not applicable or necessary, or where better site design and
development amenities will result, it may approve or approve with specific conditions, requested
subdivision variations or exceptions to the requirements of these regulations. Such variations or
exceptions shall not, however, have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these
regulations. A petition for such a variation or exception shall be presented to the Plan
Commission for a recommendation prior to the petition being presented to and acted upon by the
City Council. Such a petition may be reviewed by the Plan Commission at the same time a
preliminary plat or final plat is presented for review. A separate public hearing on such a
variation is not required.
6A.12 Waivers of Submittal Requirements
In the event the Plan Commission determines that any of the items or materials required as part of
an application are not necessary or applicable, the Commission may waive the requirement if the
waiver is consistent with the purpose of these regulations and not required by State statutes. Such
a waiver shall be reviewed at the same time a pre-application review submittal or preliminary plat
is presented to the Plan Commission. A separate public hearing on such petition is not required.
An appeal of the Plan Commission’s determination regarding waivers of submittal requirements
may be presented to the City Council by the developer and must be submitted for City Council
consideration within no more than thirty (30) days of the Plan Commission’s action.
6A.13 Appeals of Subdivision and PUD Decisions
Developers aggrieved by decisions or determinations of the Community Development Director or
City Engineer regarding the subdivision of land or a PUD, and the improvements required
therein, may appeal such decisions or determinations to the City Manager. A request for an
appeal must be made in writing within twenty-one (21) days of the decision or determination.
The City Manager may act to uphold or overturn the action of the Community Development
Director or City Engineer. If aggrieved by the City Manager’s decision regarding such appeal,
the developer may appeal to the City Council.
6A.14 Recording a Final Plat
Approval of a final plat shall be effective upon its recording with the McHenry County Recorder.
Such recording shall occur no more than twelve (12) months after approval of the final plat by the
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition – City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6A.12
City Council. Failure to record the final plat by this deadline shall require its full resubmittal
before the Plan Commission and City Council. After the final plat is recorded, certified copies
shall be submitted to the City. Final covenants or restrictions governing the use and maintenance
of the subdivision shall be recorded at the same time that the final plat is recorded. In order to
provide additional time in which to record a final plat, a one-time extension of final plat approval
for up to one (1) year may be granted by the Community Development Director. Any additional
extensions may only be granted by the City Council.
6A.15 Final Plat Changes
A subdivision or PUD shall be developed according to the approved and recorded final plat and
all supporting data. The recorded final plat and supporting data, together with any and all
recorded amendments, shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and assigns,
and shall limit and control the use of the development site as set forth herein. Changes to the
recorded final plat may be made as provided for herein.
6A.15.1 Major Changes
Major changes are changes which alter the concept or intent of an approved subdivision or PUD
including, but not limited to, increases in density and/or the number of lots, and changes in road
standards or location. A major change shall include the following:
 An increase in the number of dwelling units by more than 5 percent.
 An increase in the floor area devoted to non-residential uses by more than 5 percent.
 An increase in the impervious surface devoted to nonresidential uses by more than 10
percent.
 An increase in impervious surfaces by more than 10,000 square feet.
 A decrease in the amount of dedicated open space by more than 5 percent.
Such changes may only be approved by the submission of an amended final plat and by following
applicable final plat procedures. All major changes to the final plat shall be recorded with the
McHenry County Recorder as amendments to the final plat or as a new and corrected final plat.
The Community Development Director shall determine what constitutes a “major change”.
Major changes may require revisions to final engineering plans.
6A.15.2 Minor Changes
Minor changes are any changes that do not comprise a “major change.” Minor changes may
include such activities as adding accessory structures or additions to principal structures or
adjusting the location of principal structures in order to accommodate required site
improvements, provided they do not meet the threshold for classification as a “major
modification.” The Community Development Director, after consultation with the City Engineer
regarding relevant site engineering issues and with the City Planner regarding applicable site
appearance issues, may from time to time, approve minor changes within the project. The
Community Development Director may approve minor changes in the final plat which do not
change the concept or intent of the development or that are in conflict with the provisions and
intent of this Ordinance.

PRE-APPLICATION AND PRELIMINARY
PLAT APPROVAL PROCESSES
6B.1 Subdivision/PUD Pre-Application Process
6B.2 Subdivision/PUD Preliminary Plat Process
6B.1 Subdivision/PUD Pre-Application Process
6B.1.1 Purpose
The purpose of pre-application review is to allow the developer to become better informed about
the City’s subdivision/PUD requirements and for the City Administration and/or Plan
Commission to learn what the developer is proposing and to provide relevant comments.
The Community Development Director or the developer may request that pre-application review
material be presented to the Plan Commission for purposes of informal discussion and input.
Such discussion shall occur at a regularly scheduled Plan Commission meeting. Except as
provided for in this Ordinance, comments made by the City Administration or Plan Commission
during a pre-application review discussion are advisory only and not binding on either the
applicant, the City administration, the Plan Commission, or the City.
6B.1.2 Procedure & Content
Before filing an application for plat approval, the developer shall meet with the Community
Development Director and other relevant City personnel. In preparation for this meeting the
applicant shall submit a sketch plan containing the name of the development, the name/address of
both the property owner and the developer, north arrow, a scale of not less than one inch to onehundred
feet, present zoning and zoning on abutting land, date of preparation, number and size of
proposed lots, and the acreage of the site shall also be provided. The applicant’s submittal shall
include information regarding site conditions and land characteristics, including but not limited to
the following materials:
 a plat of survey and legal description of the subject site.
 a location map of the subject site.
 existing and proposed zoning, and a description of proposed land uses.
 proposed lot lines and dimensions, building and structure locations, the location of
existing streets and lots abutting the site, and the number of occupancy units. The sketch
plan shall also depict proposed streets, and surrounding land uses, major development
features, and the general location of natural and environmental resources, including
woodlands, wetlands, floodplain, and soil conditions.
The sketch plan shall be prepared on 24 inch by 36 inch sheets. The sketch plan is not intended
to be completed as a precisely engineered plan but must contain sufficient detail to permit a
technical and planning review.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6B.2
6B.1.3 Pre-application Referrals
The Community Development Director shall forward the pre-application review material to the
Woodstock Fire/Rescue District for review and input regarding fire safety and emergency access.
If the proposed subdivision/PUD contains a residential component, the pre-application review
material shall be forwarded to (1) the Parks and Recreation Commission for review and
recommendations regarding the need for and location of public park amenities, and to (2)
Woodstock Community Unit School District 200 for review and input regarding impact on school
capacity and access.
6B.2 Subdivision/PUD Preliminary Plat Process
6B.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of a preliminary plat is to allow the City to evaluate a proposed development and its
impact on the surrounding area and community, to comment on its design, and to provide
direction as to how to the developer should proceed. The preliminary plat indicates the layout
and design of a subdivision/PUD, and includes information pertaining to proposed streets, lot
lines, physical characteristics, environmental features, and preliminary site engineering
improvements. An approved preliminary plat gives the developer a commitment from the City
that the development design is acceptable and that preparation of required final engineering plans
and final plat documents may begin.
6B.2.2 Public Hearing Requirement
Because the subdivision/PUD submittal may include a request for variations, waivers, or
exceptions, or because required zoning specifications may be amended as part of the
subdivision/PUD approval process, the Plan Commission shall conduct a public hearing on all
preliminary plat submittals. Neighbor, newspaper, and posted notices shall be provided for all
public hearings in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. Owners of all property
within 250 feet of the subject property shall be notified. The petitioner shall deliver in person or
mail notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to either (1) the owner(s), as recorded in
the office of the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds; or (2) the person(s) who last paid property
taxes as reflected in the tax records of the McHenry County Treasurer. The date for the public
hearing shall be established by the Community Development Director. (Ordinance Number 09-
O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
6B.2.3 Preliminary Plat Procedure
A. Written application for preliminary plat review shall be made in a manner prescribed by
the City. The application shall be accompanied by required fees, supporting data, plans,
and other required information to indicate the extent and nature of the subdivision.
B. The preliminary plat application and supporting data shall be reviewed by the
Community Development Director to determine its compliance with submittal requirements.
Once the application and the supporting data are deemed complete, copies of it
shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for a recommendation.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6B.3
C. The Plan Commission shall review the preliminary plat to determine that the purpose and
intent of these regulations are carried out. After conducting a required public hearing on
the preliminary plat, the Plan Commission shall recommend to the City Council approval,
approval with conditions, or disapproval, or indicate the reasons why a recommendation
cannot be made. Such a recommendation shall be made within thirty (30) days following
the date on which the required public hearing is concluded and closed. This time frame
may be extended to a specific date at the request of the Plan Commission subject to the
petitioner agreeing to such extension.
D. If the Plan Commission recommends disapproval of a preliminary plat or does not render
a recommendation, the Community Development Director shall provide the applicant
with written notification indicating the effect of the Commission’s recommendation, the
reasons for the Commission’s action, and direction for continuing the preliminary plat
approval process.
E. The Plan Commission’s action shall be valid for 12 months, within which time the
preliminary plat must be presented to the City Council for consideration. If the
preliminary plat is not submitted within this time frame, the Plan Commission’s
recommendation shall expire and be void.
F. After receiving a required recommendation from the Plan Commission, the City Council
shall approve, approve with conditions and/or modifications, or disapprove the
preliminary plat, or may refer it back to the Plan Commission for additional
consideration. The City Council’s action shall occur within thirty (30) days following the
date on which the preliminary plat submittal is presented to the City for consideration and
placed on a City Council meeting agenda. This time frame may be extended to a specific
date at the request of the City Council subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension.
G. Approval of a preliminary plat by the City Council is valid for a time period of 12
months. Within this time period, final engineering plans shall be submitted to the City
Engineer and a final plat for the first phase of development or for the entire
subdivision/PUD shall be submitted to the Community Development Director. If said
submittals do not occur within the specified time frame, the preliminary plat shall expire
and be void, unless said 12 month time period is extended to a specific date by the City
Council at its discretion. (Ordinance Number 10-O-39, adopted August 3, 2010).
H. Approval of a preliminary plat constitutes acceptance of the overall planning and design
concepts and, except as provided for herein, is a prerequisite for the filing of a final plat.
Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it
shall be deemed an expression of preliminary approval of the layout depicted on the
preliminary plat and a guide to the preparation of final plat documents. Such approval
allows the applicant to proceed with the preparation of final engineering plans and final
plat documents.
6B.2.4 Preliminary Plat Content

Commentary:
The Illinois Statutes, 70 ILCS 405/22-02a, establish criteria for when a Natural Resources
Information (NRI) report is required. The responsibility for applying for, receiving, and
submitting such a report to the City is with the developer. An NRI shall be in place at the time
the preliminary plat is submitted. The developer is responsible for demonstrating how natural
resource issues raised in the NRI have been or will be addressed.
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources’ (IDNR) consultation process, as discussed in the
Illinois Compiled Statutes, 520 ILCS 10/11, shall be initiated before Preliminary Plat approval
and completed before Final Engineering Plan approval. The developer is responsible for
submitting all necessary documents and for following through with the consultation process.
Based on the consultation process, additional area may need to be set aside or additional
measures taken to protect natural resource areas.

FINAL PLAT AND FINAL ENGINEERING
PLAN CONTENT AND APPROVAL PROCESSES
6C.1 Subdivision/PUD Final Plat Process
6C.2 Subdivision/PUD Final Engineering Plans
6C.1 Subdivision/PUD Final Plat Process
6C.1.1 Purpose
The purpose of a final plat is to indicate the final layout of a subdivision/PUD and to depict
proposed streets, lot lines, easements, and signatures of approval. A final plat shall be drawn in
general accordance with the approved preliminary plat. A final plat, upon recording, legally
creates the subdivision/PUD. Minor changes may be made to the final plat in order to
accommodate necessary site improvements and engineering requirements, subject to the approval
of the Community Development Director.
6C.1.2 Final Plat Procedure
A. After approval of a preliminary plat by the City Council and the fulfillment of the
requirements of these regulations, written application for final plat review shall be made
in the manner prescribed by the City. The application shall be accompanied by required
supporting data, plans, and other required information and shall be presented to the
Community Development Director. Said application materials shall be submitted at least
45 days prior to the regular meeting at which they are expected to be considered by the
Plan Commission.
B. A final plat shall be in substantial conformance with the approved preliminary plat. A
final plat may be for the entire development site or may be submitted in phases for a
portion of the site. A final plat for a phase of a subdivision/PUD shall conform to all
requirements and regulations contained in this Chapter and with Woodstock’s
engineering standards and specifications in effect at the time of plat consideration,
regardless of when the preliminary plat was approved.
C. Final engineering plans shall be substantially approved by the City Engineer prior to final
plat consideration by the Plan Commission and City Council. The City Engineer may
approve final engineering plans subject to specific revisions and/or conditions.
D. The final plat and any supporting data shall be reviewed by the Community Development
Director to determine its compliance with these regulations and that it is in substantial
conformance with the approved preliminary plat. Once the final plat and any required
supporting data are deemed complete, it shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for
consideration. A final plat shall not be presented to the Plan Commission until it has
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 6C.2
been determined that there are no outstanding invoices, liens, or similar financial
encumbrances on the subdivision/PUD site which are payable and due to the City.
E. The Plan Commission shall review the final plat to determine that it is in substantial
conformance with the approved preliminary plat. The Plan Commission shall approve,
approve with conditions, or deny approval of the final plat, or indicate why action cannot
be taken. Such action shall occur within thirty (30) days following the date on which the
final plat is placed on a Plan Commission meeting agenda and consideration of the final
plat commences. This time frame may be extended to a specific date at the request of the
Plan Commission subject to the petitioner agreeing to such extension. The Plan
Commission’s action shall be valid for twelve months, within which time the final plat
shall be presented to the City for City Council consideration. Failure to present the final
plat to the City Council within this time frame shall result in said plat being void.
F. If the Plan Commission does not approve a final plat or does not make a decision, the
Community Development Director shall notify the applicant of the effect of the
Commission’s action, the reasons for said action, and directions for continuing the final
plat approval process.
G. Regardless of the Plan Commission’s action, the City Council shall approve, approve
with conditions, or disapprove the final plat. The City Council’s action shall occur
within thirty (30) days following the date on which the final plat is placed on a City
Council meeting agenda and consideration of the final plat commences. This time frame
may be extended to a specific date at the request of the City Council subject to the
petitioner agreeing to such extension. Approval of a final plat by the City Council is
valid for a time period of one year, within which time the final plat must be recorded.
H. If final plat approval is applied for in phases, application for all subsequent phases shall
be made no later than 6 years after preliminary plat approval has been granted. If
application for approval of final plats for subsequent phases has not been made within the
specified deadline, the preliminary plat shall expire for that phase. Upon application by
the owner of the property, the Plan Commission may extend the applicable submission

A. Purpose. The purpose of establishing these zoning districts in the City and the requirements and
restrictions in each of these districts is:
1. to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public;
2. to provide for adequate light, air, convenience of access, and safety from fire, flood, and
other dangers;
3. to reduce or prevent congestion;
4. to facilitate the provision of adequate public services; and
5. to protect against the overcrowding of land and undue density of population in relation to
community facilities;
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.2
B. Zoning Map. The boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance are shown
on the “Official Zoning Map of the City of Woodstock, Illinois,” which is a part of this Ordinance. An
original zoning district map is maintained in the Community Development Department. In case of any
dispute regarding the zoning classification of property subject to this Ordinance, the original map
maintained in the Community Development Department shall control.
Commentary:
A zoning map will depict individual lots and parcels, as well as zoning districts within a municipality. Land that is
surrounded by a municipality, but not annexed, will be labeled “out” and will not have a municipal zoning
designation. A partial rendering of Woodstock’s zoning map is provided below.
1. District Boundaries
a. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, zoning district boundaries shown as
following or approximately following streets, alleys, and similar physical features
shall be construed to follow the centerlines of such physical features.
b. All streets, alleys, public ways and railroad right-of-way, if not otherwise specifically
designated, are deemed to be in the same zoning district as the property immediately
abutting said streets, alleys, public ways and railroad right-of-way.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.3
c. Zoning district boundary lines shown as following or approximately following the
centerlines of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing watercourses shall be
construed as following the channel centerline of such watercourses. In the event of a
natural change in the location of those streams, rivers, or other watercourses, the
zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
d. Zoning district boundary lines shown as following or approximately following
platted lot lines or other property lines shall be construed as following those lines.
e. Where a lot or parcel held in single ownership and of record on the effective date of
this Ordinance is divided by a zoning district boundary, the entire lot may be
construed to have the same zoning designation as the majority of said lot or parcel.
When such a lot abuts lots or parcels that are in a more restrictive zoning district, a
10 foot wide buffer area shall be required and shall consist of landscaping materials,
fencing, or similar materials.
f. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, zoning district boundaries shown as
following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to lie midway
between the main tracks of said railroad lines.
g. Where the above regulations fail to clarify the zoning status of land in a particular
case, the Community Development Director shall determine said zoning status in
such a manner as to carry out the intent and purpose of this Ordinance. An appeal
from the interpretation of the Community Development Director may be made to the
Zoning Board of Appeals in the manner provided for herein.
2. Map Scale and Distances
Zoning district boundaries shown as separate from and parallel or approximately parallel
to any of the features listed in this section shall be considered parallel to those features
and at such distances as are shown on the map. Distances not specifically indicated on
the map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
3. Unclassified or Annexed Land
It is the intent of this Ordinance that the entire area within the municipal boundaries of
the City of Woodstock be classified in a zoning district. All lands within the municipal
boundary which are not classified in a zoning district shall be classified in the AG
district. Any land annexed into the City shall automatically be classified in the AG
district until such time as rezoned by the City Council.
7A.2 District Descriptions
A. Agriculture District
The AG agriculture zoning district permits land use activity that is compatible with existing rural
character and agricultural uses while not permanently preventing future development options.
When population growth or other forces establishes a need or desire on the part of the City to
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.4
convert land from the AG designation to a higher intensity zoning classification, these areas may
be rezoned to permit more intensive uses. Residential dwellings, home occupations, and low
intensity agricultural activity, including but not limited to the preparation, cultivation, and/or sale
of ornamental floral arrangements, seeds, and greenhouse products, are permitted on tracts that
meet the standards of this zoning district or where a special use permit has been approved.
Commentary:
Intensive agricultural uses are most suitable outside the City of Woodstock where land parcels are large enough to
accommodate farming and the raising of livestock, where the risk of coming into conflict with urban land activity is
minimal, and where the need for municipal water and sanitary sewer services does not exist or where the provision
of such services is impractical. In some instances, the AG zoning designation serves as a means of placing
development activity “on hold” until such time as the City determines a more appropriate zoning designation and
permanent use.
B. Estate District
The E estate zoning district provides areas for low-density, larger residential home sites with a
maximum of one dwelling unit per acre. Properties zoned E should include only those tracts that
abut or are in close proximity to existing large-lot single family development, and may also be
appropriate for areas where topography or natural features make conventional urban development
difficult or impractical. Tracts with an E zoning designation may serve as an appropriate
transition between rural, agricultural, and urban uses. The creation of unique development sites is
encouraged on such land, especially when it is characterized by topographic diversity, woodlands,
wetlands, and other environmental amenities and resources. The E district is expected to provide
land for only a small amount of the City’s housing stock. It primarily serves those households
which desire to live in a rural, low-density area and that are willing to assume the costs of doing
so. Residential dwellings and home occupations are permitted on tracts that meet the standards of
this zoning district.
C. Single Family Detached Residential Districts
The R, R1B, R1C, and R1D single family detached residential zoning districts contain a
significant portion of the City’s single family residential development. These districts are
intended to accommodate a wide range of housing types and sizes, and to provide low to
moderate density residential development served by municipal services and amenities.
Residential dwellings and home occupations are permitted on tracts that meet the standards of this
zoning district.
D. Single Family Attached Residential District
The R3 zoning district is also intended to accommodate portions of the City’s residential
development. This district provides opportunities for higher-density attached dwellings, such as
duplexes, townhomes or rowhouses. Attached residential dwellings and home occupations are
permitted on tracts that meet the standards of this zoning district.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.5
E. Multiple Family Residential District
The R4 zoning district allows the highest residential density in the City and provides
opportunities for apartment dwellings and multi-family residences. Multiple family structures are
permitted to have up to 24 apartment dwelling units and shall comply with architectural,
aesthetic, and landscape guidelines adopted by the City. This district should be located so that it
will not interfere with or damage environmentally sensitive lands and to ensure that adequate
open space and recreational facilities are located nearby or within the zoning district itself to
serve the needs of the persons who are or will be living in the district. A special use permit is
required in order to build a structure with more than 24 apartment dwelling units.
F. Neighborhood Business District
Business establishments in the B1 zoning district are intended to serve the immediate needs of the
surrounding neighborhood and to accommodate neighborhood oriented, low-intensity retail sales
and service uses. The B1 zoning designation is appropriate in existing residential neighborhoods
and for new residential developments that include a mixed-use component.
G. General Business District and Central Business District
The B2 zoning district is intended to provide the widest variety of goods, services, and mercantile
functions within the City. The B2C zoning district is also intended to provide this same variety in
the area typically identified as Woodstock’s “downtown,” while providing this variety in such a
way that land uses are easily accessible by walking and compatible with both public and private
parking facilities. The B2C district seeks to protect, preserve, and enhance historic and
architectural character, conserve the value of buildings, and encourage appropriate use of land in
the downtown.
This district acknowledges that Woodstock’s downtown contributes significantly to the City’s
overall image; that the economic vitality of the downtown is important to the overall welfare of
the City; that the proper use of property in the downtown will offer social and cultural benefits to
the citizens of Woodstock; that a diversity of business, office, institutional, park and residential
uses is desirable and appropriate in the core area of the City; that standards and criteria which
encourage new buildings, retain the values of surrounding land parcels, and protect the City’s
traditional character will promote good urban design; and that the encouragement of development
within walking distance of the train depot and at sufficient densities that will support the station
and downtown businesses is a wise use of land.
H. Service & Retail District
The B3 zoning district allows for the establishment of a variety of retail and service uses which
are convenient to motorists and accessible to major streets and transportation routes. The B3
district is compatible with the B2, B4, B5 and M1 zoning districts and the uses allowed within
them.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.6
I. Office District
The B4 zoning district is intended to be used for office activities, civic uses, and similar activity,
especially when adjacent to major streets and transportation routes. The B4 district may be used
for the establishment of permanent buffers or transitional areas between residential development
and more intensive business activity.
J. Shopping Center District
The B5 zoning district is intended for a variety of compatible commercial, retail, and some
service activities on a single zoning lot. Such uses are adjacent to major streets and transportation
routes.
K. Light Manufacturing District
The M1 zoning district is intended for a mix of light manufacturing, office, warehousing, or
research and development uses, as well as limited service uses. Such uses are intended to be in an
attractive business setting with proper screening, landscaping, or buffering, and compatible with
adjoining non-industrial land uses. Uses in the M1 zoning district do not typically exhibit
offensive characteristics and are associated with small start-up or incubator businesses.
L. Heavy Manufacturing District
The M2 zoning district provides opportunities for industrial and manufacturing facilities which
are located on or near major transportation routes. Uses in the M2 zoning district are typically
more intensive than those permitted in the M1 zoning district and include, but are not limited to
manufacturing, fabrication, assembly, compounding, processing, and office activities.
7A.3 Bulk and Area Standards
A. Lot Area, Width and Depth
The terms “lot area”, “lot width” and “lot depth” shall have the meaning set forth in Chapter 2 of this
Ordinance.
B. Area, Width and Lot Requirements
The following standards and specifications shall pertain to area, width, and lot requirements, except as
may be waived and/or amended by the City Council or when included as part of a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) or Traditional Neighborhood Development(TND).

be based on the number of units in a structure.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.7
3. There shall be only one principal use on a lot or parcel, except in the B1, B2, B2C, B3,
B4, B5, M1 and M2 zoning districts or as otherwise provided for in this Ordinance.
4. For all single family attached dwellings and multiple family dwellings, the density and
number of dwelling units permitted on a lot or parcel shall be based on the actual number
of units in a structure, and shall not exceed the number of units set forth in Table 7A.2.
5. General uses not listed in Table 7A.2 under specific residential zoning districts shall
comply with the lot area and lot width specifications required in the M1 zoning district,
including those for lot coverage and height.
6. Except as otherwise permitted in this Ordinance, every principal building constructed or
erected shall be situated on a lot or parcel which abuts upon a public street or upon an
established access easement having a minimum width of thirty (30) feet and recorded
prior to January 1, 2006. Flag lots are not permitted.
7. The minimum lot width for attached or multiple family dwelling structures shall be the
sum of the width required for the first dwelling unit, plus the width required for each
additional dwelling unit.
C. Yard and Setback Measurements
1. A setback line establishes and depicts the required minimum distance from any lot line
and the area within which a use or structure shall exist or can be placed.
2. The front setback line shall extend across the full width of a lot or parcel, and have a
depth which is the distance between the front property line and the closest facade of a
building or structure along a line parallel to the front lot line, excluding those projections
which constitute a legal encroachment into said setback as set forth in this Ordinance.
3. The rear setback line shall extend across the full width of a lot or parcel, and have a depth
which is the distance between the rear property line and the closest facade of a building
or structure along a line parallel to the rear lot line, excluding those projections which
constitute a legal encroachment into said setback as set forth in this Ordinance.

3. When setbacks on a recorded plat are greater or less than those required by this
Ordinance, the setbacks on said plat shall apply. However, if property is rezoned after a
plat has been recorded and the new zoning district has more restrictive setbacks, the more
restrictive setbacks shall apply.
4. Setbacks shown on an approved PUD or TND plan shall control provided the use and/or
development of the subject lot or parcel is in conformance with the use and/or
development depicted on said PUD or TND plan.
5. The architectural front facade of any single family detached or duplex residential
structure shall face the front of a lot or parcel. The architectural front facade of a
structure shall be determined by the Community Development Director based on the
exterior appearance and the interior design and layout of the residence. At a minimum,
the architectural front facade shall include the principal entryway into the residence.
6. Required off-street parking spaces may not be located within the required front yard
setback of any lot, parcel, or building. However, driveways providing access to off-street
parking spaces are not subject to this restriction. Where additional parking is required,
the setback for such parking may be calculated from the right-of-way line in existence
prior to the dedication of any additional right-of-way, provided a minimum setback of 20
feet remains.
7. In a residential district the front yard setback may be reduced to 20 feet if garage access
is from the rear for all lots on one side of a street between two intersecting streets.
8. Within the B2C district, no front yard or side yard is required if abutting lots or parcels
on either side are also zoned B2C. If abutting lots or parcels on either side are not in the
B2C district, a front yard and side yard equal to 80 percent of that required in the abutting
district shall be provided, or as established by the adjoining use and/or structure,
whichever is less.

I. Common Front Yard Setbacks
Where lots on the same side of a street and comprising 50 percent or more of the frontage
between two intersecting streets are developed with buildings having front yards less than the
minimum required, the average front yard of such lots shall determine the minimum front yard
setback required for that frontage. However, in no case shall said average front yard setback be
less than 20 feet or result in a setback greater than that required in the underlying zoning district.

7A.5 Nonconformities
A. Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of
uses, structures, and lots legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance that no
longer conform to the City’s zoning regulations. All such situations are collectively referred to as
“nonconformities.” A nonconformity may also occur as a result of any subsequent rezoning or
amendment to the text of this Ordinance. Any nonconforming use, structure, or lot that lawfully
existed as of the effective date of this Ordinance and that remains nonconforming, and any use,
structure, or lot that becomes nonconforming as a result of any subsequent rezoning or
amendment to the text of this Ordinance, may be continued or maintained only in accordance
with the terms of this Chapter.
B. Determination of Nonconforming Status
In all cases, the burden of establishing that a nonconformity is legal shall rest solely upon the
owner of such nonconformity and not upon the City.
C. Change of Ownership or Tenancy
Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of an existing nonconformity may occur,
however, such nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
E. Damage or Destruction
If a nonconforming use or a structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed to an extent
greater than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, then such use or
structure shall not be re-established unless it is in conformity with the requirements of this
Ordinance.
F. Discontinuance of Use
Except as provided for in this Ordinance, if a nonconforming use is discontinued for one year or
more, then the property shall thereafter be occupied and used only for a conforming use. If a
nonconforming use of property is discontinued, but re-established within less than one year, then
the nonconforming use may continue, if the nature and degree of nonconformity is not changed or
increased from that which existed before it ceased.
G. Change of Use
Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use by securing all approvals and
permits required for the intended or resulting use. No nonconforming use may be changed to
another nonconforming use. The establishment or replacement of residentially used structures on
land zoned for non-residential use shall be prohibited unless a change to an appropriate residential
zoning district is approved by the City Council. The enlargement or expansion of a
nonconforming structure or nonconforming use is not permitted.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.16
H. Continuation, Maintenance, and Minor Repair
The continuation of a nonconforming use and the maintenance or minor repair of a structure
containing a nonconforming use are permitted, provided that the continuation, maintenance, or
minor repair does not expand the nonconforming use or structure. For purposes of this section,
“maintenance or minor repair” shall mean:
? Repairs necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural
soundness or exterior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the
building or structure.
? Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of
surrounding land uses; and
? Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety.
I. Non-conforming Lots of Record
A non-conforming lot of record is a lot designated on a duly recorded subdivision plat or deed or
by other lawful means which has less than the minimum lot area or dimensions prescribed for the
zone in which the lot is located. A non-conforming recorded lot is one which was conforming at
the time it was recorded, but which became non-conforming as a result of changes in the zoning
regulations. A non-conforming recorded lot is subject to the following provisions:
1. Residential Zoning Districts. A non-conforming recorded lot may be used for a
single family dwelling and accessory use provided that required yard setbacks are
provided as established in Table 7A.2 of this Ordinance with the exception that
one side yard be not less than eight (8) feet and the other be ten (10%) percent of
the lot width or a minimum of four (4) feet, whichever is greater. Where an
existing structure occupies a non-conforming lot of record, all yards shall meet at
least seventy (70%) percent of the requirements set forth in Table 7A.2 for the
district in which it is located.
2. Non-Residential Zoning Districts. A non-conforming lot of record may be used
for any principal use and accessory use permitted in the zoning district in which
it is located. Front and rear yards, height restrictions, coverage, and floor area
ratio shall comply with all requirements set forth in Table 7A.2 of this
Ordinance. Side yards (SY) shall be determined as follows:
Actual width (AW) of the lot multiplied by the minimum side
yard (MSY) required in the zoning district in which the lot is
located and dividing this amount by the minimum lot width
(MLW) required in the zoning district in which the lot is located.
SY = (AW x MSY)/MLW
3. No side yard, however need be greater than that required in the zoning district in
which it is located. Also, on a non-conforming corner lot of record, the side yard
abutting a secondary street shall have a setback of no less than twenty (20) feet.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7A.17
J. Adjacent Lots in Single Ownership
If two or more adjacent and vacant nonconforming lots are in single ownership at any time, and
such lots individually have less frontage or area than the minimum requirements of the district in
which they are located, then they shall be considered and treated as a single lot or as several lots
which meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance for the district in which they are
located. Any construction, replacement or enlargement of a single-family dwelling or single
structure permitted by the underlying zoning designation, shall require a recombination of all
necessary lots in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of this section.
K. Enforcement of Requirements
The City may withhold necessary permits, inspections, or other approvals to ensure compliance
with these regulations.
7A.6 Permitted Uses
A. Use Permit
No change shall be made in the use of any building or structure now or hereafter erected or
structurally altered, or in the use of land now or hereafter occupied, without first obtaining a use
permit from the Community Development Director. A use permit shall not be issued unless said
use complies with the provisions of this Ordinance and any amendments thereto.
B. Allowed, Temporary, and Special Use Table
Table 7A.4 lists the uses allowed within specific zoning districts. An “X” indicates that a use is
allowed by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other
applicable regulations of this Ordinance. A “T” indicates that a use is temporary or seasonal and
is subject to the specific regulations and time restrictions established in this Ordinance. An “S”
indicates that a use is allowed subject to issuance of a special use permit and subject to additional
provisions. Special uses require particular consideration in regard to location, relationship to
surrounding uses and zoning districts, and impact upon the planned and orderly development of
neighboring properties and the City. An “A” indicates that a use is accessory to a permitted use.
A blank cell indicates that a use is not allowed in the respective zoning district.
1. Use Standards. The “standards” column of Table 7A.4 contains references to
development standards that apply to the listed use type. These standards are
presented in Chapter 7B.
2. Accessory Uses: An accessory use is subordinate to and located on the same lot
on which the main building or use is situated as established in this Ordinance.
Accessory uses are not indicated on Table 7A.4.

7B.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth standards and criteria which pertain to specific uses.
Because of the potential impact on the City and its residents, these uses require additional
controls in regard to how they exist and relate to other area uses and activities. Unless otherwise
noted, the specific use standards of this section apply to respective use types whether they are
allowed as permitted uses, supplemental uses, special uses, or accessory uses. Additional
standards pertaining to planned unit developments, conservation design developments, and
traditional neighborhood design developments, may be applicable. Use standards may be waived
or varied during the Planned Unit Development (PUD) process or through the City’s zoning
variation process.
Commentary:
In addition to specific performance criteria and standards required by the City for specific uses, many
private developments will have covenants or deed restrictions which apply to parcels within the
development. These are typically enforced by the developer, a property owners association, or a home
owners association. Prior to obtaining a building permit or engaging in any activity requiring City
approval, builders, contractors, and property owners should determine that what they are doing does
not conflict with or otherwise violate the terms and provisions of applicable covenants and restrictions.
It should also be verified that such activity does not require approval from the developer, the property
owners association, or the home owners association.

7B.3 Accessory, Temporary, and Miscellaneous Uses
7B.3.1 Purpose
This section authorizes the establishment of uses that are incidental and customarily subordinate
to principal uses and that complement permitted land uses. The intent in adopting these
regulations is to allow a broad range of accessory uses as long as such uses are located on the
same zoning lot or parcel as the principal use. These regulations are also intended to allow
temporary uses that support principal permitted uses, but which exist for a limited time period.
Both accessory uses and temporary uses are allowed provided they comply with the performance
standards and criteria set forth herein and do not adversely impact surrounding properties.
7B.3.2 Accessory Uses and Structures
A. General Standards

the applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including the use regulations and
the bulk and area standards. The provisions set forth in this section establish
additional requirements and restrictions for particular accessory uses and
structures.
2. Approval of Accessory Uses and Structures. Unless otherwise specified in this
section, an accessory use or structure shall be treated as a permitted use in the
zoning district in which it is located. An accessory use or structure may be
approved in conjunction with approval of the principal use or structure. An
accessory use or structure shall not be constructed or established on any lot or
parcel prior to the issuance of a building permit for the principal structure or the
issuance of an occupancy permit for a principal use to which it is accessory. This
provision shall not, however, prohibit the issuance of a permit for a detached
garage at the time of issuance of a building permit for a principal dwelling unit
on the lot or parcel.

easement without the written approval of the beneficiary of said easement or the
City. If an accessory structure is located within an access, drainage, or utility
easement, it shall be at the property owner’s sole risk and liability and the City
shall not be liable for any damages which may occur as a result of such action.
6. Adequate off-street parking facilities in accordance with the parking standards

Chapter 7D
WIRELESS TOWERS
7D.1 Purpose
7D.2 Definitions
7D.3 General Provisions
7D.1 Purpose
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide specific regulations for the
placement, construction and modification of personal wireless service facilities. The
provisions of this Chapter are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to prohibit the
provision of personal wireless services, nor shall they be applied so as to unreasonably
discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To
the extent that any provision of this Chapter is inconsistent or in conflict with any other
provision of this Ordinance or any ordinance of the City, the provisions of this Chapter
shall control.
B. The purpose of this Chapter is to also establish general guidelines for the siting of
wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this Chapter are to:
1. Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers
and antennas, and to encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas;
2. Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community and encourage
the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than
construction of additional single-use towers;
3. Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them in areas where the
adverse impact on the community is minimal, and to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
4. Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide
such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently;
5. Consider the impact of communications towers on the public health and safety,
and avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
In furtherance of these goals, the City shall give due consideration to the City's
comprehensive planning documents, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
C. When reviewing any request for approval required under this Chapter, the City shall act
within a reasonable period of time after the request is filed, taking into account the nature
and scope of the request. Any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.

persons or property, then upon written notice being provided to the owner of the
tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with
such standards. Failure to achieve such compliance within said 30 days shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s

City for the costs of reviewing the application.
c. The Community Development Director shall review the application for
administrative approval and determine if the proposed use complies with
applicable sections of this Ordinance.
d. The Community Development Director shall respond to each such
application within 120 days after receiving it by either approving or
denying the application. If the Community Development Director fails
to respond to the applicant within said 120 days, then the application
shall be deemed to be approved.
e. In connection with any such administrative approval, the Community
Development Director may, in order to encourage shared use,
administratively waive any zoning district setback requirements in
Section 7D.3.H.2.d or separation distances between towers in Section
7D.3.H.2.e by up to 50 percent.
f. In connection with any administrative approval, the Community
Development Director may, in order to encourage the use of monopoles,
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7D. 6
administratively allow the reconstruction of an existing tower to
monopole construction.
g. If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant shall file an
application for a special use permit prior to filing any appeal that may be
available under this Ordinance.
2. List of Administratively Approved Uses. The following uses may be approved
by the Community Development Director after administrative review:
a. Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said
tower or antenna, in any manufacturing district.
b. Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with the
terms of these regulations.
1) Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna not attached to a tower
may be approved by the Community Development Director as an
accessory use to any commercial, industrial, professional,
institutional, or multi-family structure of eight or more dwelling
units, provided the (a) the antenna does not extend more than 30 feet
above the highest point of the structure, (b) it complies with all
applicable FCC and FAA regulations, and (c) and it complies with
all applicable building codes.
2) Antennas on existing towers. An antenna attached to an existing
tower may be approved by the Community Development Director.
To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation
and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one
carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction
of new towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a
manner consistent with the following:
(a) A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower
type as the existing tower, unless the Community Development
Director allows reconstruction as a monopole.
(b) Height. An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller
height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height, to
accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna. The
change in height referred to in this Section and herein may only
occur one time per communication tower. The additional height
referred to in this Section herein shall not require an additional
distance separation as set forth in herein. The tower's premodification
height shall be used to calculate such distance
separations.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7D. 7
(c) Onsite location. A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite
within 50 feet of its existing location. After the tower is rebuilt
to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on the
site. A relocated onsite tower shall continue to be measured
from the original tower location for purposes of calculating
separation distances between towers. The relocation of a tower
shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of these
regulations. The onsite relocation of a tower which comes
within the separation distances to residential units or
residentially zoned lands as established herein shall only be
permitted when approved by the Community Development
Director.
H. Special Use Permits
1. General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special use
permits for towers or antennas by the City Council:
a. If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under these regulations or
allowed to be approved administratively, then a special use permit shall
be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an
antenna in all zoning districts.
b. Applications for special use permits under this Chapter shall be subject
to the procedures and requirements of this Ordinance, except as modified
herein.
c. In granting a special use permit, the City Council may impose conditions
which it believes are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the
proposed tower on adjoining properties.
d. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits,
whether civil, mechanical or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed
professional engineer.
e. An applicant for a special use permit shall submit the applicable
information described herein and a non-refundable fee established by the
City Council to reimburse the City for the costs of reviewing the
application.
2. Towers

b. Factors Considered in Granting Special Use Permits for Towers. In
addition to any standards for consideration of special use permit
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7D. 9
applications pursuant to this Ordinance, the Plan Commission and City
Council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to
issue a special use permit. The City Council may, however, waive or
reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if it is
concluded that the goals of this Chapter better served thereby:
1) Height of the proposed tower and its proximity to residential
structures and residential district boundaries;
2) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
3) Surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage, and natural
features;
4) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
5) Proposed ingress and egress; and
6) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures,
as discussed herein.
c. Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures or Alternative
Technology. A new tower shall not be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the City Council that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require
the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna. An applicant shall submit information related to the availability
of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology.
Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna may consist of any of the following:
1) No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area which meets the applicant's engineering requirements.
2) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant's engineering requirements.
3) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment.
4) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or
the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7D. 10
5) The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding
new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
6) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that
render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
7) The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable micro cell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached
to a wire line system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology
that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be
presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
d. Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers
for which a special use permit is required; however, the City Council
may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this Chapter
are better served:
1) Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75 percent of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot or property line.
2) Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
3) Towers located in the M-1 Light Manufacturing zoning district and
the M-2 Heavy Manufacturing zoning district that abut a state
highway must be set back a distance equal to at least 50 percent of
the height of the tower from the state highway.
e. Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required, however,
the City Council may reduce the standard separation requirements if the
goals of this Chapter are better served.
1) Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
(a) Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot or property line of the off-site uses and/or designated
areas as specified or otherwise provided for in Table 7D.1.
(b) Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 7D.1.
2) Separation distances between towers. Separation distances between
towers shall apply to and be measured between the proposed tower
and pre-existing towers. Separation distances shall be measured by
drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7D. 11
tower and the base of the proposed tower. Separation distances
listed in linear feet shall be as shown in Table 7D.2.
f. Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less
than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anti-climbing device. The City Council may, however, waive such
requirements, as it deems appropriate.
g. Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required..
1) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a plant material buffer that
screens the view of the tower compound from property used or zoned
for residential purposes. At a minimum, the buffer shall consist of a
landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the
compound. In locations where the visual impact of the tower will be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced by the
Community Development Director.
2) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall
be preserved to the greatest extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, existing natural growth around
the perimeter of the property may be a sufficient buffer.
3) Landscaping plans shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department for required review and approval prior to
the issuance of a required building permit.

permit and typical maintenance activities, as well as the renovation and/or interior remodeling of
existing structures, are excluded from the provisions of these regulations.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 2
7E.2.3 Area, Bulk, Density, and Setback Regulations
Criteria regarding area, bulk, density, and setback requirements shall be those set forth in Table
7A.2 of this Ordinance, except that the front yard setback on IL Route 47, from US Route 14
south to the City limits and from Ware Road north to the City limits, shall be 90 feet measured
from the centerline of IL Route 47.
7E.2.4 Land Use Permitted land uses are those allowed in the underlying zoning district
or as otherwise provided for in this Ordinance. A mix of residential and non-residential land use
is encouraged within the IL Route 47 Overlay District, subject to the following:
A. Residential Land Uses. If existing single-family-detached or single-family-attached
residential properties are proposed for non-residential or multiple-family uses,
consolidation of such properties into a single zoning lot for purposes of shared access
shall occur where possible in order to reduce or minimize the number of curb cuts.
Residential dwellings on a ground floor are discouraged within the IL Route 47 Overlay
District. Dwelling units may be established above the ground floor of any principal
structure in the IL Route 47 Overlay District, including those on land zoned for
non-residential use, subject to the area and bulk requirements set forth in Table 7A.2 of
this Ordinance and applicable provisions of the City's building codes.
B. Non-residential Land Uses. Retail and service uses are preferred land uses and are
encouraged within the IL Route 47 Overlay District. Although the predominant land use
on the west side of Route 47 between IL Route 120 and Melody Lane is residential, if
zoning and/or land use changes are proposed business uses and professional offices are
preferred.
7E.2.5 Layout and Design Standards
A. Prior to issuance of building permits for new development activity along IL Route 47,
exterior facade design plans shall be submitted to the Community Development
Department for review and approval. Where applicable, site plans shall also be submitted
to the Community Development Department for review and approval.
B. Off-site improvements, including but not limited to pavement striping, traffic
signalization, and directional signage can and may be required. Turning entrance lanes
and acceleration/deceleration lanes are required for non-residential, multifamily, and
mixed use developments unless the City Engineer determines they are unnecessary. The
dedication of additional right-of-way may be required to allow for roadway widening.
Where applicable, Illinois Department of Transportation approval shall be obtained.
C. Where physically possible, adjacent business properties shall provide cross access drives
and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites. Easements shall be dedicated to
allow cross access driving lanes and/or frontage drives generally parallel to IL Route 47
for the purpose of providing cross access to and from existing and/or future parking areas
on adjoining parcels. Such easements shall be recorded prior to the issuance of any
building permits and driveways shall be designed, located, and constructed to take into
account future access to adjoining property.
D. Curb Cut Access and Entrance Requirements
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 3
1. Curb cuts along opposite sides of IL Route 47 are encouraged to be located
opposite one another to the greatest extent physically possible or to be maintained with an
offset that complies with applicable City and Illinois Department of Transportation
standards.
2. Where practical, a curb cut shall provide common access to abutting properties.
Location of curb cuts and site access shall be based in part on the ability to provide such
common access. Easements shall be provided to allow common usage of curb cuts and
access drives, and such easements shall be provided and recorded prior to the issuance of
any building permits for a site.
3. The number of curb cuts for any parcel or lot shall be the minimum necessary to
provide site access. This number shall be determined by the City Engineer and shall
require the concurrence of the Illinois Department of Transportation.
4. Curb cuts and driveway approaches shall not be located within acceleration or
deceleration lanes, and shall be designed to provide exiting vehicles with unobstructed
views.
5. Driveway approaches shall not be greater in width, measured at the lot line, than
thirty-six (36) feet for business uses and twenty-five (25) feet for residential uses, or as
required by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Curb cuts and driveway
approaches which are restricted to “one-way traffic” or “right-in, right-out” movement
may be exempted from this requirement by the Community Development Director.
(Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
6. The driveway specifications and length shall be designed to provide adequate
stacking capacity for both entering and exiting vehicles, to prevent vehicles from backing
into the flow of traffic on a public street, and to avoid causing conflicts with on-site
circulation.
7. Where side road frontage is available and access is physically practical, site
access shall occur via collector streets or side roads, in order to lessen and reduce the
number of direct access points onto IL Route 47. Such access shall be the maximum
distance possible from IL Route 47, with a preferred distance of at least 150 feet.
E. Off-street Parking Requirements
1. Except as herein stated, the minimum number of required off-street parking
spaces shall be that which is required by this Ordinance.
2. Off-street parking areas for non-residential, multiple family and mixed-use
developments shall be improved with curb and gutter, and paved with a hard, dust-free,
surface material. These requirements may be amended by the City Engineer based upon
alternative design factors and demonstrated need.

7E.4 Adaptive Reuse Overlay District
The adaptive reuse overlay district may exist in all zoning districts. School buildings, public
buildings, hospitals, churches, and other similar uses which are located within existing residential
neighborhoods may no longer be suitable for their intended public use as circumstances change.
Because the use of these buildings is unique and different from other special uses, the adaptive
reuse overlay district provides specific regulations allowing for the reuse activity intended to
promote the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and convenience, by insuring that such uses
are compatible with their surroundings.
7E.4.1 Procedures for Adaptive Reuse Overlay District
The adaptive reuse overlay district shall be established as a special use. Application for an
adaptive reuse overlay district shall be made to the City and shall be accompanied by all required
plans and documents. Additional information may be required by the Community Development
Director in order to verify that the proposed overlay district meets applicable requirements and
standards set forth in this Ordinance.
A. A special use permit approved for an adaptive reuse overlay district shall not become
effective until approved in accordance with the procedures of this Section and until the
ordinance approving the overlay district special use is recorded in the Office of the
McHenry County Recorder. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
B. The adaptive reuse overlay district is intended to be attached to existing zoning districts
as an overlay special use. Where such an overlay district involves the subdivision and
platting of land, compliance with the subdivision review and approval procedures set
forth in this Ordinance is required. As part of the overlay district approval process,
variances and waivers of the requirements otherwise set forth in this Ordinance may be
granted without having to proceed through a separate variation or waiver approval
process.
C. Items necessary in order to apply for a special use for an adaptive reuse overlay district,
shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. A detailed site plan showing the intended reuse.
2. A detailed landscape plan.
3. An explanation of how the reuse of the site is compatible with the ordinances and
comprehensive planning documents of the City.
4. The intended uses of the site and the parking calculations for these uses.
7E.4.2 Adaptive Reuse Overlay District Uses
A. Uses within the special use overlay district may include, but are not limited to, the
following:

Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 12
7E.5 Traditional Neighborhood Overlay District
7E.5.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) Overlay District is to establish
standards and procedures to guide new development and redevelopment in a manner consistent
with the historic character and development pattern of the existing City, while providing an
alternative to typical suburban-style development patterns. A TND:
 Has a higher overall residential and
commercial density than conventional
projects of the same acreage.
 Provides for a mix of uses, including
residential, commercial, and civic uses.
 Incorporates a system of narrower,
interconnected streets with sidewalks
and bikeways that offer multiple routes
for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists
and provides for the connection of those
streets to existing and new development.
 Provides for a mix of housing types and
sizes to accommodate households of all
ages, sizes, and incomes.
 Retains existing buildings with
historical features or other features that
define the character of the community.
 Replicates the size, scale and mass of
existing buildings and structures in the
older parts of the City.
 Provides for a more efficient use of land
and infrastructure.
 Implements the City’s adopted
comprehensive planning documents.
7E.5.2 Procedures for Traditional Neighborhood Development Approval
A. TND Approval. A TND shall be reviewed and approved as a Planned Unit Development.
Application TND approval shall be made to the City and shall be accompanied by all
required plans and documents. Additional information may be required by the
Community Development Director in order to verify that the proposed TND meets
applicable requirements and standards set forth in this Ordinance.
Commentary:
Traditional neighborhoods typically result in certain social objectives, which may include the
following:
 By bringing within walking distance most of the activities of daily living, the elderly and the young
gain independence of movement.
 By reducing the number and length of automobile trips, traffic congestion is reduced and road
construction in minimized.
 By organizing appropriate building densities, public transit becomes a viable alternative to the
automobile.
 By providing a full range of housing types and work places, age and economic class are
integrated and the bonds of an authentic community are formed.
 By providing suitable civic buildings, community-wide initiatives are encouraged and
supported.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 13
B. TND and Zoning Changes. Any zoning change approved for a TND shall not be
effective until approved in accordance with the procedures of this Section and until the
ordinance approving the TND is recorded in the Office of the McHenry County Recorder.
It is the intent of this Ordinance that the physical development or redevelopment of a
TND not occur until after a final plat document has been reviewed and approved in
conformance with the requirements of this section and/or applicable portions of this
Ordinance.
C. The TND designation is intended to be attached to existing zoning districts as an overlay
designation. As part of the TND approval process, variances and waivers of the
requirements otherwise set forth in this Ordinance may be granted without having to
proceed through a separate variation or waiver approval process.
7E.5.3 Permitted Uses
The TND may depart from strict conformity with the density, design, dimension, area, height,
bulk, use, and other regulations set forth in these regulations, as long as said departures are
included as part of the approved TND documents. The uses permitted in a TND shall be
governed by the permitted uses in the underlying zoning district, the uses set forth in the
ordinance approving the TND or the materials included as part of the documentation comprising
the approved TND final plat.
7E.5.4 Traditional Neighborhood Development Design Standards
A. A TND should have the following features:
1. A neighborhood with a discernible center, or focal point, such as a square or green,
and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner.
Commentary:
Traditional neighborhoods are compact, characterized by a diverse mix of uses, are
pedestrian friendly, and are intended to ensure the following:
• The neighborhood is limited in area to that which can be traversed in a tenminute
walk.
• Residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings are located in close
proximity to each other.
• A hierarchy of streets which serve the needs of the pedestrian and automobile
equitably.
• Physically defined squares and parks provide places available for formal social
activity and recreation.
• Private buildings form a clear edge, defining the street space.
• Civic buildings reinforce the identity of the neighborhood, providing places of
assembly for social, cultural and religious activities.
2. Most of the dwellings within a five-minute walk (averaging 1,800 feet) of the
neighborhood center.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 14
3. A variety of available dwelling types, including detached and attached single family
homes, rowhouses, apartments, so that a diverse population may live in the same
neighborhood.
4. Shops and offices at the edge of the neighborhood, and of sufficient variety to
provide for a household’s weekly needs.
5. Elementary schools located so that most children can walk from their homes.
6. Streets within the neighborhood forming an inter-connected network, and dispersing
traffic by providing pedestrians and motor vehicles a variety of routes to any
destination.
7. Relatively narrow streets sized according to traffic demands of the uses facing the
street, and shaded by rows of shade trees.
8. Buildings in the neighborhood center placed close to the street, creating well-defined
outdoor space.
9. Garages and parking lots rarely facing the street, with parking relegated to the rear of
buildings and usually accessed by alleys.
10. Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood
center reserved for civic buildings, which can be used for education, religious, and
cultural activities.
B. Permitted uses in a TND may consist of the following:
1. A range of residential uses, including:
 Single-family detached
dwellings.
 Single-family attached
dwellings, including
duplexes, townhouses, and
row houses.
 Multifamily dwellings,
including senior housing.
 For infill development, the
range of residential uses
may be satisfied by existing
residential uses.
 Residential units on upper
floors above commercial
uses or to the rear of
storefronts.
2. Commercial areas, within a walking distance of approximately 10 to 15 minutes
or ½ to ¾ mile (existing commercial areas within a distance of a 15-minute walk
or 3/4 mile may satisfy this requirement), including:

area. Existing civic or institutional uses within a 15-minute walk or a distance of
3/4 mile may satisfy the requirement for civic or institutional uses.
 Open space uses, such as a central square, parks, playgrounds, greenways, natural
areas, and outdoor recreation areas. Large outdoor recreation areas should be at
the periphery of neighborhoods rather than at central locations.
7E.5.5 Density Standards
The density or number of permitted dwelling units in a TND may be greater than that allowed
prior to the change to a TND. The maximum density or number of dwelling units allowed by the
underlying zoning shall be adjusted upward as a bonus awarded for furthering certain public
objectives, as set forth in Section 7E.5.5.B herein.
A. Conditions for calculating residential densities
1. Areas used for nonresidential purposes shall not be counted towards the calculation
of overall density or allowable number of dwelling units in a TND.
2. All dwelling units constructed above or at the rear of commercial uses are allowed in
addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this section. However, the
total number of such additional dwelling units shall not be increased by more than 10
percent of the base residential density.
B. Residential density bonuses
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 16
1. The base residential density in a TND shall be 20 percent higher than the maximum
residential density for a conventional development in accordance with the underlying
zoning district.
2. An increase in density or in the number of allowable dwelling units is permitted
where the TND provides housing for low or moderate income households. For each
affordable dwelling unit provided under this section, one additional dwelling unit
shall be permitted, up to a maximum 10 percent increase in dwelling units.
C. Commercial density
The commercial density of a TND shall range from a minimum of 125 square feet of commercial
floor area per residential dwelling unit to a maximum of 300 square feet of commercial floor area
per residential dwelling unit. This shall include retail, food service, office and service uses. The
commercial component shall be constructed prior to the commencement of construction of the
final 25 percent of the dwellings in the TND.
7E.5.6 Lot Standards
A variety of lot sizes and types shall be provided to facilitate housing diversity and choice and to
meet the needs of people with different housing needs.
A. Lot Diversity. Lot layouts should provide for blocks that are generally in the range of 200
to 400 feet deep by 600 to 800 feet long. Perimeter lots should be similar in size to those on land
adjacent to the TND.
B. Street plane. A single street plane should be formed by designing or improving adjacent
buildings and lots with uniform setbacks and evenly spaced buildings, however, projections or
recesses from the front façade are allowed.
C. Lot widths. Lot widths should be similar to those of surrounding sites.
D. Front Setback for Mixed or Nonresidential Uses. Civic and commercial buildings have no
minimum setback, but should be aligned with existing adjacent development where possible, or
with similar setback distances for historically significant buildings in the older parts of the City.
E. Front Setback for Residential Uses. For infill and where possible with new (contiguous)
development, front setbacks for new housing should be established that respond to existing
setbacks on either side of and/or across the street from the new development. Setbacks shall not
differ more than 5 feet from adjacent setbacks.
F. Side Setbacks. Provision for zero lot-line single-family dwellings may be permitted,
provided a reciprocal access easement is recorded for both lots and that attached dwellings have
pedestrian access to the rear yard by means other than through the principal structure.
7E.5.7 Project Review and Engineering
A. Architectural Standards. A variety of architectural features and building materials shall
be used to give each building or group of buildings a distinct character.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 17
B. Standards for Existing Structures
 Existing structures, if historic or architecturally significant, shall be protected from
demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape development.
 The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings shall be
used as the criteria for renovating historic or architecturally significant structures.
C. Standards for New Structures
 Size, Scale and Mass. New structures within a TND shall be no more than 2 and ½
stories for single-family residential uses, or four stories for commercial, multi-family, or
mixed uses. New structures within a TND shall be similar in size, scale and mass to
existing structures constructed prior to 1945.
 Architectural Style. The architectural style of a building shall be continued in all of its
major features on all sides visible from a public street. If new structures for retail or
other commercial uses exceed an individual footprint of 5,000 square feet, then the
facades of such buildings shall be designed to appear as multiple buildings.
 New structures may be constructed in any architectural style but incorporating elements
of the mid-western vernacular is strongly encouraged. However, if such structures are
built using elements and forms of Victorian, Craftsman/Bungalow, Prairie School or
colonial revival style, such elements shall be based upon an architectural inventory of the
existing structures in the region. Stylistic details characteristic of other regions of the
United States are discouraged.
 Entries and Facades. The front facade of the principal building on any lot in a TND shall
face onto a public street and shall not be oriented to face directly toward a parking lot.
Porches, pent roofs, roof overhangs, hooded front doors or other architectural elements
shall define the front entrance to all residences. For commercial buildings, a minimum of
30-percent of the front facade on the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting of
windows or door openings allowing views into and out of the interior. For retail
buildings, a minimum of 40-percent of the front facade on the ground floor shall be
transparent, consisting of windows or door openings allowing views into and out of the
interior.

 Landscaping and Screening Standards. Overall composition and location of landscaped
areas, including screening and buffering features, shall comply with the approved
landscape standards of the City and shall complement the scale of the development and
its surroundings.
7E.5.8 Circulation
The circulation system shall be used to organize and define the community, acting as functional
and visual links between neighborhoods, the TND center, civic and commercial areas and open
space. The circulation system shall be interconnected both internally and to existing development
in order to achieve adequate traffic capacity, connected pedestrian and bicycle routes, controlled
through traffic, limited lot access to streets intended for higher traffic volumes, and safe and
efficient mobility through the community.
A. General Street Design. Traffic calming features such as curb extensions, traffic circles,
and medians may be used to encourage slow traffic speeds.
B. Pedestrian Circulation. Pedestrian circulation systems that minimize conflicts with
automobiles shall be provided throughout all development sites that consist of more than one
building, and shall connect all buildings to public sidewalks. Where feasible, existing pedestrian
routes through the site shall be preserved and enhanced.
 Walkways in residential uses. Clear and well-lighted walkways, 4 to 5 feet in width
depending on anticipated pedestrian traffic, shall connect entrances into multifamily
dwellings with adjacent public sidewalk and parking areas on the site.
 Walkways in civic, mixed and nonresidential uses. Clear and well-lighted walkways shall
connect building entrances with adjacent public sidewalk and to parking areas on the site.
Such walkways shall be a minimum of 5 feet in width, and shall be landscaped where
feasible with trees, shrubs and other plant material.
 Transit access. Where transit service is planned, pleasant and convenient access to transit
stops shall be provided. Future transit stops should be depicted.
 Crosswalks. Intersections of pedestrian paths with streets shall be designed with clearly
defined edges and may include walk-outs or similar design features. Crosswalks shall be
well lit and defined with contrasting paving materials or striping.
C. Bicycle Circulation. Convenient bicycle circulation systems that minimize conflicts with
automobiles and pedestrians shall be provided throughout all development sites that include new
or improved streets. Where feasible, existing bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved
and enhanced.
D. Motor Vehicle Circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be designed to minimize
conflicts with pedestrian access and circulation, as well as with surrounding residential uses.
 Existing street grid. Site designs should maintain the existing street grid, where present,
and restore any disrupted street grid where feasible.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 20
 Service vehicles. Service vehicle access shall be provided so as not to conflict with
pedestrian use. Access points for service vehicles should provide as direct a route as
possible to service and loading dock areas, while avoiding movement through parking
areas.
 Snow removal. Site design shall include areas for snow storage unless an acceptable
snow removal plan is provided.
 Impervious surfaces. Reduction of impervious surfaces through the use of interlocking
pavers or similar means is encouraged for areas that serve low-impact parking needs,
such as remote parking lots, parking areas for periodic uses and parking in natural
amenity areas.
E. Street Configuration.
 In order to limit and slow through traffic, local streets with narrower roadways, shorter
lengths, and other geometric configurations are encouraged. No lot shall be more than
1,200 feet from a street intersection.
 Intersections shall be at a 90 degree or right angle whenever possible, but in no case less
than 75 degrees. Low volume streets are encouraged to be aligned to form three-way
intersections creating an inherent right-of-way assignment (the through street receives
precedence) in order to reduce accidents without the use of traffic controls. A low volume
street that intersects with a higher-order street, such as a collector, is encouraged to be
aligned with another street to form a four-way intersection, which can easily be regulated
by a stop sign or other traffic control device.
 The orientation of streets and pedestrian access should enhance the visibility of open
spaces and prominent buildings, and provide for the maximum number of lots with
southern exposure. All streets shall terminate at other streets or at public land, except as
specified below.
 Streets and access lanes that terminate in cul-de-sacs may be permitted only when
topography prevents the use of loop streets.
 Local streets may terminate in stub streets with temporary turn-arounds when such streets
act as connections to future phases of the development.
 Curb cuts for driveways to individual residential lots shall be prohibited along arterial
streets. Curb cuts shall be limited to intersections with other streets or access drives to
parking areas for commercial, civic or multifamily uses.
7E.5.9. Street Classification Standards
Each street within a TND shall be classified as follows in order to establish its design criteria and
traffic carrying capacity. Such design criteria is set forth in Table 7E.1:
A. Medium-Volume Commercial Street. This street is designed for a mixed-use City center
or neighborhood commercial center. The primary function is access to commercial or mixed-use
buildings, but it is also part of the major street network. On-street parking, whether diagonal or
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 7E. 21
parallel, helps to slow traffic and facilitate pedestrian traffic. Additional parking is provided in
public and/or private lots to the side or rear of buildings, and alleys may be used for deliveries
and alternate access.
B. Medium-Volume Residential Street (or Subcollector). This street is designed for primary
access to individual residential properties, to connect streets of lower and higher function, and to
access the major street network. The design speed shall be 25 miles per hour.
C. Low-Volume Residential Street. This street is designed for primary access to individual
residential properties as well as access to adjacent streets. Traffic volumes are relatively low, with
a design speed of 25 mph.
D. Residential Access Lane. This street is designed for primary access to a limited number
of residential properties. With minimal traffic volumes, traffic is completely subservient to the
residential environment. Access lanes can be constructed as cul-de-sacs, loop street, or short
connecting streets, and generally serve 25 or fewer homes. Bicycle and pedestrian connections
shall be provided from cul-de-sac bulbs.
E. Alley. These streets provide secondary access to residential properties where street
frontages are narrow, where the street is designed with a narrow width to provide limited
on-street parking, or where alley access development is desired to increase residential densities.
Alleys may also be used to provide delivery access or alternate parking access to commercial
properties.
7E.5.10 Ownership and Maintenance of Public Spaces Provision shall be made for the
ownership and maintenance of streets, squares, parks, open space, and other public spaces in a
TND by dedication to the City, or to an entity of the City’ choosing, including but not limited to a
home-owners or property-owners association, a private not-for-profit conservation organization,
or a combination thereof.
7E.5.11 Failure to Initiate Construction After Approval
A. Approval of a TND shall be valid for no more than three (3) years from the date of
approval unless within such time period construction of required infrastructure has commenced or
issuance of a building permit has been obtained and construction of a building foundation has
started.
B. The time-frame stated herein may be extended for up to one (1) year by the Community
Development Director if an extension request is filed with the City prior to the expiration of the
approved TND. Any additional extensions of an approved TND may be granted by the City
Council for a time period of up to one (1) year upon written request of the applicant.
C. At such time that the validity of an approved TND lapses, all uses, terms, and conditions
set forth in said TND shall be declared null and void.

DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS
8A.1 Site Development and Design Standards
8A.1.1 Lot and Block Standards
8A.1.2 Street and Sidewalk Standards
8A.1.3 Tree Standards
8A.1.4 Street Lighting
8A.1.5 Sanitary Sewer Collection System
8A.1.6 Storm Water Management
8A.1.7 Potable Water System
8A.1 Site Development and Design Standards
The purpose of good development and design standards is to create functional and attractive
subdivision/PUD development, to minimize adverse impacts upon the community and
environment, and to ensure that a proposed development can be served by public and private
utilities and by City services. The design of each project should address the natural and built
features of a site and the proposed use of the land. No land should be developed which because
of flooding, poor drainage and soils, severe topography or other conditions is considered to be
harmful to the public health, safety, or general welfare, unless such conditions can be
satisfactorily addressed and resolved.
The mass grading of development sites is discouraged and is limited to between 20 and 40 acres
at any one time. Large developments shall stabilize areas of up to 40 acres that are graded before
proceeding with subsequent grading activity. Areas of the site that have been rough-graded, but
will not be subject to immediate building and development activity shall be seeded to lessen
wind, soil, and water erosion.
Buffers installed to protect natural resources and amenities, or buffers which are located in close
proximity to or abut such natural resources and amenities, shall be planted and stabilized prior to
the start of grading activity.
8A.1.1 Lot and Block Standards
A. All lots shall be arranged to provide satisfactory building sites which are properly related
to topography and surrounding land uses. Lots shall be laid out in an efficient and uniform
manner to avoid the creation of odd shaped lots and unusable remnants of land.
B. Lot dimensions, frontage area, and building setbacks must conform to the standards of
this Ordinance, or with McHenry County Zoning Ordinance standards for unincorporated land
within one and one-half (1 and ½) miles of the City limits.
C. When practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to
curved street lines, except where an exception to this provision will result in a better street and lot
layout.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.2
D. Lots shall not block any street extensions depicted in Woodstock’s comprehensive
planning documents.
E. All lots shall front on a publicly dedicated street or, if approved by the City Council, on a
private street or drive established by a dedicated access easement. Such an easement shall have a
minimum width of twenty-eight (28) feet and shall not be used for parking purposes.
F. Double frontage or reverse frontage lots are prohibited except where lots back onto a
major street, in which case such lots shall have an additional depth and an additional rear yard
setback of at least twenty (20) feet. This additional depth shall be landscaped and bermed in
order to provide a buffer between street activity and the rear of the lot. Access to a double
frontage or reverse frontage lot shall be from a minor or secondary street and not from a major
street.
G. The width of irregularly shaped lots shall be measured along a line drawn parallel to the
front lot line at a distance from the front lot line equal to the required front yard setback. In the
case of a curved front lot line, the lot width shall be measured as the length of the arc, which is
parallel to the front lot line at the building setback.
H. Corner lots at intersecting streets must be of sufficient area and width to accommodate
the building setbacks required on both of the intersecting streets. Lots containing water courses,
drainage ways, utility easements, or similar restrictions shall be designed to have adequate
building area and to meet building setbacks.
I. Flag lots are prohibited.
J. The maximum length of blocks shall be 1,200 feet except as provided for herein and
where the Plan Commission determines that a greater length is required in order to avoid or
reduce a traffic hazard or to avoid encroachment or disturbance of a significant natural resource.
Blocks greater than 1,200 feet in length shall provide a twenty (20) foot wide pedestrian crossway
easement through the approximate center of the block. Pedestrian crossway locations should take
into account topography, drainage, and similar physical features on a site. The pedestrian
crossway shall have a six (6) foot wide paved surface, shall be a required public improvement,
and shall be centered within said easement.
K. Blocks within subdivisions zoned for business and industrial activity shall be adequate to
provide for the use intended and to comply with the standards for such lots as set forth in this
Ordinance.
L. Lots and blocks adjacent to railroad right-of-way shall be designed to minimize access
from said lots and blocks to the railroad the right-of-way. Fencing or similar protection shall be
provided between a residentially zoned subdivision and the railroad right-of-way.
8A.1.2 Street and Sidewalk Standards
A. Streets shall be located and designed to permit the safe, efficient, and orderly movement
of traffic; to be easily maintained; to meet current and future needs of the population; and to
present an attractive streetscape. Street improvements shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the specifications of the City.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.3
B. The design and layout of collector and arterial streets shall take into account and conform
to the comprehensive planning documents and planning policies of the City. Where a subdivision
contains the location of a major street recommended by the comprehensive planning documents,
such a street shall be provided.
C. At street intersections, corners shall be rounded with a radius sufficient to provide the
right-of-way necessary to accommodate sidewalks, traffic control facilities, utilities, and other
essential necessary improvements without encroaching onto the corner lots.
D. When land is subdivided into large lots, such lots shall be arranged and laid out to permit
the logical location and opening of future streets and the resubdivision of said lots.
E. All subdivisions/PUDs, where practical, shall be accessible from at least two publicly
dedicated streets. Half streets are not permitted.
F. Lots abutting major streets, including arterials and collectors, shall be located so as not
have direct access to and from said streets unless approved by the City.
G. Minor streets shall be designed so that high-volume through traffic is discouraged, while
safe connections to major streets, including arterials and collectors, are provided.
H. Existing streets terminating at the boundary of a proposed subdivision/PUD shall be
extended into the subdivision/PUD and be incorporated into the street pattern.
I. Streets which are or will become extensions of existing streets shall have the same name
as the existing street. New street names shall not be the same as or similar to names of existing
streets. Proposed street names shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval.
J. Streets which are extensions of existing streets shall have their centerlines and grades in
alignment with such existing streets.
K. Clear visibility from the centerline intersection of streets shall be provided for at least
three-hundred feet on major residential streets and streets in commercial and industrial
subdivisions/PUDs, and two-hundred feet on minor residential streets.
L. Streets that connect to other streets, or looped streets, are preferable for the provision of
emergency services, maintenance, and circulation. Cul-de-sac streets are discouraged and are
permitted only when topographic, physical, or similar site conditions make alternative provisions
impractical. When permitted, the length of a cul-de-sac street shall not be greater than eight
hundred feet. Cul-de-sac length shall be measured along the street centerline from the point of
intersection to the center of the cul-de-sac. An increase in permitted length may be approved if
additional access is not possible or practical, and if such increase does not jeopardize public
health and safety.
M. Dead-end streets are prohibited except where a street is intended to extend beyond the
perimeter of the subdivision/PUD or to provide access to adjoining undeveloped land, in which
case a temporary turning area may be required.
N. Streets both within and abutting a subdivision/PUD shall be fully improved in
compliance with the public improvement details and standards established by the City Engineer.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.4
O. When any subdivision/PUD or any part of a subdivision/PUD is adjacent to only one side
of an existing right-of-way whose width is less than the minimum right-of-way width required
herein, the developer shall dedicate such additional right-of-way as may be required to meet the
minimum right-of-way width requirements unless waived by the City Council.
P. Curbs and gutters are required unless waived by the City Council. The use of shoulders
and vegetated swales in lieu of curbs and gutters may be approved by the City Council in order to
achieve the goals of conservation design and more efficient storm water management, and to
achieve improved groundwater protection and quality.
Q. Sidewalks are required along all interior streets and along all street frontage abutting the
development site, unless it is determined by the City Engineer that they can not be physically
installed. In such a case, the City Engineer may (a) authorize the installation of an equal sidewalk
improvement at another location determined by the City or (b) may allow the developer to
contribute funds in an amount equal to the cost of installing said sidewalks, which funds shall be
used by the City to install other sidewalk amenities at other locations in the City. The use of
pedestrian paths in lieu of sidewalks may be approved by the City Council provided such
alternative paths provide a convenient pedestrian route and are available for use by the public.
R. Sidewalks shall have a minimum width of four (4) feet, a thickness of at least four (4)
inches except when situated within a driveway, wherein the thickness shall be six (6) inches, and
shall extend a distance of at least one (1) foot into the right-of-way. Sidewalks in commercial and
industrial business areas shall be at least six (6) feet wide and may abut the curb.
S. Streets outside the City shall meet applicable County and/or Township road standards.
T. Access to all lots and property must be provided by either a dedicated public street or, if
approved by the City Council, a private street or drive located within a dedicated public access
easement having a minimum width of thirty (30) feet. The creation of private streets or private
drives may be considered based on site suitability and provided a binding easement described on
a final plat or other recorded document shall assure the continued existence and maintenance of
said private street or private drive.
U. Minimum public street surface width, measured from back of curb to back of curb, is as
follows (these are minimum widths and changes may be required based on projected trips and the
area and/or population being served):
Major residential street 37 feet or 31 feet if on-street parking is limited to one
side of the street
Minor residential street 31 feet or 28 feet if on-street parking is limited to one
side of the street
Business street 37 feet or 31 feet if on-street parking is limited to one
side of the street
Cul-de-sacs 100 foot diameter
V. Minimum public street right-of-way width is as follows (these are minimum widths and
changes may be required based on projected trips and the area and/or population being served):
Major residential street 60 feet
Minor residential street 60 feet
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.5
Business street 66 feet
Frontage road 50 feet
Cul-de-sacs 130 foot diameter
W. Street jogs and intersections with centerline offsets of less than one-hundred-fifty feet are
prohibited.
X. Streets shall be designed to intersect at right angles whenever possible and two (2) streets
shall not intersect at an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees.
Y. Frontage road improvements are required where the proposed development will
significantly affect traffic flow and volumes.
AA. Approval of a final plat showing publicly dedicated street right-of-way does not
constitute acceptance of street improvements by the City.
Z. Upon completion of required curbs, gutters, and street base/binder course, fine grading
and seeding/sodding improvements shall be installed over the unimproved portion of the public
street right-of-way abutting the back of each curb.
AA. The bituminous binder course shall be ramped up to meet the top of the gutter flag and
the top of all utility structures, such as sanitary sewer manholes, storm sewer inlets, valve vaults,
and similar improvements. The binder course shall be ground off around the utility structures and
around the gutter flag prior to placement of the final surface course.
BB. Where it is desirable and appropriate to provide for public street access to adjoining land,
the proposed street right-of-way shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such land.
CC. Where deemed necessary to provide adequate protection of residential properties, to
afford separation of through and local streets, or where alternative traffic movement and routes
are desirable, the City Council may require that access streets be installed to service areas
fronting on major streets.
DD. Boulevards and center islands shall not be installed within a public street right-of-way or
cul-de-sac unless approved by the City Council and provided a binding agreement contained on a
final plat or other recorded document shall assure the private ownership, continued existence, and
maintenance of said boulevards and center islands. Such boulevards and center islands shall be
identified on a plat as an outlot.
EE. Bicycle paths are required within or adjacent to a subdivision/PUD where a bicycle path
is depicted on the City’s comprehensive planning documents and is shown as running through all
or a part of, or adjacent to, such subdivision/PUD. Bicycle paths shall also connect to existing
regional or area-wide bicycle path systems or be extended to such systems when they are located
within 1,000 feet of the subdivision/PUD. Bicycle paths may be installed in lieu of sidewalks.
8A.1.3 Tree Standards
A. While allowing for reasonable development of land, it is the stated public policy of the City
to add to the tree population where possible and to maintain existing trees within the City. The
planting of additional trees and the preservation of existing trees is intended to accomplish, the
following objectives: (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.6
1. To preserve trees as an important public resource enhancing the quality of life and the general
welfare of the City;
2. To conserve and enhance the City’s unique character and physical, historical, and aesthetic
environment;
3. To encourage the protection of healthy trees and provide for the replacement and/or
replanting of trees removed during construction, development or redevelopment;
4. To prevent clear cutting and to minimize mass grading;
5. To aid in the reduction of air pollution through the removal of harmful carbon dioxide, the
generation of oxygen, and the precipitation of dust and other airborne pollutants;
6. To reduce noise pollution through the baffle and barrier effect of trees on the spread of noise;
7. To reduce topsoil erosion through the soil retention effect of tree roots;
8. To reduce energy consumption through the natural windbreak and shade producing functions
of trees.
9. To preserve and enhance nesting areas for birds, insects, and other wildlife that are essential
to the maintenance of the food chain and that help control and eliminate disease-carrying
mosquitoes;
10. To reduce storm water runoff and replenish ground water supplies; and
11. To protect and increase property values.
B. Tree Protection
1. A minimum of 1 shade tree shall be planted in the front yard of each single-family residential
lot or building site and within 20 feet of abutting street right-of-way or easement used for lot
access. A minimum of 2 trees shall be required for lot, building site having an area of 15,000
or more square feet. For residential building lots containing a duplex dwelling unit, a
minimum of 2 trees shall be required. For residential building lots containing 3 or more
dwelling units or for non-residential lots or building sites, the number of required trees shall
be determined in accordance with the City’s landscape design guidelines at the time building
plan approval and permits are requested. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20,
2009).
2. As part of the preliminary plat and final engineering plan submittal, a tree survey as defined
and provided for in this Ordinance is required. Trees intended to be preserved shall be
depicted. A tree preservation plan prepared by a qualified arborist, forester, or similarly
qualified professional in the field of natural resources is also required as part of the final
engineering plan submittal. Failure to submit these items is a valid reason to delay
consideration of a preliminary plat or to withhold approval of final engineering plans or a
final plat until such items are available. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20,
2009).
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.7
3. The tree survey shall consist of a scaled drawing that shows the location of all desirable
native tree species listed in Table 8A.1 having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 4 or more
inches and all other existing trees with a DBH of 8 or more inches, excluding dead or dying
trees, buckthorn and similar invasive and noxious species.. In the case of a multi-stemmed
tree, the diameter of the clump taken as a whole shall be used. The survey shall include, at a
minimum, an inventory listing individual trees by tag number, the tree species by common
name and scientific name, size (DBH), condition, and any observed problems. Where trees
are within a permanently dedicated conservation easement or protected by deed restrictions
and will not be subject to grading activity, identification of individual trees is not required.
(Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
4. Where individual trees or stands of trees are removed on property proposed for development
or which is the subject of a development approval petition, including a annexation,
subdivision, PUD, or special use, the Plan Commission may recommend and the City Council
may require that the area containing the removed trees or stands of trees be replanted, made
subject to a tree preservation easement, and/or be maintained in perpetuity as open space.
(Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
5. As part of a final engineering and final plat submittal, the City shall require the
developer/owner to submit a tree survey, as defined in this Ordinance and as provided for
below, and a tree preservation plan prepared by a qualified arborist, forester, or similar
professional in the field of natural resources that is acceptable to the City. Failure to submit
these items shall be a valid reason to delay consideration or to withhold approval of final
engineering plans or a final plat until such items are available to the Plan Commission.
A. The survey shall consist of a scaled drawing that shows the location of all
desirable native tree species listed in Table 8A.1 having a diameter at breast
height (DBH) of 4 or more inches and all other existing trees with a DBH of 8
or more inches, including dead or dying trees. In the case of a multi-stemmed
tree, the diameter of the clump taken as a whole shall be used. The survey shall
include, at a minimum, an inventory listing individual trees by tag number, the
tree species by common name and scientific name, size (DBH), condition, and
any observed problems.
B. Where trees are located in a permanently dedicated conservation easement or
protected through deed restriction and will be free from any grading activity,
identification of individual trees is not required.
C. Where individual trees or stands of trees are removed on property proposed for
development or which is the subject of a development approval petition,
including a annexation, subdivision/PUD, or special use, the Plan Commission
may require that the area containing the removed trees or stands of trees be
replanted and that said area be dedicated as and made subject to a tree
preservation easement, and be maintained in perpetuity as open space.
6. During construction and development activity, reasonable steps shall be taken to prevent
damage to or destruction of protected trees. These steps shall include:
a Soils shall not be removed or disturbed within the critical root zone.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.8
b Protective fencing approved by the City shall be erected around the critical root
zone of any protected tree. Signage shall be affixed to said fence indicating the
presence of the critical root zone and a protected tree.
c All trees on property adjacent to the subject site and within 10 feet of the site’s
property line or having a critical root zone extending into the subject site, shall be
protected from unreasonable damage by the use of acceptable tree protection
measures.
d Mass cutting and grading are discouraged.
e The developer/owner shall ensure that all applicable subcontractors are trained in
proper tree protection.
f Excess soil, additional fill, equipment, trailers, liquids or construction debris shall
not be placed within the calculated critical root zone of any tree that is to remain at
its original location.
g Only protective non-damaging devices or attachments approved by the City shall be
attached to any tree during construction, and if approved by the City.
C. Tree Replacement
1. Unless otherwise authorized by the City, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or
corporation, whether owner, builder, developer, contractor or otherwise, to damage or
remove any protected tree. The term “remove” or “removal” shall mean (a) the actual
cutting, felling, chopping or any other similar procedure, the result of which is likely to
cause the death or substantial destruction of a tree, or (b) the effective removal through
damaging, poisoning, or other direct or indirect action resulting in or likely to result in
the death of a tree.
2. The removal of any protected tree prior to or without approval of the City is punishable
by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 per protected tree removed.
3. Invasive species, including but not limited to common buckthorn, glossy buckhorn, and
honeysuckle, which are commonly removed as part of good forestry practices and
ecological restoration, are not treated or acknowledged as protected tree species and
may be removed. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
4. Any protected tree removed pursuant to City approval shall be replaced as provided for
below:
Diameter of Removed Tree Number and Diameter of Replacement Trees
4 inches 1 tree @ 4 inches or
2 trees @ 2 1/2 inches
5-6 inches 1 tree @ 6 inches or
2 trees @ 3 inches
7-8 inches 1 tree @ 8 inches or
2 trees @ 4 inches or
3 trees @ 3 inches
9-10 inches 2 trees @ 5 inches or
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.9
3 trees @ 3 1/2 inches or
4 Trees @ 2 1/2 inches
11-12 inches 2 trees @ 6 inches or
3 trees @ 4 inches or
4 trees @ 3 inches
13 – 25 inches Minimum 2 trees @ 6 1/2 inches or
3 trees @ 4 1/2 inches or
6 trees @ 4 inches or
8 trees @ 3 inches
26 or more inches Minimum 9 trees @ 3 inches or
6 trees @ 4 1/2 inches or
4 trees @ 6 1/2 inches
5. When a high density of trees is not appropriate or the full replacement of trees on a site
would result in unreasonable crowding of trees, a fee in lieu of tree replacement and
ecological restoration may be approved by the City Council.
6. A tree replacement plan shall be prepared as part of the final engineering submittal by a
qualified arborist, forester, or similar professional in the field of natural resources. The
tree replacement plan shall depict the location and corresponding elevation of each
replacement tree and each preserved tree. Corresponding text shall state the species
and diameter of each tree with a description of the proposed management strategy to
ensure its health and survival on the property.
7. Replacement trees shall be high quality, locally grown, and of a species similar to that
of the tree removed. Whenever possible, trees with local genotypes (from a 250 mile
radius) should be used. All trees shall be installed free of disease and in a manner that
ensures the availability of sufficient soil and water to sustain healthy growth. Unless
otherwise approved by the City, replacement trees shall be from the following
varieties:
Table 8A.1: Desirable Native Tree Species
Acer nigrum Black Maple
Acer saccharum Sugar Maple
Aesculus glabra Ohio Buckeye
Carpinus caroliniana American Hornbeam
Carya cordiformis Bitternut Hickory

Quercus macrocarpa Bur Oak
Quercus rubra Red Oak
Quercus velutina Black Oak
Tilia americana Linden
7. Consistent with good forestry practices, replacement trees shall be of either equivalent or
a superior quality of species; for example, a softwood tree may be replaced with a
hardwood tree, but an inferior species shall not be substituted for a superior species. In
order to preserve and enhance the oak-hickory forest natural to Woodstock and McHenry
County, oak and hickory trees must be replaced in kind with native oak and hickory
species.
8. The following trees shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of the these tree
standards:
Table 8A.2: Prohibited Tree Species
Acer negundo Box Elder
Acer saccharinum Silver Maple

Populus species Poplar species
Rhamnus cathartica common buckthorn
Rhamnus fragula glossy buckthorn
Robina pseudoacacia Black locust
Ulmus pumila Siberian elm
D. Tree protection and tree replacement requirements shall not apply in the following instances
or exceptions:
1. Emergencies involving, but not limited to tornados, windstorms, floods, freezes or other
natural disasters;
2. Trees which have become, or immediately threaten to become, a hazard to persons,
property or other vegetation and require immediate removal or destruction. The City may
grant immediate verbal authorization by on-site inspection confirmed later with the
issuance of written authorization from the City;
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.11
3. Diseased, dead or dying trees as confirmed by the arborist, forester, or a qualified
professional in the field of natural resources and approved by the City;
4. All active orchards and state or government approved tree nurseries shall be exempt from
the terms and provisions of this chapter, but only in relation to those trees which are
planted and growing for the sale or intended sale to the general public in the ordinary
course of business or for a public purpose;
5. Invasive species, including but not limited to common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica),
glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and honeysuckle (Lonicera sp.), which are
commonly removed as part of good forestry practices and ecological restoration, are not
protected tree species.
E. Final approval and release of improvement guarantees shall not occur until final
inspection by the City confirms that the conditions of the tree preservation plan and tree
replacement plan have been met. In the event that conditions of either plan cannot be met, an
alternative plan shall be prepared or a fee-in-lieu of payment, to be determined by the City, may
be used to meet the objectives of this section.
8A.1.4 Street Lighting
Street lights shall be provided at all street intersections and where there are significant curves in
street alignment. The final determination regarding the type, number, and location of street lights
shall be made by the City Engineer except has provided for herein. Changes in the type of street
light fixture shall be approved by the City Engineer and, if applicable, by Commonwealth Edison.
The developer shall arrange and pay for all street light installation costs required by
Commonwealth Edison.
8A.1.5 Sanitary Sewer Collection System
All lots and building sites shall be served by the City’s municipal sanitary sewer system. Sanitary
sewer improvements shall be designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards
and specifications established by the City Engineer. Where a zoning lot in existence at the time
of the passage of this Ordinance is not legally or physically capable of connecting to the City’s
sanitary sewer system, solid waste disposal may be accommodated by a private septic system
approved by the McHenry County Health Department. The use of a private septic system shall be
subject to the property owner agreeing to connect to the City’s sanitary sewer system at such time
as it is within 200 feet of the subject property if a residential use or 1,000 feet of the subject
property if a non-residential or institutional use. Such agreement shall be provided by the
property owner in written form, shall be recorded in the Office of the McHenry County Recorder,
and shall be a covenant running with the land.
8A.1.6 Storm Water Management
Storm water management, drainage, and detention facilities shall be designed and installed in
compliance with the McHenry County Stormwater Management Ordinance, as amended and
adopted by the City. The use of “best management practices” to comply with storm water
management requirements is encouraged in order to provide water quality benefits and promote
groundwater recharge. The use of “best management practices” may occur when approved by the
City Engineer. In all cases an effort shall be made to design stormwater management facilities,
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8A.12
including detention ponds and drainage swales, in a manner that complements existing natural
features on and adjoining the development site.
8A.1.7 Potable Water System
All lots and building sites shall be served by the City’s municipal water system. Water system
improvements shall be designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards and
specifications established by the City Engineer. Where a zoning lot in existence at the time of the
passage of this Ordinance is not legally or physically capable of connecting to the City’s potable
water system, potable water may be provided by a private well system approved by the McHenry
County Health Department. The use of a private well system shall be subject to the property
owner agreeing to connect to the City’s water system at such time as it is within 200 feet of the
subject property if a residential use or 1,000 feet of the subject property if a non-residential or
institutional use. Such agreement shall be provided by the property owner in written form, shall
be recorded in the Office of the McHenry County Recorder, and shall be a covenant running with
the land.

8B.3 Conservation Development Site Design
8B.4 Permissible and Prohibited Activities
8B.5 Approval Process
8B.6 Density Bonuses for Open Space and Design Features
8B.7 Design Standards
8B.1 Purpose The primary purpose of these conservation design standards and
regulations is to promote the health of the community and to protect its natural and environmental
resources through the application of flexible land development techniques to the arrangement and
construction of dwellings, roads, drainage systems, and infrastructure improvements.
Commentary:
The standards and regulations in this Chapter pertain to the development of land using a “conservation
design” approach. The “conservation design” approach can be used with a variety of development
applications, including special use permits, planned unit developments, traditional neighborhood
developments, and the development of individual building sites and zoning lots. The submittal
requirements and steps in the approval process for these applications are provided elsewhere in this
Ordinance. The intent of this Chapter 8B is to advise the development community of additional
requirements and benefits associated with “conservation design” and the alternative design features
which can be used and that will benefit the City’s natural resource base.
The standards in this Chapter are based on information from a number of publications, including the
following:
 Conservation Design Resource Manual: Language and Guidelines for Updating
Local Ordinances, Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission/Chicago Wilderness,
March 2003.
 Growing Greener – A Conservation Planning Workbook for Municipal Officials in
Pennsylvania, Natural Lands Trust, October 1998.
 Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide to Creating Open Space
Networks, Randall G. Arendt, 1996.
 Best Development Practices, Reid Ewing, 1996.
 Section 14, Requirements for design and Improvements, Code of Ordinances, Town
of Caledonia, Wisconsin.
 Etowah HCP Model Conservation Subdivision Ordinance, Etowah Habitat
Conservation Plan, October 2005.
These publications may provide additional guidance and motivation to the developer regarding the use
of conservation design standards and techniques.
Such flexibility is intended to retain or increase the development rights of the property owner and
the number of occupancy units permitted by the underlying zoning designation, while
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.2
encouraging environmentally responsible development. “Conservation design” is most
appropriate in areas having natural and open space resources to be protected and preserved in
perpetuity. These include floodplains, groundwater recharge areas, wetlands, woodlands,
streams, wildlife habitat and migratory nesting sites, severe slopes, and historic and cultural
resources. It is a system that first takes into account the natural landscape and ecology of a
development site rather than determining design features on the basis of pre-established density
criteria. “Conservation design” facilitates development while maintaining and preserving the
most valuable natural features and functions of a site. The regulations contained herein are
intended to:
A. Conserve open land, including areas containing unique and sensitive natural features
such as woodlands, wetlands, steep slopes, streams, groundwater recharge areas,
floodplains, by setting them aside from development.
B. Provide diverse lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices that can accommodate
a variety of age and income groups and population groups.
C. Create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land and with a strong
neighborhood identity.
D. Conserve scenic views and elements of Woodstock’s rural character, and to minimize
perceived density by minimizing views of new development from existing roads.
E. Avoid development on and prevent destruction of sensitive natural resource areas.
F. Provide a wider range of sites for the use of stormwater “best management practices”.
G. Reduce the quantity and improve the quality of stormwater runoff from new
development and minimize impervious surfaces.
H. Reduce soil erosion by retaining and/or reintroducing native plant species and
minimizing development on steep slopes.
I. Reduce and minimize encroachments into resource conservation areas and resource
conservation corridors.
J. Reduce the cost of public services required for new development and increase future
property value.
K. Create livable and sustainable mixed-use communities.
L. Establish a method for resolving development challenges in a creative and efficient
manner.
8B.2 Application
The regulations set forth in this Chapter shall apply to subdivisions/PUDs which contain areas or
abut areas designated as “resource conservation” or “resource conservation corridor” on the
City’s comprehensive planning documents or are characterized by sensitive natural resources.
Where an application for planned unit development, subdivision, or special use approval is
requested for land depicted as “resource conservation” or “resource conservation corridor” in the
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.3
City’s comprehensive planning documents or for land that is characterized by sensitive natural
resources, compliance with this Chapter is required unless waived by the Plan Commission. The
City may require compliance with these standards and regulations as a condition of annexation.
Commentary:
The term “best management practices” can be defined based upon the characteristics of the
development site. Specific “best management practices” vary depending upon several factors, including
location (urban, suburban, rural), climate (warm, moderate, cold), or circulation preference (pedestrian,
automobile, public transit). They are also used to address specific public issues pertaining to housing,
crime prevention, transportation, and energy efficiency. Not all “best management practices” are
applicable in every situation and in some instances may be detrimental to the planning goals and
objectives of a community.
In regard to conservation design, “best management practices” refers to a combination of conservation
measures, structures, or management efforts that reduces or avoids adverse effects of development on a
site, on adjoining land, and on waterways and water bodies. “Best management practices” are used to
control soil loss and enhance water quality, to minimize impacts to surface water and groundwater
resources, to improve water circulation patterns, and to reduce negative impacts to the chemical,
physical, and biological characteristics of wetlands. The application of “best management practices”
should be used whenever possible to achieve the City’s development goals and objectives.
Examples of “best management practices” are listed below. The list is not exhaustive and the practices
listed may not necessarily be applicable in all situations or in Woodstock.
 Keep vehicle miles of travel below the area or regional average.
 Develop in clusters and keep the clusters small.
 Place higher density housing near commercial centers, public transit opportunities, and park and
recreational amenities.
 Phase convenience shopping and recreational opportunities to keep pace with housing growth.
 Make subdivisions into neighborhoods with well-defined centers and edges.
 Reserve school and park sites and require them in order to attract new schools and parks.
 Concentrate commercial development in compact centers, rather than spread out in strips.
 Make shopping centers and business parks into all-purpose activity centers.
 Separate auto-oriented land uses from pedestrian-oriented uses.
 Design street networks with multiple connections and relatively direct routes.
 Use traffic calming measures where appropriate in neighborhood settings.
 Keep speeds on local streets down to 20 miles per hour.
 Keep speeds on collector streets down to 30 to 35 miles per hour.
 Keep local streets as narrow as possible and not more than 4 lanes wide.
 Align streets to give buildings energy efficient orientations.
 Provide interconnected networks for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
 Provide pedestrians and bicyclists with alternatives to traveling along high-volume streets.
 Encourage infill development and channel development activity into already disturbed areas.
 Preserve high quality habitat areas as large and as circular as possible, with feathering at the edges
and, where possible, connected to wild-life corridors.
 Preserve, protect, and enhance migratory nesting sites, especially when located within
environmentally sensitive or valuable areas.
 Design around significant high quality, high function, and ADID wetlands.
 Establish upland buffers around all retained wetlands and natural water bodies.
 Preserve significant existing uplands.
 Restore and enhance environmental functions disrupted or destroyed by previous site activities.
 Minimize stormwater runoff by clustering development on the least porous soils and using infiltration
devices and permeable pavement materials.
 Detain runoff with open, natural drainage systems.
 Design artificial or constructed lakes and stormwater ponds for maximum habitat value.
 Use reclaimed water and integrated pest management on large landscaped areas.
 Use organic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers for lawn application purposes.
 Offer life cycle housing opportunities.

Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.4
 Use cost-effective site development and construction practices.
 Design internal energy saving features
 Maximize opportunities for energy efficiency and green technology, including but not limited to
opportunities in the areas of insulation, appliances, and renewable energy.
 Supply affordable single -family homes for moderate-income families.
 Supply affordable multifamily and accessory housing for low-income families.
 Mix housing according to type and cost to the extent that the market will bear.
Conservation design standards and regulations may be incorporated into and approved through
either the planned unit development process or the subdivision approval process, as well as
through the City’s project review and building permit review process. The conservation design
approach may be applied to a portion of a development site and it can be used or combined with
other approaches to land development, such as a traditional neighborhood development.
8B.3 Conservation Development Site Design
The primary factor in determining acceptable site design is the land and its underlying
characteristics. Proposed development shall be designed to fit the topography, physical features,
and soil conditions of the subject site. Site design that recognizes natural drainage patterns, the
use and preservation of native vegetation and the stabilization of soils during construction, and
which protects, enhances, and maintains natural resources is encouraged. The general steps
indicated below shall be followed when designing the layout and arrangement of a development
site. Additional information about the conservation design process, including visual renderings
prepared for each phase in the “conservation design” process can be found in Exhibit I.
A. The first step is to identify all natural resources, conservation areas, open space areas,
and physical features (floodplain, wetlands, lakes, ponds, channels and other water
bodies, steep slopes, mature and young woodlands and significant trees, meadows and
prairies, and soil types) on the site. Significant vistas and scenic areas that are present on
the property and worthy of preservation shall also be identified. These features shall be
preserved and protected from any negative impacts generated as a result of the
development or other land disturbing activities.
B. The second step is to locate building sites. Once natural resources and conservation
areas are identified, building sites should be located to take advantage of open space and
scenic views. Smaller lot areas and smaller lot widths which maximize the number of
lots abutting natural resources and conservation areas should be considered in order to
provide more efficient use of the land, as well as to protect the development rights of the
property owner and the number of occupancy units permitted by the underlying zoning
of the property.
C. The third step is to design the street and circulation necessary to provide access to
building sites and to allow movement throughout the subdivision and onto adjoining
lands. The street layout should avoid sensitive natural resources such as wetlands,
woodlands, significant tree stands, and wildlife habitats, and should be designed to take
advantage of open space vistas. Interconnection of internal streets and street connections
to adjoining land parcels should be provided to create opportunities for future
connectivity.

Conservation and Natural Resources, October 1998.Design
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.6
D. The fourth step is to establish lot lines and lot sizes in order to take maximum advantage
of conservation subdivision concepts. This step creates individual building lots and
allows ownership of said lots to be transferred from one land owner to the next.
E. A fifth and final step, which is separate from the initial conservation design approach but
which is required for all development proposals in the City, is to prepare engineering
plans which indicate how each building site can be served by essential public utilities,
while at the same time acknowledging the need to preserve and protect the
environmental resources on a site. This may require innovation on the part of the
engineering professional in order to provide utility service while protecting natural
resources and amenities.
8B.4 Permissible and Prohibited Activities
A. Permissible activities are those in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. As
part of the review and approval process for a conservation design development, a mix of
different uses may be approved. Within dedicated open space areas, permitted activities
may include the following:
1. Conservation of natural, archeological, or historical resources;
2. Meadows, woodlands, wetlands, wildlife corridors, games preserves, or similar
conservation-oriented areas;
3. Pedestrian paths or bicycle trails, constructed of either porous or paved material, as
determined by the City Engineer;
4. Active recreation areas provided they comprise no more than 10% of the total open
space on the site;
5. Passive recreation areas such as open fields or observation areas;
6. Nonstructural stormwater management facilities and practices that allow for
infiltration, such as bioretention areas;
7. Easements for drainage, access, and underground utility lines; or
8. Other conservation-oriented uses compatible with the purposes of this Chapter.
B. To ensure the preservation and enhancement of existing natural resources, including but
not limited to constrained and sensitive lands, natural and cultural resources, wildlife
habitat and other unique and sensitive lands, development activity using a “conservation
design” approach shall not commence prior to the granting of any other required
development approvals. All subsequent development activity shall be conducted in
accordance with and subject to applicable permit and development approval requirements
of the City. For purposes of this Chapter, the term “development activity” shall include
any disturbance or alteration of the property in any way, but shall not include
continuation of any currently existing permitted use of the property.
C. Subject to the provisions set forth herein, any provision of this Chapter may be waived by
the Plan Commission. Such waivers may only be granted for good cause based upon
specific circumstances or conditions attached to the property. No waiver shall be granted
that would be contrary to the public interest or contrary to the intent of this Chapter. Any
waiver of minimum conservation land dedication standards shall require comparable
compensation, off-site improvements, amenities, or other consideration of comparable
size, quality, and/or value.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.7
8B.5 Approval Process
Development approval applications for conservation design projects shall comply with the
applicable submittal and content requirements of this Ordinance and the requirements of this
Chapter. A conservation design planned unit development or subdivision shall comply with and
be processed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 “Planned Unit Developments,”
Chapters 6A “General Requirements for Subdivisions, Planned Unit Developments, and Plats”,
6B “Subdivisions and Planned Unit Developments: Pre-Application and Preliminary Plat
Approval Process”, and 6C “Subdivisions and Planned Unit Developments: Final Plat and Final
Engineering Plan Content and Approval Processes” of this Ordinance. A special use permit shall
comply with and be processed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 “General Review
Procedures” of this Ordinance.
In addition to the aforesaid requirements, a “Site Yield Plan”, “Natural Resources Inventory”, and
“Open Space Ownership and Stewardship Plan” are required. These items shall be prepared as
part of a pre-application submittal (see Section 6B.1.2) and as part of a preliminary plat submittal
(see Section 6B.2.4), or for any other site intended to be developed as a conservation design
project:
8B.5.1 Site Yield Plan
All applications for conservation design projects shall include a Site Yield Plan prepared in
accordance with the following provisions. The Site Yield Plan shall be used to determine and
calculate the base number of dwelling or occupancy units for any given property intended to be a
conservation design development.
A. A Site Yield Plan for the proposed project shall be provided and shall indicate how the
property can be developed under a conventional design layout using the standards in
Chapter 7A for the underlying zoning district. The Site Yield Plan is not intended to
propose or permit the actual development of the property in accordance with the
standards in Chapter 7A, but is presented to depict a base number of dwelling or
occupancy units that could be constructed if the project was designed as a conventional
development, and thereby the number of dwelling or occupancy units for the
conservation design development.
B. A conservation design development is intended to serve an overlay function, the sole
purpose of which is to permit property to be developed using conservation design
standards contained herein. Except as otherwise permitted, the underlying zoning district
provisions shall apply.
C. The Site Yield Plan shall be drawn to scale and shall exhibit a realistic design reflecting a
conventional subdivision layout that could reasonably expected to be implemented given
the required dimensional standards, the presence of non-buildable areas, natural resource
areas, existing encumbrances, and the need for utility easements and right-of-way.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.8
8B.5.2 Natural Features Inventory
All applications for conservation design projects shall include an inventory of natural features
prepared according to the provisions set forth herein. The natural features inventory shall identify
all natural and cultural resources, floodplains, wetlands, severe slopes, meadows, grasslands, tree
stands, streams and stream corridors, watercourses, farmland, rapidly permeable soils, wildlife
corridors and habitat, historic buildings and/or sites, archeological sites, green spaces, and views
and viewsheds on the property and within 400 feet of the property. Applicants are solely
responsible for ensuring the accuracy and designation of natural features in said inventory for
their particular project and adjacent applicable property. If this requires entry onto adjacent
properties, applicants are solely responsible for obtaining all required permits and/or approvals
for such entry and analysis. This submittal shall include, but is not limited to, a “Natural
Resource Inventory (NRI) Report” furnished by the McHenry County Soil and Water
Conservation District. The applicant shall at its own expense order and furnish the required
information to the District and have a report presented to the Community Development
Department.
8B.5.3 Open Space Ownership and Stewardship Plan
A. Ownership. The ultimate owner of dedicated open space, as well as the entity
responsible for maintaining it, shall be identified. If a homeowners association or
condominium association is the owner, membership in the association shall be mandatory
and automatic for all lot and parcel owners and their successors. The association shall
have lien authority to ensure the collection of dues from all members. The responsibility
for maintaining the open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the
owner. In the event an association ceases to exist the responsibility for maintaining the
open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by all lot and parcel owners
or by the owners of those lots and/or parcels which abut the dedicated open space.
B. Conservation Easement Required. Dedicated open space shall be protected in
perpetuity by a binding conservation easement or similar binding legal instrument
recorded with the McHenry County Recorder and granted in favor of one or more of the
following entities, which entity shall be shall be responsible for all maintenance, control,
and insurance of common areas, including dedicated open space and natural areas:
1. A public agency such as the McHenry County Conservation District. Such
agency may, but is not required to, accept dedication in the form of fee simple ownership
of the designated natural area provided it has access to and agrees to maintain such
natural areas and open space.
2. A homeowners or property owners association. Membership in such an
association shall be mandatory for the owners and purchasers of all lots and/or parcels in
the development. The association shall be responsible for all maintenance, control, and
insurance of common areas, including the dedicated natural areas.
3. A not-for-profit entity whose primary purpose is the preservation and
maintenance of conservation areas and natural resources. Such conservation areas and
natural resources shall be established in the form of conservation easements.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.9
C. Corrective Action. After 15 days written notice, the City may enter dedicated open
space areas in order to take corrective action necessary to ensure compliance with this
Chapter 8B and the provision of extended maintenance, when such action has not been
provided by the entity responsible for such actions. The costs of such corrective action
may be charged to the property owner, condominium association, homeowners
association, conservation organization or not-for-profit organization, or individual
property owners, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall
become a lien on said properties and shall be filed by the City with the McHenry Country
Recorder.
D. Stewardship Plan. Every conservation design development must include a plan that
provides a means to properly manage dedicated open space in perpetuity and the longterm
means to properly manage and maintain all dedicated open space. The plan shall be
approved as part of the applicable development review process. The plan shall be in
textual form and may include graphic renderings. The plan shall provide specific details
and methods regarding the preservation, re-establishment, maintenance, and management
of open areas and natural resources in perpetuity on the subject site. It shall be in a
format that is easily understood and shall identify specific tasks which must be completed
in order to ensure the viability of current and future resources on the site. It shall allocate
responsibility and guidelines for performing said tasks, and shall include provisions for
long-term capital improvements. It shall also serve as an educational resource for future
residents and property owners. The plan shall do the following:
• Designate the ownership of natural features and dedicated open space.
• Establish necessary regular and periodic operation and management responsibilities.
• Estimate staffing needs, insurance, and other associated costs and define the means
for funding these on an on-going basis.
• Allocate responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the
dedicated open space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for
ongoing maintenance and long term capital improvements.
• Estimate the cost and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of,
and insurance for, the dedicated open space and describe the means by which such
funding will be obtained or provided.
• Provide that the plan shall not be changed without the approval of the City and
describe how the plan will be enforced.
In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the dedicated open space fails to
maintain all or any portion of it in reasonable order and condition, the City may assume
responsibility for its maintenance. The costs of such maintenance shall be charged to the
responsible party as set forth in this Section 8B.5.3 and may include administrative costs
and penalties. Such costs may become a lien on all lots and parcels.
E. Performance Standards. The Stewardship Plan shall include performance standards for
all natural open space areas and naturalized stormwater management facilities and
buffers. The performance standards shall identify proposed methods for establishing the
areas and shall require monitoring and maintenance for three full growing seasons
following planting. The purpose of establishing and ensuring compliance with
performance standards is to ensure that the overall design intent for these areas is
achieved and maintained. The design intent for such facilities is to provide an aesthetic,
healthy, diverse community of native vegetation to meet the objectives of soil
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.10
stabilization, water quality improvement, and wildlife habitat. Minimum performance
standards for prairies, wet-detention basins, drainage swales, and buffer areas are
included in “Appendix JA”. Under circumstances where the minimum performance
standards cannot be achieved, alternative performance standards must be presented to and
approved by the City.
F. Open Space Special Service Area. The City, at its discretion, may require the
establishment of a “back up” special service area (SSA) in order to provide funds
necessary to support the maintenance and upkeep of land set side and dedicated as open
space area or used for required utilities and development improvements. Such a
requirement may be a condition of final plat approval and the creation of such an SSA
shall occur prior to the sale of individual lots or building sites.
8B.6 Density Bonuses for Open Space and Design Features
A. The permitted number of dwelling or occupancy units in a conservation design
development shall be the base density as determined by the Site Yield Plan. However, the
City Council may grant a density bonus or bonuses after a review of the proposed
conservation design plan and the finding that the proposed development offers a superior
layout and quality of design which incorporates environmentally sensitive design
features. These features shall include, but are not limited to the preservation of scenic
vistas, preservation of natural areas, incorporation of natural landscapes, protection of
wildlife habitat, preservation of mature trees, and the creation of landscape buffers. The
extent of a density bonus shall be based on the percentage of the site reserved as open
space. A density bonus shall not, however, be awarded for any improvement, design, or
action required by local, state, or federal law. The density bonuses noted in the
following chart are maximum percentage increases in the number of permitted dwelling
or occupancy units. No minimum or maximum lot sizes are established for conservation
design projects in order to allow for maximum flexibility when arranging building sites.
Total Amount of Open Space Area ¹ Allowable Increase in Density ²
51 – 55 % 5 %
56 -65 % 7.5 %
66 -75 % 10 %
75+ % 12.5 %
¹ As a percentage of total development area minus nonbuildable
and restricted areas. The above percentages
include the base amount of open space required of all
conservation design developments.
² As a percentage of the number of permitted
dwelling or occupancy units allowed by the base
density allowed by the Site Yield Plan and is not
cumulative. Where the application of the resultant
percentage results in a fractional number of
dwelling units, said number shall be rounded up to
the next whole number.
B. The City Council may grant a density bonus or bonuses after a review of the proposed
conservation design plan and the finding that the proposed development provides the
following features:
Design Feature Allowable Increase in Density ¹
More than 35% of residential dwellings are served by side
load attached garages.
1%
More than 75% of the lots or building sites abut open
space on at least one side.
1%
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.11
Internal trails are connected with existing or potential trails
outside of the development.
2%
Internal open spaces are connected with existing or
potential open spaces outside of the development.
2%
¹ As a percentage of the number of permitted dwelling or occupancy units allowed by the underlying or preexisting
zoning designation. Each allowable increase in density shall be a percentage of the base density allowed
by the Site Yield Plan and is not cumulative. Where the application of the resultant percentage results in a
fractional number of dwelling units, said number shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
Commentary:
Density bonuses allow a developer to have additional dwelling or occupancy units if conservation
design amenities beyond those required by this Chapter are provided. For example, if a developer
decides to increase the amount of open space within a 150 unit residential subdivision so that at
least 66 percent of the subject site consists of open space, the number of dwelling or occupancy
units could increase by up to 10 percent or 15 units, allowing a total of 165 units.
8B.7 Design Standards
Except as waived or altered by the Plan Commission, lots, streets, building and structure location,
and the overall layout and development of a conservation design site shall comply, to the greatest
extent possible, with the standards listed below. Additional “best management practices” may be
required by the Plan Commission in order to provide greater protection of the City’s natural
resource base.
A. Land Suitability
No land shall be developed which is unsuitable for a proposed use if said land is
identified as being environmentally sensitive. Areas identified as environmentally
sensitive may include, but are not limited to those with the following features:
1. All areas identified as floodplain by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
Illinois Department of Natural Resources, or other public or private entity.
2. All wetlands under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
3. All areas within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable streams and
lakes.
4. Areas known to provide habitat for rare, threatened, or endangered species.
5. Land designated as “resource conservation” by the City’s comprehensive planning
documents.
B. General Standards
1. Conservation developments shall identify a conservation theme or combination of
themes at the time of initial application. Conservation themes shall be based on the
natural resource features of the development site and may include, but are not limited
to forest stewardship, water quality preservation and enhancement, native landscape
restoration and preservation, natural habitat restoration, viewshed preservation,
archeological and historical preservation.
2. Conservation developments shall preserve, restore, and/or create environmentally
sensitive areas such as wetlands, natural habitat for rare, threatened and endangered
species, woodlands, rain gardens, prairies, meadows, primary or secondary
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.12
environmental corridors, parklands and viewsheds, and shall include plans and the
means to restore, manage, and maintain such areas. These areas may be preserved or
restored to their natural state, designed and intended for the passive use and/or
enjoyment of residents or users of the proposed development, or preserved in order to
expand and extend the usefulness of existing preserved open space and natural areas.
3. Common open space shall to the extent practical, include open space areas in
addition to water bodies, ponds, or mapped wetlands that have been identified.
4. Common open space shall be identified, restored, managed, and maintained.
5. Re-use of historical buildings and structures, identified by the Illinois Historic
Preservation Agency, shall apply unless the Plan Commission determines otherwise
for good cause.
6. Conservation developments shall take into consideration how abutting land with
significant natural areas and resources will impact or be impacted by the conservation
development.
7. Natural areas and resources, as well as protective buffer areas, shall be preserved on
the development site. Dedicated natural areas shall be interconnected where possible
with open space areas, greenways, and trail systems within the development site and
on abutting lands where possible and appropriate.
8. Enclosures which surround all or a portion of a lot or parcel, and thereby reduce the
amount of unrestricted open space, are not allowed. This restriction shall be placed
on a final plat or other document of record and established as a covenant or deed
restriction.
C. Natural and Open Space Standards
1. At least 50 percent of a conservation design development site shall be set aside as
dedicated open space. For purposes of this Chapter, the term “open space” shall
mean any land or area the preservation of which in its present use would (a) conserve
and enhance natural or scientific resources; or (b) protect floodplains, streams or
water supply; or (c) promote conservation of soils and wetlands; or (d) preserve
wildlife habitat; or (e) protect historic and cultural sites; or (f) enhance recreational
opportunities. The term “open space” includes land and water areas retained for use
as active and passive recreation areas or for resource protection in an essentially
undeveloped state.
2. The natural area counted toward this set-aside shall consist of land, not necessarily
undisturbed, which either retains or has been substantially restored to its original
natural or native character. Natural area counted toward this shall not include
parkways, landscape islands, or similar features. Partial credit may be, although not
necessarily, granted for wetlands, floodplains, or other inherently unbuildable areas.
Yard and setback areas on individual lots shall not be considered natural areas or
open space unless designated on a final plat or similar recorded document as “deed
restricted open space” or as having similar restricted use status.
3. Natural and open space areas shall be maintained in perpetuity and shall not be
improved with any buildings or structures unless approved by the City and where
such buildings or structures will not negatively impact the natural and open space
areas. This restriction shall run with the land and be binding on future owners,
successors and assigns of the grantee.
4. Whenever and wherever possible, natural and open space areas shall connect with
existing or potential open space lands on adjoining parcels and local or regional trail
systems.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.13
D. Performance Standards for Residential Lots
1. Residential structures are not required to be on individual lots and more than one
primary building may be on a single land parcel. Lot size, shape, and orientation
shall be appropriate for the location of the development and for the type of
development and use being considered.
2. No minimum or maximum lot size shall be imposed, however, when lot sizes are
approved that are smaller than allowed by underlying zoning, front and rear yard
setbacks may be reduced. In no case shall such reductions be less than twenty (20)
feet for a front yard setback and twenty (20) feet for a rear yard setback.
3. Residential lots or building envelopes shall be large enough to accommodate a house
and two-car garage.
4. Lots shall be approximately rectangular in shape, with the exception of lots located
on a curved street or on a cul-de-sac turn-around.
5. Side lot lines shall, where practical, be at right angles to straight street lines or radial
to curved streets which the lots face.
6. Flag lots are prohibited.
7. Every lot shall front or abut a public street or have other approved means of access.
8. Lots shall be configured to minimize the amount of impervious surfaces including
paved roads.
9. Lot access shall, where practical, be from an interior street.
10. Lots shall, where appropriate, be adjacent to or around one or more of the following:
central green or square, physical amenity such as a meadow, stand of trees, stream or
other water body, or some existing or restored natural feature.
11. Building setbacks, frontage requirements, lot line dimensions, and building height
shall be established during the review and approval of the conservation development
design.
E. Buffer Standards
The following distance buffers are required:
1. From existing perimeter arterial streets to a structure: a minimum of 100 feet.
2. From existing perimeter collector streets to a structure: a minimum of 50 feet.
3. From a development parcel’s boundaries to a lot line: a minimum of 40 feet.
4. From cropland or pastureland to a lot line: a minimum of 50 feet.
5. From dwellings in other subdivisions: a minimum of 75 feet.
6. Buffers shall consist of berms, landscaping, water features, or similar improvements.
Where necessary in order to screen new housing or incompatible development, or to
preserve scenic views, or otherwise enhance the landscape as seen from existing
perimeter roads and from within the development conservation design development,
a mix of trees, shrubs, and native landscape materials shall be provided as part of the
buffer. These requirements may be waived or reduced by the Plan Commission.
F. Cluster Design Standards
1. Lots, buildings, and building sites should be clustered or grouped together. Lot and
building site size may be less than that required by the underlying zoning in order to
achieve greater preservation and protection of natural resources.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.14
2. Such clusters or groups should be located so as to minimize negative impacts on the
natural, visual, and cultural resources of the site and between incompatible uses and
activities.
3. Such clusters or groups should avoid encroaching on rare plant communities, high
quality habitats, or endangered species.
4. Such clusters or groups should be designed and sited to achieve the following goals:
 Minimize disturbance to woodlands, wetlands, grasslands, mature trees, and
steep slopes.
 Prevent negative downstream impacts to waterways due to runoff by utilizing onsite
stormwater management practices.
 Maintain and protect scenic views of open land from adjacent and proposed
roads. Minimize visual impact through the use of landscaping, berming, and
other similar features.
 Protect buildings and sites of historic significance or incorporate them through
adaptive reuse.
5. Landscaping around the building cluster or group should be provided where
appropriate to reduce off-site views of the buildings, and such landscaping should be
comprised to the greatest extent possible of native plant species.
G. Street and Sidewalk Standards
1. Neighborhood streets may take the form of a two-way street, a pair of one-way
streets on either side of a landscaped median, or a one-way loop street around a
landscaped median. Driving aisles within a neighborhood street shall have a
minimum width of 12.5 feet except as provided for herein. Said width shall not
include the width of curb and gutter improvements.
2. Non-neighborhood streets, such as collectors or arterials, shall meet the improvement
and design standards required by this Ordinance for all other streets not within a
conservation design development.
3. Pavement width, excluding curb and gutter, for local/neighborhood streets shall be as
follows, subject to approval of the City Engineer.
 Parking restricted on both sides: 25 feet
 Parking restricted on one side: 28 feet
4. Streets shall be developed according to standards that promote road safety, provide
adequate access for emergency vehicles, and allow for adequate vehicular circulation
and movement.
5. The use of enclosed drainage curb and gutter systems is discouraged in favor of
vegetated swales where a significant environmental benefit will be realized.
6. Sidewalks shall be installed on at least one side of a street and may be required by the
City Council to be installed on both sides of a street. Sidewalks shall connect
residential areas to common open space areas, and provide convenient pedestrian
access throughout the conservation design development and from the development
site to other areas of the City. The City Council may waive all or a portion of the
sidewalk requirements.
7. Sidewalks located within a public street right-of-way shall have a maximum width of
6 feet and a minimum width of 4 feet, except as provided for in this Ordinance or
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.15
unless used to accommodate bicycle traffic, in which case the maximum width may
be exceeded.
8. When the conservation design development provides a pedestrian system with access
equal to or greater than the provision of sidewalks along public street rights-of-way,
said pedestrian system may be installed in lieu of sidewalks along public streets.
9. Sidewalks dedicated and/or intended for public use shall be have a hard, dust-free
surface. Walkways not designed for public use may have alternative surfaces.
10. Private drives and parking areas may be built with alternative surfaces and designs,
including permeable pavers, subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
11. Shared or common drives shall be permitted and shall comply with the following
standards, provided there is a recorded covenant applicable to the properties utilizing
such drive which establishes standards for its maintenance and use.
12. A common drive may serve multiple units and may be built to serve residential or
non-residential uses. A common drive shall extend from a public or private street
and may connect to other existing or planned public or private streets.
I. Stormwater Management Standards
1. Integrated management practices designed to capture, use, detain, retain, and treat
stormwater and enable it to enter the ground shall be utilized as part of a
development site’s overall stormwater management plan. Compliance with the
City’s Stormwater Management Ordinance, as well as the following stormwater
management measures is required:
• Maximize the use of open swales and bioswales, and similar “best management
practices”, including but not limited to the use of vegetated swales, permeable
storm sewer pipe, porous pavement for private driveways and sidewalks,
vegetated buffers and strips, and retention of groups of trees and other
vegetation to help natural hydrology.
• Drain roof downspouts to porous surfaces, rain barrels, or rain gardens.
• Design stormwater management systems and facilities to capture at least 75% of
the post-development sediment load on an annual basis.
• Use natural landscape planting to increase water infiltration and decrease runoff
where soil conditions are suitable and building foundation problems will not be
created.
• Preserve natural open space drainage systems ways and incorporate them into
the stormwater management system for the overall development.
2. Stormwater management, drainage, and detention facilities shall be designed and
installed in compliance with the McHenry County Stormwater Management
Ordinance, as amended and adopted by the City.
3. The amount of soil compaction, clearing, and grading at a development site shall be
minimized and the extent that impervious surfaces are directly linked to each other
shall be limited.
4. The mass grading of development sites is discouraged and is limited to between 20
and 40 acres at any one time. Large developments shall stabilize areas of up to 40
acres that are graded before proceeding with subsequent grading activity. Buffers
shall be installed to protect natural resources and amenities. Buffers which are
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 8B.16
located in close proximity to or abut such natural resources and amenities, shall be
planted and stabilized prior to the start of grading activity.
5. Rooftop runoff and sump pump discharge shall be directed to pervious areas, such as
yards, open space, grassed swales, or vegetated areas, via sheet flow or in a similar
diffused manner.
6. The routing of rooftop runoff and sump pump discharge to roadways is permitted
only with the approval of the City Engineer.
J. Use of Native Landscaping
The use of native plant materials for landscaping is required throughout and along the perimeter
of the development site, including those areas containing drainage swales, detention basins,
common areas, at the edges of streams, lakes, wetlands, and other water bodies, and the perimeter
of the development site.
Commentary:
The City of Woodstock places a high value on natural landscaping design and the use of native plant
species. All landscaping activities are encouraged to create landscapes that serve a beneficial natural
function and that contribute to the overall preservation and expansion of the natural environment.
Appendix H provides a regarding the City’s position on natural landscaping and suggest how a
developer should approach the design and selection of landscape amenities.

9.17 Schedule of Required Loading Spaces
9.1 Purpose The purpose of this Chapter is to provide regulations which prevent,
alleviate, or minimize congestion on public streets, and promote the public safety and welfare through
the establishment of minimum requirements for off-street parking and loading improvements in
accordance with the use of property and its zoning designation.
9.2 Scope The off-street parking and loading provisions of this Chapter apply as follows:
A. All buildings, structures, and land uses, as well as all modifications of buildings and
structures which increase the total floor area or the intensity of use, established and initiated
on or after the effective date of these regulations shall be provided with accessory off-street
parking and loading facilities as required herein. Any permit for the construction or
enlargement of a building or structure, issued before the effective date of this Ordinance,
shall comply with requirements in effect at the time of permit issuance.
B. Whenever the existing use of a building or structure is changed to a new use, parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. However, if the said
building or structure was erected before the effective date of this Chapter, additional parking
or loading facilities shall be required, but only in the amount by which the requirements for
the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to the parking
and loading provisions of this Chapter.
C. If a building or structure is decreased in size because of a reduction in the number of dwelling
units, floor area, seating capacity, employees or other units of measurement, the required
number of parking and loading spaces may be decreased proportionately in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 9.2
D. If a building or structure is enlarged or if a new building is constructed, the required number
of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be increased as provided herein, except for
properties located within a special service area formed to provide public parking
improvements. Non-participating properties within such a special service area, however,
shall be required to comply fully with these provisions. (Ordinance Number 09-O-64,
adopted October 20, 2009).
9.3 General Provisions
A. Every development or change in use shall provide off-street parking and loading facilities in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
B. Any application for a permit for a new or enlarged building or structure, or for an expanded
or changed use, shall include a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned. The site plan
shall depict such new or enlarged building or structure, along with parking and loading
facilities necessary to fulfill the requirements of these regulations.
9.3.1 Reserved
9.3.2 Existing Parking and Loading Facilities
Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities located on the same lot or parcel as the building
being served or the use being served and which existed as of the effective date of this Ordinance may
not be reduced in number unless the number of said spaces exceeds the requirements of this Chapter
for equivalent new construction. If this is the case, said spaces shall not be reduced below the number
required herein for such equivalent new construction.
9.3.3 Permissive Parking and Loading Spaces
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to
serve any existing buildings or uses of land as long as such facilities fully comply with the provisions
of this Chapter, except that off-street parking areas accessory to existing multiple-family structures
may not be located off the premises containing the main use, unless on adjacent land.
9.3.4 Damage or Destruction
Any legal conforming building, structure or use in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance
which is subsequently damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, or other causes may be reconstructed,
re-established or repaired with or without off-street parking or loading facilities, except that parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be
restored or continued in operation. It shall not be necessary, however, to restore or maintain parking
or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Ordinance for equivalent new construction.
9.3.5 Computation of Spaces
When determination of the number of off-street parking and/or loading spaces required by this
Chapter results in a requirement for a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be
disregarded and any fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space or loading
space.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 9.3
9.4 Joint Parking Facilities
A. Off-street parking facilities for more than one building, structure, or use may be combined
and provided collectively in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use are permitted. When such combined parking is provided, the overall number
of parking spaces may be reduced by ten (10) percent.
B. For joint parking facilities for separate uses having non-overlapping and non-conflicting
parking demands, the required number of spaces for both uses may be reduced by up to thirty
(30) percent. Such a reduction shall be approved only if the Community Development
Director determines that the reduction will not result in increased congestion or violate the
purpose and intent of this Chapter.
9.5 Off-Site Parking Facilities
When required off-street parking is provided on a lot or parcel other than that occupied by the
principal use, it shall be under the same possession or control, either by deed or long-term lease, as
the property occupied by the principal use. The owner of the principal use shall be bound by a
covenant filed with the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds requiring the owner and the owner’s
heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking spaces during the existence of the
principal use, except as permitted herein.
9.6 Use of Parking Facilities
A. All parking, storage and display-for-sale of passenger vehicles, motorcycles, commercial
vehicles, recreational vehicles, trailers and intermodal containers in any district shall be on an
improved paved surface, except as provided for elsewhere in this Ordinance. (Ordinance
Number 09-O-64, adopted October 20, 2009).
B. Major vehicle repair, alteration, or maintenance is prohibited in parking facilities located in
all zoning districts.
C. On property which is residentially used or zoned, parking areas shall be used in accordance
with the provisions of this Chapter and solely for the parking of motor vehicles owned by
occupants of the dwellings to which such parking areas are accessory or by guests of said
occupants. Required parking areas accessory to residential structures shall not be used for the
storage of commercial vehicles or the parking of motor vehicles belonging to employees,
owners, tenants, visitors, or customers of business, office, or manufacturing establishments.
The parking, standing, or storage of semi-trailers, semi-tractors, farm machinery, tractors, and
intermodal containers is prohibited in all residential zoning districts, except as provided for
herein. No semi-trailer, trailer or any other motor vehicle or intermodal container may be
used as an accessory structure in any zoning district except as provided for in Section 9.6.D.
D. On property within business districts, semi-trailers and intermodal containers may be stored
only in an approved loading area and for no more than 1 month. Trailers used for temporary
storage during a construction project may be stored only for the duration of the construction
project and must be issued a temporary use permit. Motor vehicle storage, display for sale,
repair work and service of any kind, except for emergency repairs, shall be prohibited within
any required open off-street parking area.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 9.4
E. On property within manufacturing districts, semi-trailers and intermodal containers shall not
be stored for more than 6 months within any 12 month period. Trailers used for temporary

9.9 Land Banked Parking Facilities
A. Land Banking Authorized. Except as permitted
elsewhere in this Chapter, the Community
Development Director may authorize up to 30 percent
of the required off-street parking spaces in a multiplefamily,
commercial, or industrial zoning district, or
for a non-residential use in a residential district, to be
left as open space which can be readily converted to
parking facilities (“Land Bank”). Such authorization
shall occur during the project review process and shall
be depicted on a required Parking Land Bank Plan.
During the planned unit development approval
process, the Plan Commission may approve the land
banking of up to 35 percent of the parking spaces
required for a planned unit development.
The parking facilities to be constructed and the Land Bank, if converted to parking spaces,
must comply with the off-street parking facility requirements of this Chapter at the time the
Parking Land Bank Plan is approved. In all cases, the establishment of land banked spaces
must be acknowledged in required site engineering plans, and stormwater management
systems must be designed and constructed to accommodate all land banked spaces.
B. Land Bank Plan Required. The owner of the property making a land bank request shall
submit a required Parking Land Bank Plan for review and approval by the City Engineer.
The Parking Land Bank Plan shall show both full compliance with the parking regulations of
this Chapter and the land bank area, and shall depict the reduced number of parking spaces
and interim use of the land banked area.
C. Termination of the Land Bank. The City shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its
sole and absolute discretion to require a property owner or successor, at any time to construct
all or a portion of the land banked parking facilities, with the Community Development
Director providing notice to the Owner that the land banked parking facilities must be
constructed and completed within one-hundred-eighty (180) days from the date of said notice.
Commentary:
The land banking of parking spaces allows for a deferral of the installation of required parking spaces when it
is determined that a proposed use will not need the number of spaces otherwise stipulated in this Ordinance.
For example, a residential development which serves elderly or challenged individuals may not initially need
the number of parking spaces required by Table 9.1. However, if the overall demographic characteristic of the
development changes and additional parking is needed, the development has been designed to
accommodate the additional parking and it can be installed when needed.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 9.8
9.10 Parking Space Design
A. Except for parallel parking spaces and handicap parking spaces, required off-street parking
spaces shall be a minimum of 18 feet in length by 9 feet in width, exclusive of access drives, driving
aisles, ramps, or similar obstructions. At least 16 feet of the parking space length shall be paved,
while the remaining 2 feet of length shall be either paved or provided in the form of a curb overhang.
The curb overhang may be located within a required side or rear yard setback. If the overhang is
provided over a sidewalk, then the sidewalk shall have an additional width of 2 feet. Each off-street
parking space parallel to a parking aisle or driveway shall be no less than 10 feet wide and 23 feet in
length.
B. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such
width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space.

space or for parking spaces on a thirty (30) degree or forty-five degree
(45o) angle to the aisle.
 Twenty (20) feet for parking spaces on a 60 degree angle to the aisle;
 Twenty-five (25) feet for perpendicular parking spaces on a 90 degree angle.
C. The width of each parking module, i.e., the combined width of the driving aisle and the
abutting parking area, shall not be less than the following, unless modified by the City Engineer:
 Thirty-four (34) feet for parallel parking spaces;
 Fifty (50) feet for parking spaces on a thirty-degree angle from the aisle;
 Fifty-four (54) feet for parking spaces on a forty-five-degree angle from the aisle;

Stacking for queuing spaces accessory to drive-in or
drive-thru facilities shall have a minimum width of 10
feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, and shall form a
single line. Such spaces shall be located so as not to
interfere with parking or pedestrian movement and
vehicular circulation on the zoning lot or on adjacent
public streets, and shall comply with the setback
restrictions of Section 9.12.C herein. Such stacking
shall not obstruct ingress or egress to the site, shall not
obstruct access to required parking spaces or loading
spaces, and shall not unduly interfere with pedestrian
movement. Such spaces shall not occupy the same
spaces as parking or aisles thereto.
9.11 Access
A. Parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate vehicular access from a lot or parcel to a
street or alley. Except as provided for in this Ordinance, no driveway or curb cut in any district shall

established building line for properties in the same block, or (b) the front yard setback line
required in the underlying zoning district. Further, any wall or fence around a parking area
shall be subject to the same street setback requirements as a building or structure. Where the
dedication of additional right-of-way is necessary, required parking setbacks may be
calculated from the original right of way line, however in no case may parking be located
within 20 feet of the new right of way line.
B. No parking space or portion thereof, and/or paving for parking areas and driving aisles, on the
same zoning lot as a building, on land zoned or used for residential activity, is permitted
within a required front yard or side yard abutting a street. However, parking in a driveway is
permitted in the front yard and side yard setbacks for any single family detached dwelling
unit or any single family attached dwelling unit within a residential district, with a maximum

the City Engineer.
G. Connections between parking areas and lots serving different principal uses or parcels shall
be provided to allow vehicles to travel among adjacent commercial or office uses. Crossaccess
easement declarations or other recordable documents shall be utilized. The City
Engineer may waive this requirement where interconnections are not possible due to grade
changes at property lines, physical obstructions on neighboring properties, or similar physical
impediments, or where such interconnections are not practical or legally possible.
9.14 Landscaping
A. When new off-street parking for 20 or more vehicles is provided, or when an existing parking

2. Landscape areas located externally. An area no more than 10 feet from the edge
of the paved surface may be considered part of the required landscape area. Shade or
ornamental trees shall be no more than 50 feet apart and at least 50 percent of the total
perimeter landscape area shall have plant materials such as dwarf shrubs, compact
evergreens, or hedge materials including but not limited to intermediate shrubs or upright
compact evergreens. Annuals or perennial ground cover may be incorporated into these beds.
Foundation plantings or ground sign plantings are not part of the required external landscape
area. The location of landscape materials in public right of way must be approved by the City
Engineer.
3. Condition of plant materials. All plant materials serving a parking lot shall be
maintained in a healthy condition and shall be pruned to maintain visibility between a height
of 3 feet and 7 feet, except where the lack of such visibility does not create a hazard to drivers

10.1 Requirement for Final Plat Approval
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development,
each subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate land for park, recreational, fire/rescue, police,
library and school purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or
shall be required to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at
the option of the City with the concurrence of the affected district or districts, which concurrence shall be
obtained in writing. However, the City shall have the final decision making power in this regard. Further,
as a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or a final plat of a planned unit development, each
subdivider or developer shall be required to make a cash contribution for streets, sanitary sewer and potable
water as provided in this Chapter. In the case of a commercial or industrial development, a cash potable
water capital improvement contribution and sanitary sewer capital improvement contribution to serve the
immediate and future potable water system and sanitary sewer system of the City is required. The
contributions required hereunder shall be made in accordance with the criteria and formulas as provided
herein.
10.2 Criteria for Requiring Park and Recreational Land Dedication
A. Requirement and Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear
directly on the amount of land required for dedication for park and recreational purposes. The
total requirement shall be 14 acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate population and may be allocated
by the City Council at its discretion based upon the following criteria:
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.2
Type of Recreation Area Minimum Size Park Acreage per 1,000 People
Play lot & neighborhood park 2 acres 2 acres
City-wide park for active
sports
10 acres 6 acres
City-wide recreation park 15 acres 6 acres
TOTAL 14 acres of land per 1,000 people
These requirements for acreage are based upon studies performed by the City, the Illinois
Recreational Facilities Inventory, by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, previous
practices of the City, and a review of available data studies and literature on the subject. These
requirements are presumed to be the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in
calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided
herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in
accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Parks and Recreation Commission. Failure to timely
object to these acreage requirements in accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall thereafter
waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. (Ordinance Number 13-O-43, adopted August
20, 2013).
B. Location: Park and recreation planning documents adopted by the City Council or as set forth in
the City's comprehensive planning documents shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A
central location that will serve equally the entire development or a location that is adjacent to
existing park and recreational land is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be
located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances.
C. Credit for Private Open Spaces and Recreation Areas:
1. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in
subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the sole option of the City Council, be
provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space. The
extent of the space shall be determined by the City Council based on the needs of the
projected residents and the amount of total park and recreation land for the general area.
2. When subdividers or developers provide private open space for recreation areas and
facilities, it may have the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational
services. Since private open space is not available to the general public of the City, it is
the policy of the City that private open space may be discounted by at least 50 percent or
more at the discretion of the City Council. The actual discount shall be determined based
on factors such as, but not limited to: the scale, nature and location of the private open
space and the benefit to be provided.
3. In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a
substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreation facilities
and equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas,
including specifications of facilities and equipment to be installed, must be approved by
the City. Before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or
developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently
maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. When an
adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the
total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned
development and then subtract the credit to be given.
10.3 Criteria for Requiring School Site Dedication
A. Requirement and Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be generated by a
subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required to be
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.3
dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the
ratio of the (a) estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the (b)
maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as
stated herein, and then applying such ratio to (c) the appropriate number of acres for a school site
of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land
deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of
children in each such school classification.
B. School Classifications and Size of School Site: These requirements for acreage are based upon a
review of available data studies and literature on the subject, including, but not limited to,
information provided by the State Superintendent of Education and the unique characteristics of
McHenry County, including the general rural character and open space, and the desire of its
residents to maintain this character and open space in future school sites. These requirements for
acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating
any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided herein.
Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in
accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Plan Commission. Failure to timely object to these
acreage requirements in accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall thereafter waive any right to
raise an objection at a later time.
School classifications and size of school sites within the City shall be determined in accordance
with the following criteria:
School Classification
by Grades
Maximum Number
of Students for Each
Such School
Classification
Appropriate Number of
Acres of Land for Each
School Site of Such
Classification

or 7th and 8th grades
600 students
35 acres
17.14 students
High school: Grades
9th through 12th
1,500 students 90 acres 16.67 students
C. Location: The Comprehensive School Plan and/or the standards adopted by the school district
shall be used as a guideline for locating school sites.
10.4 Criteria for Requiring Police Site Dedication
A. Requirement and Population Ratio: New developments and increased population create new
demands for police protection. They create the need for additional police facilities. The ultimate
density of a proposed development shall bear directly on the amount of land required for
dedication. The City hereby finds that the total requirement shall be 1.5 acres of land per 1,000 of
ultimate population. These requirements are based upon a review of available data, studies and
literature on the subject, as well as the City's own internal examination of police utilization and
needs. They shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in
calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided
herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in
accordance with Section 10.16 herein. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in
accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a
later time.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.4
B. Location: The location of any new police facility shall be determined by the City. However,
preference will be given to those sites centrally located within the development, allowing for the
most efficient utilization of police services.
10.5 Criteria for Requiring Library Site Dedication
A. Requirement and Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear
directly on the amount of land required for dedication. New development and increased population
create greater demands for adequate and efficient library services to meet the educational, cultural
and recreational needs of the citizenry. They create the need for additional library facilities. The
City hereby finds that the total requirement shall be one acre of land per 1,000 of ultimate
population.
These requirements are based upon a review of available data, studies and literature on the subject,
as well as the City's own internal examination of library utilization and needs. They shall be
presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu
of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to these
acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in accordance with Section
10.16 herein. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in accordance with Section
10.16 herein shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
B. Location: The location of any new library facility shall be determined by the City. However,
preference will be given to those sites centrally located within the development, allowing for the
most efficient utilization of library services.
10.6 Criteria for Requiring Fire/Rescue Site Dedication
A. Requirement and Population Ratio: New developments and increased population create new
demands for fire/rescue services. They create the need for additional fire/rescue, firehouse and
training sites. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly on the amount of
land required for dedication. The City hereby finds that the total requirement shall be 5 acres of
land per 10,000 of ultimate population. This requirement is based upon a review of available data
as well as the fire/rescue districts own internal examination of fire/rescue utilization and needs.
They shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating
any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided herein.
Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in
accordance with Section 10.16 herein. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in
accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a
later time.
B. Location: The location of any new fire/rescue house and training site shall be determined by the
Woodstock Fire/Rescue District in consultation with the City. However, preference will be given
to those sites centrally located within the development, allowing for the most efficient utilization
of fire/rescue services.
10.7 Criteria for Requiring Cash Contribution in Lieu of Park, Fire/Rescue, School, Police, and
Library Sites
A. When the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the
available land is inappropriate for park, recreational, fire/rescue, police, library and school
purposes or is in conflict with the approved Comprehensive School Plan, the City, with the
concurrence of the appropriate district, if applicable, shall require the subdivider or developer to
pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication.
B. The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the
City or other public body designated by the City and shall be used solely for the acquisition of
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.5
park and recreation land as classified in Section 10.2 herein, which will be available to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the
improvement of other existing local park and recreation lands that already serve such needs or for
any other lawful park purpose or for any park purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at
the time of platting.
C. The cash contributions in lieu of fire/rescue sites shall be held in trust by the City or other public
body designated by the City. Said contributions shall be used for the acquisition of land for fire
house and training sites to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of that
subdivision or development or for the improvement of any other existing fire house or training site
that already serves such needs or for any other lawful fire/rescue purpose or for any fire/rescue
purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting.
D. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the City or other public
body designated by the City. Said contributions shall be used for the acquisition of land for
school sites to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or
development or for the improvement to any existing school site that already serves such needs,
which includes school buildings or other infrastructure necessitated and specifically and uniquely
attributable to the development or subdivision in question.
E. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedication or cash
contribution in lieu of school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein
within 13 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the record owner of the subdivided
land at the time of the refund. If there is more than one record owner of the subdivided land or of
the land that comprises the planned unit development, as applicable, such record owners shall
share in the refund pro-rata based on the fees originally paid by each property.
F. The cash contribution in lieu of police site dedication shall be held in trust by the City or other
public body as designated by the City and shall be used for the acquisition of police land as
required herein to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or
development or for the improvement of existing or proposed police facilities that already serve or
will serve such needs or for any other lawful purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at
the time of platting.
G. If any portion of the cash contribution in lieu of police site dedication is not expended for the
purposes set forth herein within 13 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the
record owner of the subdivided land at the time of refund. If there is more than one record owner
of the subdivided land or of the land that compromises the planned unit development, such record
owners shall share in the refund pro-rata based on the fees originally paid by each property.
H. The cash contribution in lieu of library site dedication shall be held in trust by the City or other
public body as designated by the City and shall be used for the acquisition of library land as
required herein, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of
that subdivision or development or for the improvement of existing or proposed library facilities
that already serve or will serve such needs or for any other lawful purpose agreed to by the
subdivider or developer at the time of platting.
I. If any portion of the cash contribution in lieu of library land dedication is not expended for the
purposes set forth herein within 13 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the record
owner of the subdivided land at the time of refund. If there is more than one record owner of the
subdivided land or of the land that compromises the planned unit development, such record
owners shall share in the refund pro-rata based on the fees originally paid by each property.
J. Fair Market Value for Park and Recreation: The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on
the “fair market value” of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and
recreation sites. The “fair market value” on a per acre basis, shall be based on the assumption
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.6
unless determined otherwise pursuant to Section 10.16 herein, that the land is zoned single-family
residential, subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated road, stubbed with City sanitary
sewer and potable water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved as set forth in Sections
10.14 and 10.15 herein, and is otherwise property capable of being used for single-family
residential development. Based on data available from the McHenry County Assessor’s Office and
upon an examination of real estate transactions in Woodstock it has been determined that the
present “fair market value” of such improved land in and surrounding the City is, as of the
effective date of this Chapter, $67,340.00 per acre. This figure shall be adjusted by the City
Council from time to time. The “fair market value” as defined herein shall be used in calculating
any cash in lieu of land contribution unless timely objected to as provided in Section 10.16 herein
or unless otherwise provided herein. Objections to the “fair market value” as defined herein shall
be made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Plan Commission. (Ordinance Number
13-O-43, adopted August 20, 2013).
K. Fair Market Value for Fire/Rescue Sites: The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on
the “fair market value” of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as a
fire/rescue site. The “fair market value,” on a per acre basis, shall be based on the assumption
unless determined otherwise pursuant to Section 10.16 herein, that the land is zoned single-family
residential, subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated road, stubbed with City sanitary
sewer and potable water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved as set forth in Sections
10.14 and 10.15 herein, and is otherwise property capable of being used for single-family
residential development. Based on data available from the McHenry County Assessor’s Office and
upon an examination of real estate transactions in Woodstock it has been determined that the
present “fair market value” of such improved land in and surrounding the City is, as of the
effective date of this Chapter, $90,000.00 per acre. This figure shall be adjusted by the City
Council from time to time. The “fair market value” as defined herein shall be used in calculating
any cash in lieu of land contribution unless timely objected to as provided in Section 10.16 herein
or unless otherwise provided herein. Objections to the “fair market value” as defined herein shall
be made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Plan Commission. (Ordinance Number
13-O-43, adopted August 20, 2013).
L. Fair Market Value for Schools: The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the “fair
market value” of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as school sites. The
“fair market value,” on a per acre basis, shall be based on the assumption unless determined
otherwise pursuant to Section 10.16 herein, that the land is zoned single-family residential,
subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated road, stubbed with City sanitary sewer and
potable water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved as set forth in Sections 10.14 and
10.15 herein, and is otherwise property capable of being used for single-family residential
development. Based upon a study of real estate transactions in Woodstock it has been determined
that the present “fair market value” of such improved land in and surrounding the City is, as of the
effective date of this Chapter, $90,000.00 per acre. This figure shall be adjusted by the City
Council from time to time. The “fair market value” as defined herein shall be used in calculating
any cash in lieu of land contribution unless timely objected to as provided in Section 10.16 herein
or unless otherwise provided herein. Objections to the fair market value as defined herein shall be
made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Plan Commission. (Ordinance Number 13-O-
43, adopted August 20, 2013).
M. Fair Market Value for Police and Library Sites: The City currently has an existing library and
police station. Any expansion of these two buildings will occur in downtown Woodstock. The
City has determined that the cost of land in downtown Woodstock and the immediate vicinity is
$90,000.00 per acre. The price per acre figure for all calculations pursuant to this Chapter 10 for
library and/or police purposes shall be $90,000 per acre. This figure shall be adjusted by the City
Council from time to time. The “fair market value” as defined herein shall be used in calculating
any cash in lieu of land contribution unless timely objected to as provided in Section 10.16 herein
or unless otherwise provided herein. Objections to the “fair market value” as defined herein shall
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.7
be made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Plan Commission. (Ordinance Number
13-O-43, adopted August 20, 2013).
N. Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee: There will be situations in subdivisions or planned
unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are
necessary. These occasions will arise when (a) only a portion of the land to be developed is
proposed as the location for a park, police, library or school site (that portion of the land within the
subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as stated herein,
and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have
been required to be dedicated); or (b) a major part of the local park, police site, library site or
school site has already been acquired by the City or school district and only a small portion of land
is needed from the development to complete the site (the remaining portion shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof for the rest of the required land shall be
required).
10.8 Criteria for Requiring Streets Contribution
The development of new subdivisions and planned unit developments creates a proportional increase in the
traffic utilizing City streets and highways. This requires the expansion of the existing infrastructure as well
as the creation of new and existing roadways to satisfy the increased traffic congestion. Demographic
studies demonstrate the clear relationship between increased development and increased traffic congestion,
necessitating expansion of the infrastructure. Demographic studies show that all residential units contain
on average two adults. Given the rural nature of the City the average residential unit in the City owns two
automobiles. Each developer or subdivider shall pay a cash contribution of $100.00 to the City per required
off-street parking space or portion thereof.
This requirement is based upon a review of available data, studies and literature on the subject, as well as
the City's own internal examination of street utilization and requirements. It shall be presumed to be correct
and accurate and shall be used in calculating cash contributions herein unless timely objected to as
provided herein. Objections to this Section shall be made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein. Failure
to timely object to these requirements in accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall thereafter waive any
right to raise an objection at a later time.
The cash contribution shall be held in trust by the City or other public body designated by the City and
shall be used solely for the expansion or modification of the City's street system so as to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of
other existing streets that already serve such needs or for any other lawful purposes or for any purpose
agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting. If any portion of a cash contribution is not
expended within 13 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the record owner of the
subdivided land at the time of the refund. If there is more than one record owner of the subdivided land or
of the land that comprises the planned unit development, as applicable, such record owners shall share in
the refund pro-rata based on the fees originally paid by each property.
10.9 Criteria for Requiring Cash Potable Water Capital Improvement Contribution
The development of new subdivisions and planned unit developments increases the demands upon the
existing potable water service provided by the City in a proportionate and ascertainable manner. Studies of
the volume of existing potable water use and the current capacity to meet that use reveal the need to
develop additional potable water service capabilities. Therefore, each new developer or subdivider desiring
to connect to the City’s potable water supply shall pay a capital improvement contribution, also referred to
as a water connection fee, pursuant to Section 6.4D.1 of the Woodstock City Code (as amended from time
to time).
These requirements are based upon a review of available data, studies and literature on the subject, as well
as the City's own internal examination of potable water utilization and requirements. They shall be
presumed to be correct and accurate and shall be used in calculating cash contributions herein unless timely
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.8
objected to as provided herein. Objections to this Section shall be made in accordance with Section 10.16
herein. Failure to timely object to these requirements in accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall
thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
The cash contribution for potable water capital improvement shall be held in trust by the City or other
public body designated by the City and shall be used solely for the expansion or modification of the City’s
potable water system so as to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or
development or for the improvement of the existing potable water system that already serves such needs or
for any other lawful purposes or for any purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of
platting. If any portion of a cash contribution is not expended within 13 years from the date of receipt, it
shall be refunded to the record owner of the subdivided land at the time of the refund. If there is more than
one record owner of the subdivided land or of the land that comprises the planned development, as
applicable, such record owners shall share in the refund pro-rata based on the fees originally paid by each
property.
10.10 Criteria for Requiring Cash Sanitary Sewer Capital Improvement Contribution
The development of new subdivisions and planned unit developments increases the demands upon the
existing sanitary sewer services provided by the City in a proportionate and ascertainable manner. Studies
of the volume of existing sewage use and the current capacity to meet that use reveal the need to develop
additional sewage service capabilities. Therefore, each new developer or subdivider desiring to connect to
the City's sanitary sewer system shall pay a capital improvement contribution, also referred to as a sewer
connection fee, pursuant to Section 6.4D.2 of the Woodstock City Code (as amended from time to time).
These requirements are based upon a review of available data, studies and literature on the subject, as well
as the City’s own internal examination of sanitary sewer system utilization and requirements. They shall be
presumed to be correct and accurate and shall be used in calculating cash contributions herein unless timely
objected to as provided herein. Objections to this Section shall be made in accordance with Section 10.16
herein. Failure to timely object to these requirements in accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall
thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
This cash contribution shall be held in trust by the City or other public body designated by the City and
shall be used solely for the expansion or modification of the City’s sanitary sewer system so as to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of the
existing sanitary sewer system that already serves such needs or for any other lawful purposes or for any
purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting. If any portion of a cash
contribution is not expended within 13 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the record
owner of the subdivided land at the time of the refund. If there is more than one record owner of the
subdivided land or of the land that comprises the planned development, as applicable, such record owners
shall share in the refund pro-rata based on the fees originally paid by each property.
10.11 Density Formula
The table, which is subject to revision from time to time by the City, contained in Exhibit 10.C herein
constitutes projections of anticipated population density and is generally indicative of current and shortrange
projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of
required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is
filed thereto by the subdivider or developer pursuant to Section 10.16 herein.
The term “bedroom” as used herein shall include any den, study or extra room located on any floor in a
dwelling unit which is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose such as a kitchen (one per
unit), dining room (one per unit), living room (one per unit), bathroom and family room (one per unit). In
addition, any room that is not a kitchen, dining room or bathroom, which is sectioned off from the
remainder of the house by a door or doors, is presumed to be a bedroom.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.9
Exhibit 10.C, as updated, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution unless objected
to as provided in Section 10.16 herein. The City recognizes that Exhibit 10.C may be updated from time to
time and will, as a result, continually adopt these updates periodically by amending this Chapter 10
accordingly. Objections to the table shall be made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein to the Plan
Commission. Failure to object to the figures in Exhibit 10.C in accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall
thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the Exhibit 10.C figures, he shall submit
his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the
subdivision or planned development, and in that event final determination of the density formula shall be
made in accordance with Section 10.16 herein.
Commentary
The amount of cash required in lieu of a land donation in order to fulfill school, park, library,
police, and fire/rescue impact obligations is based on (1) the estimated population per
dwelling unit, (2) the amount of land for a new school, park, library, police station, or
fire/rescue station site required per person, (3) the number acres of land per dwelling unit,
and (4) land value.
The estimated number of people per dwelling unit is multiplied by the number of acres of
land required per person in order to arrive at the number of acres of land required per
dwelling unit. The number of acres per dwelling unit is multiplied by the per acre value of
the land to determine the cash in lieu of land fee. For school impact fees, figures are
obtained for elementary school, middle school, and high school sites, then added together
to arrive at the total school cash in lieu of land fee.
10.12 Reservation of Additional Land
When the Comprehensive Plan or the standards of the City call for a larger amount of park and recreational
land or school sites in a particular subdivision or planned development than the developer is required to
dedicate pursuant to this Chapter 10, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be set aside
and reserved by the developer for subsequent acquisition by the City or other public body designated by the
City, provided that such acquisition is made within five years from the date of approval of the final plat.
10.13 Combining with Adjoining Developments
Where appropriate, public open space or a school site that is to be dedicated should, if possible, be
combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas and/or
school sites without undue hardship on a particular developer.
10.14 Topography and Grading
The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for its
intended purpose. Wetlands and flood plains may be accepted for City ownership and maintenance, but
shall not serve as a credit toward the park site contribution. Storm water detention areas shall not be
accepted for City ownership and maintenance, and the portion of a detention area designed to function
primarily as a component of the storm water control system shall not serve as a credit toward the required
park site contribution. Retention areas shall not be accepted for City ownership and maintenance and shall
not serve as a credit toward the required park site contribution. A park site shall be not less than one acre in
area. Wetlands, flood plains, detention areas, retention areas and areas of steep slope shall not be accepted
as school, police and library sites and shall not serve as a credit toward the required cash in lieu of land
contribution.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.10
10.15 Improved Sites
All sites, with the exception of park and recreation land, shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full
service of electric, natural gas, potable water, sanitary sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and
curb and gutter), as applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements
of the Woodstock City Code and this Unified Development Ordinance. Landscaping normally included
within the definition of "improved" sites under this Ordinance may be deleted due to the delay time
between dedication of any such school site and the construction of school facilities thereon.
10.16 Objections
A. All objections relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair market value, Exhibit C
herein or any other application of this Chapter 10 to a particular subdivision or planned
development, shall first be referred to the Plan Commission for hearing. Any objection relating to
acreage requirements for park and recreation purposes shall also be referred to the Parks and
Recreation Commission for its consideration. An objection must be made, if at all, prior to the
approval by the City of the final plat. A failure to object by such time shall constitute a waiver of
the right to object to the provisions of this Chapter 10. All developers submitting a plat of
subdivision or resubdivision or a plat of a planned unit development to the City shall be given a
copy of these regulations, including the procedures for objecting to such an assessment as
prescribed by this Section 10.16. Upon receipt of said Ordinance, the developer shall sign an

approval. In calculating the fee or cash contributions at the time of platting, the City will assume the
maximum density permitted under the zoning classification approved pursuant to the Table of Estimated
Population attached as Exhibit 10.C. For example, if the subdivision in question is zoned single family,
the City will assume for purposes of calculating fees and cash contributions payable pursuant to this
Chapter that all houses will have five bedrooms. At the time a building permit is issued for a house having
less than five bedrooms, the City shall issue a refund for any cash contribution overpayments.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.14
For any lot which received final plat approval prior to the enactment of this Section and which remains
vacant at the time this Section is enacted, all dedications, fees and cash contributions imposed herein shall
be due and payable at the time a building permit is issued.
The City may agree that payment of fees and cash contributions be made at the time of building permit
issuance in consideration of which the subdivider or developer shall execute an agreement, which is Exhibit
10.B of this Section, agreeing that the fees and cash contributions payable will be adjusted in accordance
with the requirements of this Chapter, and further agreeing that the fees and cash contributions may be
expended for the purposes described in said Exhibit 10.B and agreeing to accept the validity of this
Ordinance and the fees as calculated. In the event the City agrees to delay the payment of fees and cash
contributions required under this Chapter, to the time of building permit issuance, the fees and cash
contributions owed shall be those which are in effect at the time the building permit is issued. This
agreement or memorandum thereof shall be recorded along with the final plat of subdivision upon approval
by the City. At the time of payment, the subdivider or developer shall receive a copy of this Chapter and
shall execute an acknowledgment that said copy has been received. The executed acknowledgment shall be
kept on file by the City evidencing proof of land dedication or payment of cash contributions in lieu of land
dedication by each subdivider or developer.
10.22 Miscellaneous
A. In calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution payable at time of issuance of building permit,
the City shall use the fair market value as set forth herein or any amendment thereto and in effect
at the time of the contribution and building permit issuance.
B. The City recognizes the fact that developments may differ in their impact upon a community.
Consequently, the City reserves the right to negotiate dedications that differ from those contained
in this Ordinance when annexing property to the City pursuant to an annexation agreement.
C. Previously approved final plats of subdivision shall be subject to all fees and dedications required
by this Section. The required fees shall be paid and required dedications conveyed to the City by
the applicant for a building permit prior to the issuance of a building permit.
D. Land Value Adjustment: The fees and cash contributions required herein shall be subject to a
“land value adjustment” which shall be calculated as a percentage of the change in annual
residential equalized assessed value based on township assessor data and evaluations. Annually, or
on a regular basis determined by the City Council, the fees and cash contributions shall be
adjusted by said percentage. Such adjustment shall be rounded in $1.00 increments and be used to
adjust the fees and cash contributions required in this chapter. Said adjustments shall become
effective on the fifteenth (15) day of January, or as soon as possible thereafter, of each year. The
fees and cash contributions shall be presumed to be correct and accurate unless timely objected to
as provided in Section 10.16 herein. Failure to timely object to these requirements in strict
accordance with Section 10.16 herein shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a
later time. (Ordinance Number 13-O-43, adopted August 20, 2013).

AGREEMENT REGARDING THE RECEIPT OF DEVELOPER
SUBDIVISION CONTRIBUTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
WHEREAS, the City of Woodstock, Illinois, on behalf of itself, its officers, employees
and independent contractors (the "City"), through its ordinances or through the provisions of its
annexation agreements has required that developers make contributions to the City, that the City,
in turn, may make available for itself and/or other government bodies that are affected by the
subdivision improvements; and
WHEREAS, such contributions may be in land or in money and, when transferred or paid
over to those government bodies, inure in part to the benefit of those government bodies and not
entirely to the direct benefit of the City; and
WHEREAS, from time to time within the City, and within other municipalities, disputes
have arisen regarding the validity and amount of such contributions; and
WHEREAS, the City is willing, at its discretion, to continue seeking the contribution of
land or money but wishes to procure a commitment from other government bodies benefited by
the receipt of such contributions that those government bodies will (a) acknowledge that the
requirement that such subdivision contributions be made are totally within the discretion of the
City as to their existence, manner and amount; (b) pay the cost of defending any lawsuit that is
filed challenging the appropriate amount of the contributions, the time at which they are to be
made or any other aspect of the contributions; and (c) will comply with the terms of a final and
non-appealable judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction rendered in connection
with the lawsuit; and
WHEREAS, the City is willing, in its discretion, to pay over or require contributions only
to other government bodies that execute this Agreement annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the payment of money or the transfer of the
land to the Benefiting Government, which the City from time to time may within its discretion
cause to be made by developers that are subdividing property, it is agreed between the City, on
behalf of itself and its officers, employees and independent contractors, and
, a government body within the State of Illinois (the “Benefiting Government”) as
follows:
1. The Benefiting Government acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in
the City's ordinances and/or annexation agreements, the City is not obligated to cause the
payment of money or the transfer of land to the Benefiting Government. The Benefiting
Government recognizes that the City may, at its sole discretion, amend its ordinances or
annexation agreements or its practices to discontinue the payment of subdivision contributions to
the Benefiting Government.
2. Legal Representation and Costs:
A. In the event a lawsuit is filed against the City and/or the Benefiting Government by a
developer that is subdividing property or any other person, corporation or entity that challenges
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.16
the appropriateness, amount, timing or any other aspect of a subdivision contribution that,
pursuant to the terms of the City's ordinances or annexation agreements, has been paid or is due
to the Benefiting Government, then the Benefiting Government does agree to pay the costs and
litigation expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the City in defending such
lawsuit. The costs and expenses shall be paid by the Benefiting Government when and as incurred
by the City but in no event more than once a month. As a condition precedent to the payment of
these costs and expenses, the City shall submit to the Benefiting Government copies of the
original statements reflecting the costs and expenses, together with the non-privileged supporting
documentation that may be reasonably requested by the Benefiting Government.
B. The City covenants and agrees that it shall employ competent and skilled legal counsel to
represent the Benefiting Government and the City, and further covenants and agrees that it shall
keep the Benefiting Government fully advised as to the progress and status of the litigation. In
particular, the City shall provide to the Benefiting Government copies of all pleadings filed in the
litigation and shall consult regularly (and shall cause its attorneys to consult regularly) with the
Benefiting Government or its attorneys, as applicable, as to the strategy for defending the lawsuit.
In no event may such litigation be compromised or settled by the City without at least 30 days'
prior written notice to the Benefiting Government.
C. In the event the Benefiting Government decides that it would prefer to be represented in
the litigation by legal counsel of its own choosing, then the Benefiting Governmental shall be free
to retain its own legal counsel for that purpose, to intervene in the litigation and to ask the City to
terminate its representation to the Benefiting Government under Section 2 of this Agreement. The
Benefiting Government shall notify the City in writing to that effect. In that event, this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regarding all other provisions of this Agreement,
and the Benefiting Government shall remain liable to the City for all sums that have accrued
under this Agreement up until the date that such written notice is received and for all sums that
remain due and owing from the Benefiting Government to the City relating to the defense of any
lawsuit under the terms of this Agreement.
3. The Benefiting Government shall further indemnify and hold harmless the City
from any and all liability arising from Section 10.5 of the Unified Development Ordinance of the
City of Woodstock, Illinois, including but not limited to the general administration and handling
of funds required by the City and/or the Benefiting Government.
4. In the event a final and non-appealable judicial determination is made by a court
of competent jurisdiction that contributions of land or money received by the Benefiting
Government are, in whole or in part, excessive, the Benefiting Government shall promptly repay
to the person who procures such a judgment, together with all other amounts judged by the court
to be owning from the Benefiting Government. In the event a judicial determination should
require the payment of damages or payment of the attorneys’ fees of the plaintiff’s attorneys, the
Benefiting Government shall pay all additional amounts.
5. In further consideration of the continued payment by the City to the Benefiting
Government of the subject contributions of land or money, the Benefiting Government agrees that
its obligations under paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement shall extend to both past and future
cash and land contributions.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.17
6. On or before June 1st of each year, every Benefiting Government that receives
payments from the City under this Agreement shall submit a report to the City describing the
manner in which the payments have been used and provide any additional information the City
may require. When that money turned over to the Benefiting Government is to be used for a
specific purpose or within a specific time period, the report shall address those issues. If the
Benefiting Government should fail to file such a report with the City, the City may delay the
payment of any additional funds due the Benefiting Government until such time as a full report
containing adequate information is transmitted to the City. The Benefiting Government
understands that it will be asked to execute an indemnity agreement similar to this agreement on
an annual basis and that the City shall not pay any additional funds due to the Benefiting
Government until such time as the City is in receipt of such annually executed indemnity
agreement.
7. This Agreement shall be terminable by either party for any reason or no reason at
all upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party evidencing the intention to so terminate
this Agreement. But the termination of this Agreement shall not affect the continuing obligation
of the Benefiting Government or the City with regard to claims or damages allegedly arising out
of the City's efforts prior to termination to impose, collect or distribute contributions, or to the
actual distribution of subdivision contributions.

Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois - Page 10.18
EXHIBIT 10.B
AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND CITY
TO DELAY PAYMENT OF CASH CONTRIBUTIONS
The City of Woodstock (the "City") and , (“Developer”)
agree as follows:
A. The City has approved a final plat of subdivision or a final plat of a planned unit
development at the request of Developer for the real estate legally described in Exhibit 10.B.1
attached hereto and made a part hereof (the “Land”). Accordingly, pursuant to the Unified
Development Ordinance of the City of Woodstock, Illinois, (“Ordinance”), certain cash
contributions for lands are immediately due the City from the Developer.
B. Developer has, however, requested that the payment of the aforesaid cash
contributions be delayed and that the same become due and payable on a per dwelling unit basis
at time the City issues a building permit for the particular dwelling unit.
C. In consideration for the City agreeing to delay its receipt of the cash
contributions in accordance with Paragraph B above, Developer hereby agrees as follows:
1. The amount of cash contributions owed shall be calculated based upon Ordinance
No. _________ or as provided for in such other future ordinance amending or replacing
Ordinance No. _________ which is in effect at the time of the issuance of a building

Section 11.2 Definitions
For the purposes of this Ordinance 06-O-74, the following definitions shall be observed and applied:
11.2.1 Accessory Structure: A non-habitable structure which is on the same parcel of property as
the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
11.2.2 Act: An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the State of
Illinois", 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.
11.2.3 Applicant: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application.
11.2.4 Appropriate Use: Uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be
considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are as specified in Section 11.7.2.
11.2.5 Base Flood: The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year frequency flood event. Application of the
base flood elevation at any location is as defined in Section 11.5 of this Ordinance.
11.2.6 Base Flood Elevation (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the crest of the
base flood.
11.2.7 Basement: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on
all sides.
11.2.8 Building: A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank, that is
principally above ground, including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and gas or liquid
storage tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more
than 180 days per year.
11.2.9 Channel: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded
area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or man-made drainageway,
which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
11.2.10 Channel Modification: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or
materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring),
widening, deepening, straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the
bottom or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris,
or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form of channel modification involving a significant
change in the channel cross-section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.
straightening).
11.2.11 Compensatory Storage: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of
storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill or
structures are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can
increase off-site floodwater elevations and flows.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.3
11.2.12 Conditional Approval of a Designated Floodway Map Change: Preconstruction
by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval,
pursuant to this Part, gives assurances to the property owner that once an Appropriate Use is constructed
according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon review and
acceptance of as-built plans.
11.2.13 Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA will
revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an
effective Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, once the as-built plans are submitted
and approved.
11.2.14 Control Structure: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes through the
structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface elevation.
11.2.15 Critical Facility: Any facility critical to the health and welfare of the population, which if
flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the
delivery of vital services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can put special
populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required include:
emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and
senior care facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or
electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or
toxic substances). Examples of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
11.2.16 Dam: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their abutments and
appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing or diverting water or creating a pool.
Dams may also include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage
tanks are not included.
11.2.17 Designated Floodway: The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the
floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on the FEMA FIRM map, which is
needed to store and convey the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot
increase in stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10 percent increase in
velocities.
A. The floodways are designated for on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of McHenry
County prepared by FEMA and dated November 16, 2006. When two floodway maps exist for
a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
B. The floodways for those parts of unincorporated McHenry County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City that may be annexed into the City are designated for
Franklinville Creek, the Kishwaukee River, Silver Creek, and Slough Creek, on the
countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA and dated November 16, 2006.
C. To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary
should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference
marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location
of the designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
11.2.18 Development: Any man-made change to real estate, including:
A. Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building or any addition to a building.
B. Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home, or
installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days. If the travel
trailer or recreational vehicle is on site for more than 180 days, it must be fully licensed and

11.2.62 Start of Construction: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
11.2.63 Statewide Permits: Statewide permits are offered for pre-approved projects that are
considered minor projects which are permissible per the IDNR/OWR Part 3700 rules. A complete listing
of the statewide permits and permit requirements can be obtained from the IDNR/OWR website.
11.2.64 Structure: See Section 11.2.8 “Building”.
11.2.65 Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance, equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair
work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. The term
includes Repetitive Loss Buildings. See Section 11.2.56 “Repetitive Loss”.
11.2.66 Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of
a structure taking place subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance in which the cumulative percentage of
improvements equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or
repair is started. "Substantial Improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done. The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or
B. Any alteration of a “historic structure” listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the
Illinois Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure.
11.2.67 Transition Section: Reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a narrow
cross-section to a wide cross-section or vice versa.
11.2.68 Violation The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation
certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance is presumed to be in violation until such
time as that documentation is provided.

1. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which
will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of
excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
2. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due
to the fill or structure
3. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
4. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced
below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-
year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.

shall be at or above the Flood Protection Elevation (FPE).
11.6.3.C. The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum
distance of ten (10) feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site
conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the City Engineer may waive the
ten (10) foot minimum setback if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer certifies that
an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has
been met. Certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design
analysis, which shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review. The City Engineer may
require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter
setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback
distance be less than four (4) feet.
11.6.3.D. The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of twenty (20) feet

requirement cannot be obtained, the City Engineer may waive the twenty (20) foot
minimum setback distance if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer certifies that an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have
been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback
distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the
City for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four (4) feet.
11.6.3.E. The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this
subsection and is at least five (5) feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this
subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed
as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar
classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML
according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.
11.6.3.F. The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one
material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction.
11.6.3.G. All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois
Registered Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions.
11.6.3.H. The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five (5) below the BFE.
11.6.3.I. There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one quarter
(¼) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage
flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4) times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge
above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or
uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
11.6.3.J. The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow.
11.6.3.K. All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with

market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the
building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
11.7.2.B. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill,
building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to
accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping
or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined
above as an Appropriate Use.
11.7.2.C. Within the designated floodway , the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be considered
permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered
professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of
Section 11.9 of this Ordinance:
1. Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For
appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all
effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all
flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective
designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into
consideration:
a. Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n) (AR2/3) where "n" is Manning's
roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the
ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, Open Channel
Hydraulics, McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)).
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.19
b. The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed
conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local
unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the
land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover.
c. Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective
designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used
with the same efficiency:
i. When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for
every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
ii. When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for
every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
iii. When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one
foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used.
iv. Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid
expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
v. All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to
flood flows.
2. Preservation of Floodway Storage so as Not to Increase Downstream Flooding.
a. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost
due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the
impact of any related flood control projects.
b. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the
volume of floodplain storage lost.
c. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall
not be required to be replaced.
d. The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All
designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All designated floodway
storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the
proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
e. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a determination of
flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is
hydraulically equivalent.
f. There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.20
modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing
structure.
3. Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as Not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood
Heights
a. For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the
proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated
floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event.
b. In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by
the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
4. Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway Approaches
a. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages
greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage
increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical
extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of
existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements.
b. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1
feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or
waiver.
i. The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the
flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions
for the flood study specified in Section 11.5 of this Ordinance. Bridges and
Culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved
hydraulic models.
ii. Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per Section 11.7.2.C.2.
iii. Velocity increases must be mitigated per Section 11.7.2.C.3.
iv. If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or
commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
v. The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the
existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by Section 11.7.2.
vi. All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per
Section 11.7.2.C.8.
5. Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and Approach Roads
a. The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be
constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing
flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the
existing structure is not a source of flood damage.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.21
b. If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage
to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall
evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing
backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and
downstream properties.
c. The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood
damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Ill. Adm.
Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to
IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
6. On-Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water
a. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical
extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of
existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements.
b. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow.
c. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in Section 11.2.16 shall meet the
permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Construction and
Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the
channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated
that:
i. The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood
control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
ii. The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
iii. The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or
habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin.
iv. A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more
than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the
impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to
ensure comprehensive watershed control;
v. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 11.7.
7. Flood Proofing of Existing Habitable, Residential and Commercial Structures
a. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building,
the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further
than 10 feet from the outside of the building.
b. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.22
floodproofing activities.
8. Excavation in the Floodway
a. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings,
including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert
structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other Appropriate Uses,
transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
b. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's
engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests
that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
i. When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for
every four feet of the flooded stream's length; and
ii. When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for
every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and
iii. When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one
foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used; and
iv. Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of
the transition sections.
9. If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
a. There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its
purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected.
Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing
structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high
flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt.
Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions
and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
b. Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved
by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts
are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;
c. The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which
will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water
affected, consistent with the following criteria:
i. The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as
possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and
sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of
more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel
modification design, where practical.
ii. Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and
downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion.
iii. One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of
streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel,
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.23
where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the
vegetation.
iv. Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for
construction of the channel.
v. Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1
horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side
slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities
or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil
bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches.
Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be
avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
vi. All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or
otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction.
Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize
disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.
vii. If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep
pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the
new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible
with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate.
viii. A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification
to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality.
ix. New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of
construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of
water into the new channel.
x. There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves
the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood
control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat
improvement or erosion control project.
xi. Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no
reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result
of the modification; and
d. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 11.7.
10. Seeding and Stabilization Plan
For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be
submitted by the applicant.
11. Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Measures
For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which
there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
a. The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation
possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.24
unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed,
or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements.
b. Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as
soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days
after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded
areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than
60 days.
c. Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or
filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site
or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw
bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
d. A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished,
where possible, along existing channels (See 11.7.2.C.16).
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream
crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary
construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
e. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and
implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and
"The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
12. Public Flood Control Projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting
requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to
IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project
will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project
right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event.
a. The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study,
referenced in Section 11.5, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the
study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be
contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to
use.
b. If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed
construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a
larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet:
i. The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of
the designated floodway conditions; and
ii. Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.
c. If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a
downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed,
modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed,
constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall
be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the
existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge,
culvert or flood control project is built.
13. Conditional Letter of Map Revision
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, IL – Page 11.25
a If the Appropriate Use would result in a change in the designated floodway location
or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to
IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to
be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from
IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a
permit is issued.
b The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built
plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities
are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
c In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and
the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional
designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given.
d No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional
approval is issued.
e After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place
until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence
from IDNR/OWR.
14. Professional Engineer's Supervision.
All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered
professional engineer.
15. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the
following criteria shall be met:
a A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the
ordinary high water mark of the channel.
b Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an
Appropriate Use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of
construction.
16. After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of
a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, construction as necessary to change
the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other
construction that is not an Appropriate Use may be placed in that area until the
designated floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The
designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans.
11.7.2.D. Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State Review
For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance
of a permit by a community or county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway.

11.8.1.D. Preventing Increased Damages
1. No development in the SFHA where a floodway has not been determined shall create a
damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to
public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic
functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called
for in this Ordinance.
2. Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been determined, the following
standards shall apply:
a The developer shall have a Registered Professional Engineer state in writing and

The City Council’s response is typically provided on a response form which requests specific
information from the Council members and gives them the opportunity to comment on a proposed
annexation. The format of this form is as follows:
Preliminary Annexation Review Report
Sample City Council Response Form
This form is filled out by individual members of the Woodstock City Council in order to give the owner
and/or developer the initial reaction and opinion of the Council to a specific annexation and
development proposal. It provides an opportunity for Council members to initially comment on an
annexation and development proposal, without requiring the owner and/or developer to prepare and
submit a formal submittal. It also gives the Council members the ability to indicate what they believe
are the positive and negative features of the owner and/or developer’s request, and whether there is
initial support for the annexation. Responses and comments from individual City Council members are
not binding and that final approval of any annexation and/or development proposal requires formal
action by the City Council as a body.
This form should be completed by members of the City Council and returned to the City Manager within

13.12 Definitions
13.1 Purpose
This Chapter, hereinafter referred to as the "Sign Control Ordinance", creates a legal framework for
regulating signage.
The Sign Control Ordinance recognizes that outdoor signage places certain demands upon the
attention of people passing by, which cannot easily be ignored, set aside, or turned off at will as may
be done with other media. The Sign Control Ordinance also recognizes the need to protect the safety
and welfare of the public; the need to protect and enhance property values and to provide a strong
economic base by maintaining the attractive appearance and unique character of this community; the
need to protect people from assaults on their privacy and sensibilities; and the need to provide
adequate and effective identification and communication. The identity of businesses, the nature of the
business or manufacturing activity on a site, as well as directional instructions to pedestrian and
vehicular traffic on a site provide important information necessary for pleasant and effective
commerce between the public and business establishments.
13.2 Major Objectives
A. To provide safe passage for pedestrian and vehicular traffic by regulating location,
illumination, design components, construction, installation and maintenance.
B. To avoid sign clutter and minimize competition among neighboring signage by regulating the
number, size, location and illumination.
C. To preserve the character and unique appearance of the community by regulating new
signage, removing obsolete signage, and restricting certain types of signage.
D. To provide for legible signage by regulating the size and quantity of sign graphics while
taking into consideration the circumstances under which it is viewed and the limits of human
vision and comprehension.
E. To promote signage that is compatible with adjoining land uses, as well as the general
character of the area and/or zoning district in which the signage is located.

13.3 Historic Downtown Business Preservation District
The Historic Downtown Business Preservation District has a unique and historic character. Many of
the buildings located within this district are of an architectural design popular in the late nineteenth
century. This historic character is considered to be one of the most important assets of the District and
the City of Woodstock. It is the intent of this Chapter that this character be preserved. It is not the
intent of this Chapter to limit the effectiveness of signs within this district but to allow messages to be
conveyed more effectively and, at the same time, to preserve the historic character of the Historic
Downtown Business Preservation District.
In addition to the regulations contained herein, signs located within the Historic Downtown Business
Preservation District shall meet the following standards which are excerpted from the National Park
Service’s Preservation Brief # 25: The Preservation of Historic Signs:
A. Signs should be viewed as part of an overall graphics system for the building. They do not
have to do all the "work" by themselves. The building's form, name and outstanding features,
both decorative and functional, also support the advertising function of a sign. Signs should
work with the building, rather than against it.
B. New signs should respect the size, scale and design of the historic building. Features or
details of the building will suggest a motif for new signs.
C. Sign placement is important and new signs should not obscure significant features of the
historic building. Signs above a storefront should fit within the historic signboard, for
example.
D. New signs should respect neighboring buildings. They should not shadow or overpower
adjacent structures.
E. Sign materials should be compatible with those of the historic building. Materials
characteristic of the building's period and style, used in contemporary designs, can be used to
form effective new signs.
F. New signs should be carefully attached to the building to prevent damage to historic fabric
and to ensure pedestrian safety. Fittings should penetrate mortar joints rather than brick, for
example, and sign loads should be properly calculated and distributed.
The Historic Downtown Business District is depicted on the following map and is legally described in
Section 7.7.4.6 of the Woodstock City Code.
13.3.1 Historic Square Area
The Historic Square Area is located within the Historic Downtown Business Preservation District and
is comprised of properties located on the following streets: Johnson, Cass, Benton, Van Buren, Main,

pedestrians, not motorists. A sidewalk sign must not present an obstruction or risk to
public safety at any time.
A sidewalk sign may only be placed in front of the building in which the business is
located, provided that at least five feet of unobstructed sidewalk remains. The sign
must be placed within a foot of the wall of a building; however, the Building and
Zoning Director may approve an alternative location, based on the location of other
obstructions in the right of way.
A sign may not be attached to any other structure, sign, bench, planter, pole, bollard,
tree or other streetscape feature.
2. Number of signs: One sign may be displayed per business or per entrance, whichever
is less. If multiple businesses share a building entrance, they must share a sidewalk
sign. No other temporary sign may be displayed at the same time that a business is
displaying a sidewalk sign.
3. Use of signs: Sidewalk sign permits will only be granted to businesses, where
pedestrian traffic is typical. A sign may only be displayed during business hours and

design standards in Section 13.6.5 or it may refer the application to the Historic
Preservation Commission for review. The applicant may appeal the decision of the
Historic Preservation Commission to the Woodstock City Council.
Commentary:
The referral of sidewalk sign design or material issues, which are frequently a matter of
interpretation or an attempt to obtain direction and guidance, to the Historic Preservation
Commission does not require the applicant to submit a petition for a Sign Control Ordinance
variation. However, all other sidewalk sign requirements can only be waived if a variation of
the requirements of this Ordinance is granted.
10. If a permit holder fails to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance, the permit
shall become void and the Building and Zoning Director may cause the sign to be
removed.
13.7 Sign Message
A sign message is the information on a sign composed of words, symbols, geometric shapes, pictures
or logos which communicate information to the general public.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 13.13
Including all amendments adopted through 2/5/2019
A. Items of Information

13.8 Permanent Sign Types and Design Factors
Permanent signs are constructed of weatherproof, durable materials and installed to remain in place for
an indefinite period of time. If electrified, installation must comply with the City’s building codes.
Permits are required.
13.8.1 Permanent Wall Signs
A permanent wall sign is a sign which utilizes a flat background with a decorative and/or raised
border, an enclosed “box”, individual three dimensional alphanumeric letter forms, or a combination
thereof, applied directly to the exterior wall of a building.
A. Signable Area
1. Signable area is a triangle or rectangle on the side of a building having an
architecturally emphasized public entrance or fronting on a public street. A signable
area must be uninterrupted by doors, windows, light fixtures, bracing or other
architectural features or decorative elements.
2. A building wall may have several signable areas. A primary signable area must be
selected for purposes of this regulation. The primary signable area is the signable
area where the primary wall sign will be located. A primary wall sign is the largest
wall sign for a business, typically located above a main entrance or centered on the
most prominent façade.
3. In the Historic Downtown Business Preservation District, a signable area may not
extend above the sill of a second story window or the bottom of a faux mansard.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 13.15
Including all amendments adopted through 2/5/2019
4. Outside the Historic Downtown Business Preservation District, signable area may be
located on an uninterrupted area that is located to the side of a bank of second story
windows, up to the top of the second story, or below any cornice, frieze band, fascia
board or similar elements, whichever is lower. A sign may be located on the signable
area of a tower or pediment feature, provided that the top of the signable area may
not be located at a height of more than 20 percent above the average height of the
coping on the adjoining wall.
5. Outside the Historic Downtown Business Preservation District, a signable area may
be on a faux mansard on a one story building, and may be measured to the top of the
mansard or 16 feet, whichever is lower.
B. Sign Size
1. Primary Wall Sign
The maximum area of a primary wall sign shall be 1.5 times the length of the
architectural front of a single tenant building or 1.5 times the length of the unit in a
multi-tenant building; however a sign may never exceed the primary signable area on
which it will be located. (For example: 20’ architectural front = 30 square foot
maximum sign size)
An increase of up to ten percent of the maximum area of a wall sign may be approved
based on demonstrated need, based on factors including, but not limited to, building
design and building setback; but the sign may not exceed the primary signable area
on which it will be located.
The maximum area of wall sign may not exceed 800 square feet.
2. Other Walls with Architecturally Emphasized Public Entrances or which Front Public
Streets
The maximum area of a wall sign on other walls with architecturally emphasized
public entrances or which abut a public street shall be 0.75 times the length of the
wall or the unit; however a sign may never exceed the signable area on which it is
located nor may not exceed the size of the primary sign.
C. Number of Signs
1. One sign may be displayed on any wall containing an architecturally emphasized
public entrance or which fronts a public street.
2. Large Buildings: Outside the Historic Downtown Business Preservation District,
large buildings with architectural fronts that are at least 125 feet in length may
display one primary sign and up to four secondary signs on the same façade. The
size of the secondary signs must be less than 50 percent of the area and less than 50
percent of the vertical dimension of the primary sign. The sum total area of all signs
on the façade may not exceed 1.5 times the length of the building. The maximum
area of wall signage on any building façade shall not exceed 800 square feet.
3. Multiple Tenant Buildings with Shared Entrances and No Storefronts: If a building
contains multiple tenant spaces which share an entrance and do not have individual
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 13.16
Including all amendments adopted through 2/5/2019
storefronts, the tenants must share a directory sign. Individual signs may only be
approved as part of a Comprehensive Signage Plan for a Planned Unit Development
or if the primary business has not utilized all secondary signage as provided for in
Section 13.8.1.C.2.
Commentary:
A multi-tenant building, such as a grocery store, might contain a bank and a coffee shop
inside. If the grocery store building is at least 125 feet in length, it could display one primary
sign with the store’s name, two secondary signs with store products or services, i.e., liquor,
photo processing, etc., leaving two other secondary signs available for the bank and the
coffee shop. In this case, items of information on secondary signs will count toward the items
of information for the primary business.
D. Sign Replacement
Prior to the installation of a new sign, the fascia to which the sign will be installed must be
repaired to the buildings original condition, including, but not limited to, repainting, repair of,
discoloration, and hole repair.
13.8.2 Permanent Ground Signs
A ground sign is a sign that is erected on one or more free-standing bases, frames, masts or
poles and which is not attached to any building. A single permanent ground sign shall be
permitted on each multiple family zoned parcel and for each business or manufacturing
zoning lot or parcel.
A. Area and Height Requirements
The maximum area and height requirements for a permanent ground sign are referenced in
Table 13.1. As specified therein, the maximum area and the height of a permanent ground
sign shall be determined by zoning status, the sign set back and the property frontage. An
increase of up to 10 percent of the maximum area and height of a ground sign may be
approved based on demonstrated need.
In addition, a ground sign is subject to the following regulations:
1. A ground sign shall be setback a minimum of 2 feet from the property line; and
2. There shall be a minimum distance of 40 feet between ground signs.
3. A ground sign shall be located no less than 5 feet from the side lot line and not less
than forty 40 feet from the midpoint of any adjoining property frontage.
4. A ground sign located outside the Historic Downtown Business Preservation District
should include an area for address numeral identification of the site or building.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page 13.17
Including all amendments adopted through 2/5/2019
B. Height Measurement
The height of a ground sign is measured from grade, at the centerline of the street at the point
nearest the center of the sign, to the highest point of the sign face.
C. Area Measurement
The area of a ground sign is the entire area within a single continuous perimeter which
encloses the extreme limits of the lettering, representations, emblems, or other figures,
together with any material or color, which forms an integral part of a display or is used to
differentiate a sign from the background against which it is placed. Structural members
bearing no sign copy shall not be included. Only one side of a ground sign shall be included
in calculating surface area, provided that the two display surfaces are adjoined at an angle not
greater than 60 degrees. All sides of a sign having more than two faces which are visible from
any one street shall be included in the calculation of surface area. The area of the address
numerals shall not be included in the calculation of the overall area of the sign.

in different aspects of Woodstock’s development review process. The membership standards, powers, and
duties of each of these bodies, agencies, and individuals are set forth in the Woodstock City Code and/or
determined by the City Manager, or in the respective ordinances, laws, and policies of the elected or
appointed body or agency, which is the final authority in establishing such membership standards, powers,
and duties. The following sections provide a summary of the role that these elected and appointed bodies,
administrative agencies, and individuals play in the development review process. These sections are not
part of this Ordinance, but are provided as commentary and for informational purposes.
Mayor and City Council
The individuals, including the Mayor, who sit as the City Council comprise the elected governing body of
the City of Woodstock. The Council typically meets on the first and third Tuesdays of each month.
Meetings are held at 7:00 p.m. in the City Hall Council Chambers at 121 West Calhoun Street. The
Council discusses and decides on all matters pertaining to City policy, including development proposals at
both the preliminary and final stages. Final approval of rezoning and special use petitions, preliminary

The Plan Commission is comprised of nine individuals appointed by the Mayor with the consent of the City
Council. The Commission makes recommendations to the City Council regarding rezonings, special use
permits, planned unit developments, and subdivisions. The Commission also reviews and makes
recommendations regarding amendments to Woodstock’s zoning regulations and comprehensive plan. It is
also responsible for holding required public hearings on a variety of land use matters. Although its
function is largely advisory, the Commission has the authority to approve final plats of subdivision. The
Commission typically meets on the fourth Thursday of each month.
Parks and Recreation Commission
The Parks and Recreation Commission provides guidance and recommendations to the City Council
concerning park and recreation facilities and program needs. When new residential developments are
proposed, such as subdivisions and planned units developments, the Commission provides input regarding
whether park land, cash in lieu of land, or a combination thereof should be provided in fulfillment of the
City’s park impact fee obligations.
Zoning Board of Appeals
The Zoning Board of Appeals hears petitions for variations from the requirements of the City’s zoning
regulations. If there is disagreement regarding how these regulations are interpreted by the City
Administration, the Board will determine whether said interpretation is valid. The Board holds required
public hearings pertaining to zoning variations and provides a recommendation to the City Council
regarding a variation petition. The Board meets on the second Monday of each month as necessary.
Special meetings may be called in order to address specific items or to provide additional time in which to
consider a variation or interpretation submittal.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.3
Project Review Commission
The Project Review Commission functions as an architectural and site review appeals body for the City.
Non-residential building activity, as well as multi-family construction activity with three or more dwelling
units, is subject to design approval by the Community and Economic Development Department. Any
appeals of its decisions are heard by the Commission. The Commission is also responsible for holding
public hearings required when a variation from Woodstock’s sign regulations is requested. The
Commission meets on the third Thursday of each month as needed.
Historic Preservation Commission
The Historic Preservation Commission reviews major projects proposed within the City’s “Historic
Downtown Preservation Business District”, as well as other historic districts in the City, for historic
integrity and compatibility. The Commission’s jurisdiction applies to all structures within a historic
district, including single family detached homes. It is also responsible for issuing “Certificates of
Appropriateness” for all building activity, including demolition, new construction, and remodeling. The
Commission meets on the first Monday of each month as needed.
Environmental Commission
The Environmental Commission is responsible for preparing the City’s environmental plan, which includes
identification of open spaces, including municipal parks and identified conservation areas, wetlands, and
water recharge areas, and forests.
Transportation Commission
The Environmental Commission advises the City Council on select aspects of transportation within the
City. It is also responsible for preparing a transportation plan, including the identification of Illinois routes,
alternative and regional arterials, railroads, railroad crossings and overpasses, municipal pedestrian and
bicycle paths, and public transportation routes.
City Manager
The City Manager is responsible for the overall day-to-day functions of the City, and oversees the
operations of all City departments. The City Manager’s Office consists of the City Manager, the Assistant
City Manager, and support staff.
Public Works Director
The Public Works Director is responsible for maintaining all City utilities (water, storm water, sanitary
sewer, water treatment, sewage treatment, etc.) and infrastructure, as well as issuing right-of-way opening
permits and storm water management permits for any building or construction projects which involve
activity in a public street or easement. The Public Works Director also oversees and participates in the
review of all engineering plans submitted for development projects.
Community Development Director/Planning and Zoning Administrator
The Community Development Director oversees the work of the Community and Economic Development
Department, serves as liaison to the Plan Commission, represents the Department at City Council meetings,
and coordinates the review of special uses, rezonings, subdivisions, planned developments, annexations,
and other land use petitions, as well as the application of all applicable land use regulations.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.4
City Planner
The City Planner serves as liaison to the Project Review Commission, Historic Preservation Commission,
and Zoning Board of Appeals, provides guidance and direction regarding the City’s zoning regulations, as
well as their interpretation and enforcement, and is also involved in reviewing proposed site plans and plans
for new subdivisions and planned developments.
City Engineer
The City Engineer is responsible for reviewing and approving all engineering plans submitted to the City as
part of a building or development proposal. The City Engineer coordinates the review of these documents
with the City’s various consulting engineers and Public Works Department personnel, and participates in
the review of site plans and proposed subdivisions and planned unit developments. Letters of credit and
similar site improvement guarantee documents are also handled by the individual in this position.
Building Inspector
The City’s Building Inspectors are responsible for coordinating the plan review and inspection of all
buildings and structures in the City. They also serve as liaisons to the Board of Building Construction and
the Electrical Commission, and administer the City’s electrical licensing program.
Woodstock Community Unit School District 200
With new residential development projects, such as subdivisions and planned unit developments, a
developer is required to obtain input from the School District. This input will indicate the impact of the new
development on the District, the number of students that are expected to be generated, and whether the
development can be accessed by school buses.
Woodstock Fire/Rescue District
The Woodstock Fire/Rescue District provides emergency services to Woodstock and the surrounding
community. When major developments are proposed, such as subdivisions and planned developments,
input from the District regarding emergency vehicle access is requested. Input is also requested for specific
building and construction projects that have a high hazard potential.
McHenry County Department of Planning and Development
Occasionally development activity is proposed which is located within unincorporated McHenry County,
but within the Woodstock’s 1 and ½ mile planning and subdivision jurisdiction. In accordance with State
law and this Ordinance, the subdividing of land within this area must be approved by both McHenry
County and the City of Woodstock. Approval of well and septic systems by the McHenry County Health
Department is also required of these developments. Initial contact for a development in this area is
typically made to the McHenry County Department of Planning and Development.
McHenry County Soil and Water Conservation Service
The McHenry County Soil and Water Conservation District provides information regarding wetlands, soil
types, floodplain status, and similar environmental limitations on a parcel. With certain kinds of petitions,
for example rezonings and special use permit applications, this information is required to be presented to
the City. This is typically provided in the form of a Natural Resources Information Report prepared by
District personnel.

STANDARD LANGUAGE FOR MUNICIPAL EASEMENTS AND
PUBLIC UTILITY EASEMENTS
Municipal easements and/or public utility easements depicted herein are reserved for, dedicated, and
granted to the City of Woodstock, an Illinois municipal corporation, and its successors and assigns, and to
franchisees of any kind operating under franchises granting them easement rights from said City, for the
purposes of constructing, installing, operating, inspecting, maintaining, cleaning, repairing, renewing,
replacing, relocating, altering, enlarging, and removing from time to time mains, pipes, lines, conduit,
wires, fibers, or other on or below ground means of transmission, and any other fixtures, equipment boxes,
valves, fittings, manholes, hydrants, connections and appurtenances which provide on or below ground
utility services, including but not limited to the underground transmission and distribution of radio,
telephone, televisions, communications, data, other sounds and signals, electricity, gas, potable water
supply and distribution, and sanitary sewerage; as well as street lighting and underground or surface storm
sewer drainage and storm water conveyance, as permitted by said City in approved engineering plans for
this subdivision, and without limitation, such other installations, appurtenances and additions thereto as
may be required to furnish utility services as said City and franchisees may together deem necessary;
together with the right to install underground the required service connections to serve the improvements of
each lot (and if applicable, adjacent lots); the right to trim, keep trimmed, remove, or cut down any trees,
bushes, shrubs, saplings, roots, or other vegetation as may be reasonably required that interfere or threaten
to interfere with any of the aforesaid uses; and the right of personnel and equipment to enter upon the lots
at all times for such purposes. These easements shall be permanent and irrevocable and shall run with the
land. The location of utility services installed by said franchisees shall not conflict with or interfere with
public improvements or proper drainage, and shall be subject to City approval. After installation of any
utility services, the grade of the subdivided property shall not be altered in a manner so as to interfere with
the proper operation and maintenance thereof.
No permanent structures, obstructions, or hard surfaces, such as patios, shall be erected or placed on said
easements (except those structures or surfaces installed as a necessary part of providing said utility
services) without the prior written consent of applicable grantees, but the same may be used for gardens,
shrubs, landscaping, and other similar purposes that do not then or later interfere with the aforesaid uses or
rights herein granted. However, if fences are permitted and are to be erected by any owner or owners in
this subdivision within said easements, these must be placed in a location and constructed in a fashion
acceptable to said City that do not interfere with the aforesaid uses or rights herein granted, and prior to
erecting such fences, a fence permit must be obtained from the City of Woodstock. Upon any exercise of
its rights herein, a grantee shall be permitted to remove landscaping, fences, or other permitted
improvements as necessary. A grantee shall not be obligated to bear the cost of or perform the removal of
said landscaping, fences, or other permitted improvements, but may require the lot owner to do so. A
grantee shall restore, if applicable, at its sole expense, the ground and surface vegetation, such as turf, of
the easement area to a condition as good as or better than that which existed prior to exercise. A grantee
shall not be obligated to bear the cost of or perform the re-erection of fences or other permitted

Appendix H:
STATEMENT ON NATURAL LANDSCAPING
Natural landscaping is the design, construction, and maintenance of landscapes that provide
beneficial natural functions which are typically lost through the installation of conventional lawns
or agriculture. Natural landscaping stresses the preservation and reintroduction of plants native to
the Woodstock and northern Illinois area. Native plants are hardy and attractive, and can be used
to stabilize soil, reduce flooding, absorb pollutants, and sustain wildlife.
Within the City of Woodstock the use of natural plant materials for landscaping is encouraged.
The City recognizes the importance of the preserving and restoring natural plant communities and
places significant emphasis on the protection and enhancement of these communities within
Woodstock’s boundaries.
When new development is proposed, the establishment of native plant species is recommended
for placement in drainage swales, at the perimeter of detention basins, within areas designated for
and reserved as open space, within buffer and transitional areas between different uses, and at the
edge of streams, lakes, and wetlands.
The establishment of natural areas must include short and long term management for both routine
and remedial maintenance. The maintenance responsibility should be set forth as part of an
agreement between the property owner or the homeowner’s association and the City so that the
City has a record of who is responsible for such maintenance. Such an agreement should be a
condition of development approval. Among the approaches to managing natural areas are:
o Natural areas may be dedicated to the City or other public agency such as the McHenry
County Conservation District.
o A homeowner’s association may take possession of the natural area and assume
responsibility for its maintenance.
o A conservation easement may be granted to the City or other governmental agency, or to
a not-for-profit group whose primary purpose is to maintain the natural area.
o The owner may continue to own the natural area.
In order to facilitate the maintenance of natural areas, the City may use a Special Service Area
(SSA) which provides funding if the owning entity is unable to properly manage the natural area
over time.
Additional information on natural landscaping and its long term ownership and maintenance can
be found in Chapter 8B.

Appendix I:
CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DESIGN
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.19
subdivisions where the street system is the first thing to be identified, followed by lot lines fanning out to encompass
every square foot of ground into houselots. When municipalities require nothing more than “houselots and streets,”
that is all they receive. But by setting community standards higher and requiring 50 to 70 percent open space as a
precondition for achieving full density, officials can effectively encourage conservation subdivision design. The
protected land in each new subdivision would then become building blocks that add new acreage to community-wide
networks of interconnected open space each time a property is developed.

Appendix J:
CONSERVATION CONCEPTS FOR DEVELOPMENT and GENERAL
PRINCIPLES OF SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
(A) - Conservation Concepts for Development
? Encourage common open space (a common area without property lines and managed by professionals
contracted by a homeowner’s association). Common areas may also protect rivers, lakes, streams,
wetlands, wildlife, and water quality.
? Surface and groundwater quality. Minimize impacts of runoff by using best management practices
(BMPs) such as buffers, vegetated swales, (instead of curb and gutter), constructed wetlands and
wetland bottom detention to improve the quality of runoff, and protect environmentally sensitive areas
(wetlands, rivers, streams).
? Groundwater quantity. Reduce impervious areas in groundwater recharge soils I order to maximize
infiltration.
? Maintain existing vegetation throughout the development process. BMPs such as eliminating mass
grading, protecting existing trees, wooded fence rows and odd areas, vegetated hillsides and wetlands,
contribute to the maintenance of existing vegetative resources.
? Permanently stabilize all cropland going to development. BMPs such as permanent or temporary
vegetative cover, as well as the use of perennial grasses and legumes provide a filter for erosion,
wildlife habitat during development, and stabilize the highly erodible land from the erosive forces of
rainfall.
? Permanently stabilize all stormwater and drainage conveyance easements prior to their use.
? Plan for the establishment of native vegetation in all common areas, drainage areas and conservation
areas. Utilize native vegetation that improves biological diversity for water quality and wildlife
habitat, and prohibits the use of fertilizers, pesticides and mowing.
? Minimize disturbance of sensitive highly erodible soils. This helps to preserve the hydrologic
condition of the soil profile and improve permeability and infiltration that promotes groundwater
recharge.
? Restore existing vegetation. The restoration of native vegetation improves wildlife habitat, stormwater
runoff, and water quality.
? Maintenance. Maintain all land for long term benefits.
? Use buffers. Buffers provide esthetic amenities, and also water quality and natural resource protection.
? Eliminate stormwater detention drainage into agriculture drain tiles.
? Erosion and sediment control plan. Highly erodible soils require a well-planned and implemented
erosion control and sedimentation control plan utilizing the above referenced BMPs.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.21
(B) General Principles of Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
? Plan the development to fit the particular topography, soils, drainage patterns, and natural vegetation of
the site.
? Preserve and protect areas of natural vegetation on the site.
? Take special precautions to prevent damage which could result from development activity adjacent to
watercourses, lakes, and wetlands.
? Minimize the extent and duration of the area exposed at one time.
? Apply temporary erosion control practices as soon as possible to stabilize exposed soils and prevent
on-site damage.
? Install sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and perimeter control practices prior to site
clearing and grading to protect disturbed areas from off-site and on-site runoff, and to prevent sediment
damage to areas located down slope of the development site.
? Keep runoff velocities low and provide for retention of runoff on the site.
? Provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
? Implement final grading and install permanent vegetation on disturbed areas as soon as possible.
? Implement through inspection, maintenance and follow-up program.

Appendix JA:
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR RESTORATION, PLANTING,
MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING OF NATURAL OPEN SPACE AND
NATURALIZED STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
The requirements listed below apply to PUDs, subdivisions, and conservation design developments
involving the creation of natural and naturalized open space areas. Their purpose is to ensure that the
overall design intent for these areas, including existing open spaces, prairies, wet-detention basins, drainage
swales, and buffers, is achieved and maintained, particularly during the initial plant establishment phase.
Such areas are intended to provide an aesthetic, healthy, diverse community of native vegetation to meet
the objectives of soil stabilization, stormwater treatment, and wildlife habitat. This is accomplished by
complying with the following requirements:
1. The development and implementation of a landscape/planting/monitoring and maintenance
plan.
2. Routine monitoring of planting success.
3. Follow-up repair, re-seeding, and/or replanting to meet performance criteria.
4. Preparation of three annual reports summarizing monitoring data, documenting maintenance
and remedial activities in comparison to stated performance criteria.
5. Preparation of a long term monitoring and management to maintain the areas in perpetuity.
6. Evaluation of performance standards at the end of the three-year monitoring and management
period, and required long term monitoring and management provisions.
Monitoring is required annually for a minimum of three full growing seasons following planting. Under
circumstances where the minimum performance standards cannot be achieved, alternative performance
standards must be presented to the City for approval.
The establishment of native prairie and wetland vegetation within any PUD, subdivision, or conservation
development shall be carefully planned and executed to ensure long term success. Native planting efforts
should be considered on an equal footing with other major infrastructure improvements of a development,
such as roads, public utilities, and building standards. Without performance standards, open space
restoration and native plant establishment is likely to fail in many circumstances, leaving future home
owner associations or the City with major management problems that they may not have the expertise or
resources to address. Therefore, it is important to provide reasonable performance standards to regulate the
planning, establishment, and monitoring success of native plantings within developments.
1. Landscape/Planting Plan
A site specific landscape/planting plan shall be submitted to the City with required site or final engineering
plans. The plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional in the field of natural resources and who is
acceptable to the City. At a minimum the plan shall include:
? A map drawn to scale and depicting all proposed planting areas. Proposed management units should
rely heavily on soil types, topography and hydrology. Management unit mapping will also show the
overall layout of the development to demonstrate that naturalized areas are adequately set-back from
homes and other infrastructure so that the potential for fire hazard during controlled or accidental burns
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.23
is reduced. If applicable, fire breaks, including those in the form of of mowed paths, should also be
identified.
? A list all plants, seeds, and/or plugs to be used within each management unit. All plantings will consist
of species native to McHenry County, of a local genotype, and appropriate for the proposed habitat.
The number of plants and plugs to be used and the amount/weight of seed per species shall also be
included, along with seeding rates per acre for each species.
? A three-year management schedule which includes proposed timing and description of the following:
site preparation, application of herbicides, seeding activity, mowing, controlled burns, and similar
activities. Areas restored to native communities should be protected by silt fencing or construction
fencing to prevent unnecessary disruption or destruction due to nearby construction activity.
2. Plant Monitoring
The following tasks shall be performed within each management unit identified in the landscape/planting
plan during the first 3 years:
? Plant inventory of all naturally landscaped areas. This inventory shall determine overall vegetative
cover, the total number of species, and the prevalence of undesirable/invasive species, consistent with
specified performance criteria. This inventory is used to determine where follow-up seeding or
planting is needed and to identify, locate, and remove undesirable “weedy” species on a timely basis.
Permanent transect vegetation sampling techniques should be used within each management unit to
adequately document and monitor plant community establishment over the initial 3 year period. The
presence of any plant species observed outside of a transect and not documented by sampling along
such transect shall also be noted. Sampling techniques and summaries shall be compiled consistent
with methods described in Plants of the Chicago Region by Floyd Swink and Gerould Wilhelm.
? Establishment of permanent photographic monitoring locations: Photographs will be taken to
document the establishment of vegetative cover, erosion problems, and other relevant maintenance
concerns within each management unit identified in the landscape/planting plan. Photographs must be
of satisfactory quality and resolution to accomplish the intent of the performance standards and shall
be taken from the same locations during each monitoring event. A detailed description of the
camera/photo location based on distance from a permanent structure, the orientation of the photo, and
the vegetation zone being photographed shall be provided. Additional photos should be taken of
problem areas and remedial activities.
3. Performance Criteria
In order to ensure adequate diversity of plants, to respond to varying environmental and hydrologic
conditions, to ensure the establishment of native landscapes that are functional, aesthetic, and costeffective,
and to provide reasonable variety to meet aesthetic expectations, a minimum of 10 species of
native plants are required within any naturalized stormwater facility, such as wetland detention basins
or swales. A minimum of 40 native species will be established in any upland prairie re-creations.
The success of natural landscaping can be affected by the appropriateness of the plant species selected,
the effectiveness of the grading and installation of stormwater management basins and swales, the
quality of the plant material used, and attention to early maintenance. With upland prairie re-creations,
it is appropriate to leave soils undisturbed since mass grading will result in compacted soils and may
lead to serious weed problems. Land currently under agricultural row crop production should remain
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.24
undisturbed if possible until prairie seeding can be accomplished. This will contribute to the success of
the native landscape by preventing the establishment of weeds and minimizing the corruption of the
seed bank. The success of the project will be formally evaluated by the following vegetation
performance standards monitored over time.
? By the end of the first full growing season, upland planted areas should have 90 percent vegetation
cover and no upland area greater than 1.0 meter square shall be devoid of vegetation. A cover
crop of annual rye or oats may be used to help achieve this goal. If an area is designed as an
aquatic or emergent system, it is anticipated that portions of the submerged area will be
periodically exposed and without vegetation cover due to fluctuating water levels. If, by the end
of the first full growing season, the basin emergent zones and/or side slopes fail to support the
establishment of sufficient vegetation, then corrective measures regarding the fundamental design
of the area and/or planting plan shall be required. At least 75 percent of the plugs, root stock, and
tubers, and 90 percent of the seeded species should be present and alive.
? During the second growing season at least 60 percent of the permanent species planted in seed
form should be evident. Ninety percent or more of species planted as plugs, root stock, and tubers,
shall also have persisted into the second season. If this fails to occur, a determination must be
made as to why and remedial action shall be necessary. Remediation may include overseeding
and/or plugging of appropriate species. Finally, undesirable, invasive plant species shall not be
prevalent in any of the management units. Specifically, none of the following shall be among the
five most dominant plant species in the overall vegetative cover.
- Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea)
- Common reed (Phragmites australis)
- Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)
- Non-native thistle (Cirsium spp., Carduus spp.)
- Sweet clover (Melilotus spp.)
- Crown vetch (Coronilla varia)
- Wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa)
- Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata)
- Teasel (Dipsacus spp.)
- Ragweed (Ambrosia spp.)
- Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis)
- Buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.)
- Sandbar willow (Salix interior)
- Honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.)
- Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora)
- Box elder (Acer negundo)
? At the end of the third full growing season, at least 75 percent of the seeded permanent species and
90 percent or more of species planted as plugs, root stock, and tubers are expected to be
established. Alternatively, native perennial species that volunteer on the site, excluding
undesirable invasive species, may also be counted in determining the preceding criteria.
Qualitative vegetative sampling within each management area shall achieve the following to be
determined a success and a mean Coefficient of Conservatism shall meet or exceed 3 and the
Floristic Quality Index shall meet or exceed 20 (Swink and Wilhelm).
The five most dominant species of the overall vegetative cover within each management unit shall
not include any of the undesirable species listed above under the 2nd season performance
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.25
standards. If the identified level of species development fails to occur, a determination must be
made as to why, and a remedial action plan must be prepared and submitted to the City for
approval. The approved remedial plan must be implemented and continued monitoring will be
required beyond the third growing season until these performance criteria are met. Where the
minimum performance standards cannot be achieved, a written explanation and alternative
performance standards must be approved by the City.
4. Annual Reporting
An annual monitoring report shall be submitted to the City and shall include the following:
? A summary of vegetation data collected within each management unit, including an
assessment of compliance with performance criteria.
? A description of vegetation maintenance activities, including overseeding, replanting, and
control of undesirable “weedy” species, and an assessment of their effectiveness in
meeting performance criteria.
? Photographs and accompanying descriptions taken at permanent monitoring stations.
? A summary of planned maintenance activities for the coming year.
5. Long Term Monitoring and Management Plan
? Continued maintenance shall be provided to maintain a diverse native plant community, consistent
with performance criteria, to minimize the proliferation of weeds and undesired woody vegetation,
and to prevent erosion. Long term maintenance should consist of control burn management every
one to three years, as required by site conditions. To maintain the established native plant
communities, minimal spot control and application of herbicides may be necessary.
? Long term maintenance shall include the removal of trash or debris and the removal of
obstructions from basin outlet structures. Periodic removal of accumulated sediment from swales,
forebays, and settling basins shall be done to maintain the function and aesthetics of stormwater
facilities. At a minimum, sediment shall be removed from forebays and sediment basins when 1
or more feet of sediment has accumulated.
6. Sign Off and Acceptance
Final approval and release of improvement guarantees shall not occur until a final inspection by the City
verifies that performance criteria have been met. When the performance standards have been met, the City
shall allow the areas to be placed under the control of an approved conservation organization or
homeowners association to implement the long term management of the natural areas. In the event that
conditions of performance criteria cannot be met, an alternative plan shall be prepared or a fee-in-lieu of
payment, to be determined by the City, may be used to meet performance criteria standards.

APPLICATION AND PROCEDURES FOR ZONING VARIATIONS
The following information summarizes the zoning variation process and includes an application
form and sample format for legal notices. The Zoning Variation process is coordinated by the
Community Development Department, however it is the responsibility of the applicant to publish,
mail and post all required notices. The Woodstock Zoning Board of Appeals conducts a public
hearing on all zoning variation petitions and makes recommendations to the City Council. The
City Council makes the final decision to approve or deny any proposed variation.
A. FILING PROCEDURE
1. File the petition. The completed application/petition for variation should be filed with
Community Development Department, accompanied by the required filing fee. The petition
should include one copy of a plat of survey and 10 copies of any exhibits to be distributed to
the Zoning Board of Appeals. Any items over 8 ½ inches x 11 inches should be folded.
2. Publish a legal notice in a local newspaper, either the Woodstock Independent or the
Northwest Herald, after review by the Community Development. The notice must be
published at least one time no less than 15 days and no more than 30 days prior to the public
hearing. The legal notice should utilize the format of the attached example. PROOF OF
PUBLICATION IS REQUIRED. The newspaper will provide a certificate of publication
which should then be filed with the Community Development Department.
3. Notify all adjoining property owners. Adjoining properties are all parcels that touch the
parcel which is the subject of the petition, or would touch the subject parcel if there were no
streets or alleys. The names and addresses of the most receipt taxpayers of record may be
obtained at the McHenry County Assessor’s Office. A copy of the same legal notice which
was submitted to the newspaper should be used. Some applicants also find it helpful to
include an informal letter explaining their request, along with the required legal notice.
Adjoining property owners must be notified no less than 15 days and no more than 30 days
prior to the public hearing.
PROOF OF NOTIFICATION IS REQUIRED. Notification can be made via
certified mail, in which case the green signature cards should be filed with the
Community Development Department, or by hand delivery. If hand delivered
the property owner, not a tenant, must sign the “Certificate of Direct
Notification” which is included in the application packet.
4. Post a public hearing sign in a prominent location on the property. The Community
Development Department will provide the sign. The sign must be posted on the property, no
less than 15 days and no more than 30 days prior to the hearing.
B. ZONING BOARD HEARINGS AND CITY COUNCIL ACTION
Upon submittal of a complete application, the Community Development Department will assign a
hearing date. The Zoning Board of Appeals meets the second Monday of each month at 7:00
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.32
p.m. in the Woodstock City Council Chambers. Agendas are finalized two weeks prior to the
meeting and meeting packets are mailed out to Zoning Board members approximately one week
before the meetings. Following the Zoning Board hearing, a recommendation is forwarded to the
City Council for its consideration.
The petitioners should be present to explain their request, including the reasons there is a
hardship. Zoning Board members and the general public may ask questions. The general public
may also offer testimony. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning Board must
complete a findings of fact statement and make a recommendation to the City Council to approve
or deny the petition.
The City Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month. A petition is typically
acted on by the Council on the first Tuesday of the month following the Zoning Board hearing.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
Petitioners for variations shall be based upon particular hardships or difficulties. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may determine and recommend to the City Council a variation of the zoning
regulations when it finds:
1. The particular surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property
involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations was carried out;
2. The conditions upon which the petition for a variation are based are unique to the property for
which the variation is sought and are not applicable, generally to the other property with the
same zoning classification; and
3. The proposed of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the monetary
gain realized from the property or to alleviate financially difficulty experienced by the
petitioner in the attempt to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance; and
4. The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the application of this Ordinance and has not
been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; and
5. The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other
property or improvements in the neighborhoods in which the property is located; and
6. That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets or increase the danger
of fire, or endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values with
the adjacent neighborhood; and
7. That the granting of the variation requested will not confer on the applicant any special
privilege that is denied by the Ordinance to other lands, structures or buildings of the same
district.
Unified Development Ordinance 2010 Edition, City of Woodstock, Illinois – Page A.33
SAMPLE PETITION FOR VARIATION
To the Zoning board of Appeals:
1. Common Address of the Property:______________________________________
2. Statement of Ownership (list legal name, address of the property owners and state how long
they have owned the property.)
3. Applicant (list name of the applicant if different from the owner and state the interest of the
applicant in the property. Also state when his or her interest was acquired.)
4. State the legal description of the property or attach a legible copy.
5. State the specific variation (s) requested including zoning ordinance section numbers.
Include the ordinance requirement and the proposed request.
6. State in detail the reasons for the requested variation by answering the following questions.
If additional space is needed, attach extra pages to the application.
What features of the property prevent it from being used for the uses permitted by the zoning
classification? Check all that apply and explain why they apply. Give dimensions where
appropriate.
? Too narrow ? Elevation
? Too small ? Slope
? To shallow ? Shape
? Soil conditions ? Subsurface conditions
How do the above conditions prevent reasonable use of the property under the term of the
Woodstock Unified Development Ordinance?
Was the hardship created by anyone who had an interest (ownership) in the property after the
Zoning Ordinance was enacted ; is the hardship self-imposed?
Are the conditions for which you request a variance unique to your property?
Are the conditions of the property the result of other man-made conditions (such as the relocation
of a road)?
Is the requested variation the minimum variation that will make possible the reasonable use of the
land, buildings, or structure.
