CORTE MADERA 
MUNICIPAL CODE 
1970

A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Corte Madera, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 12, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation

> 
PREFACE 
    The Corte Madera, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1970, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 12, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the town attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 12, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 980, adopted December 18, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the town as accessible as possible to town officials, town employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, Town Manager, can be added between 2.04, Town Council, and Chapter 2.08, Town Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 12, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

3.08.030 - Tax imposed. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel/motel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator.

If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel/motel.

This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this town. This certificate does not constitute a permit."

At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he/she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he/she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the town until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

(d)  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he/she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he/she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his/her last known place of address. The operator may within fifteen days after the earlier of the personal service or mailing of such notice may appeal the decision of the tax administrator pursuant to Section 3.08.100.

At least fifteen day[s] prior [to] the hearing, the IHO shall give notice in writing to the operator and the tax administrator of the time and place for the hearing. A rebuttable presumption shall exist at the hearing that the amount of any tax assessed by the tax administrator is correct and the burden of proof shall be upon the operator. At the hearing before the IHO, the appellant and the representative of the tax administrator may submit such evidence and argument as they believe to be relevant to their respective positions. The IHO may require the presentation of additional evidence or argument, or both, from either the appellant or the representative of the tax administrator, or from both, and may continue the hearing from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence or argument, or both, but in no event may the hearing continue beyond thirty days from the date the hearing began. Within thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing, the IHO shall determine the proper amount of the tax, including any penalties and interest. The decision and findings of the IHO shall be conclusive and final.

(b)  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient.

(c)  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the town by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

Chapter 3.28 - CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FUND 
Sections: 

3.28.010 - Purpose. 
    In order to replace major pieces of existing capital equipment in a timely manner without placing an undue financial burden on the town in the fiscal year of acceptance of a piece of equipment, and to provide a self-leave insurance mechanism to fund property damage, there is established for the town of Corte Madera a capital equipment replacement and property damage fund, hereinafter referred to as equipment fund. 
(Ord. 670 § 1, 1978) 
3.28.020 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter the following definitions are given: 
(1)  "Capital equipment" means tangible property of a more or less permanent nature with an estimated replacement cost in excess of twenty thousand dollars. "Capital equipment" includes, but is not limited to, motorized vehicles, nonvehicular motorized equipment and machinery, and other equipment and machinery. 
(2)  "Property damage" means the damage, destruction, theft or loss of any type and kind of municipal property from any cause. "Property damage" includes, but is not limited to, physical damage to or complete loss of motor vehicles by collision, fire, flood or other occurrence; physical damage to or complete loss of buildings and contents by earthquake, fire, flood or other occurrence; deliberate theft of any municipal property; and accidental loss of any municipal property. 
(Ord. 670 § 2, 1978) 
3.28.030 - Initial funding. 
    To provide initial funding to the equipment fund, a sufficient amount of money shall be transferred by resolution from the fund balance of each operating fund providing for the maintenance and operation of such equipment to the equipment fund to cover budgetary depreciation on existing capital equipment through June 30, 1979. 
(Ord. 670 § 3, 1978) 
3.28.040 - General budgeting and accounting procedures. 
    Commencing in fiscal year 1979-80, and every fiscal year thereafter, the preliminary budget shall allocate moneys for budgetary depreciation on such equipment in the appropriate town operating funds. On June 30, 1980, and every June 30th thereafter, budgeted moneys for capital equipment replacement shall be recorded as expenditures against appropriate budgetary depreciation accounts in the various operating funds and transferred to reserve accounts in the equipment fund. In the fiscal year of ordering equipment, the equipment shall be budgeted in the equipment fund. If there are not sufficient moneys in the reserve account to cover the expenditure for replacement on June 30th of the fiscal year of acceptance of the equipment, sufficient moneys shall be recorded as an expenditure against the appropriate budgetary depreciation account in the applicable operating fund and transferred to the reserve account in the equipment fund for the piece of equipment. In the event there are surplus moneys in the reserve account after charging the expenditure for replacement, these moneys shall remain in the reserve account. If it is determined not to replace equipment that has been budgetarily depreciated due to obsolescence, property damage or any other reason during the budgetary depreciation term, moneys in the reserve account may be transferred to: other depreciation reserve accounts having their funding source in the same budget activity; or back to the appropriate operating fund. During the annual budget preparation, if it is determined the estimated replacement cost for a piece of equipment that has not been budgetarily depreciated exceeds twenty thousand dollars budgetary depreciation shall commence on that piece of equipment in the following fiscal year. 
(Ord. 670 § 4, 1978) 
3.28.050 - Calculating budgetary depreciation. 
    The amount of money to be budgeted for budgetary depreciation shall be determined in the following manner: 
    During budget preparations, the fiscal year of replacement for each piece of equipment and the estimated replacement cost for same shall be reevaluated and changed as necessary. The amount budgeted for budgetary depreciation shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated replacement cost the amount that will be accumulated in the equipment fund's reserve account for the piece of equipment on July 1st of the budget year. Based on the fiscal year of acceptance of a piece of equipment, this figure shall be divided by the remaining years of budgetary depreciation which shall include the fiscal year of acceptance. The resulting amount is the budget figure. 
(Ord. 670 § 5, 1978) 
3.28.060 - Use of moneys. 
    There shall be no permanent expenditures of equipment fund moneys for purposes other than those specified in this chapter. Moneys of the equipment fund may be loaned by resolution to other funds of the town providing that the moneys shall be returned to the equipment fund in time to meet the equipment replacement schedule. Interest earnings on moneys of the equipment fund shall be recorded as revenue to the property damage reserve account.

The town council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the town council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder under such circumstances, the amount of the lowest bidder's security shall be applied by the town to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and any excess amount of the security not so applied, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. In the event the lowest responsible bidder fails to execute the contract, and as a result thereof, the town council rejects all bids presented and readvertises, the amount of the lowest bidder's security may be used to offset the cost of receiving new bids and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder.

Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices.

(d)  Rejection of Bids. In its discretion, the town council may reject any and all bids presented and readvertise for bids pursuant to the procedure hereinabove prescribed. 
(e)  Award of Contracts. Except as otherwise provided herein, contracts shall be awarded by the town council to the lowest responsible bidder. 
(f)  Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay or readvertising for bids, the town council may in its discretion accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by and after negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening.

Chapter 3.44 - VILLAGE SQUARE PARKING FUND 
Sections: 

3.44.010 - Purpose. 
    The ordinance codified in this chapter is enacted for the purpose of establishing a Village Square parking fund for the development of parking spaces in the Village Square area to satisfy the parking requirements of new or expanded developments in the Village Square which cannot provide on-site parking. This fee would only be required for proposed developments which cannot provide required off-street parking and for which the planning commission finds to be in the public interest to allow the in-lieu fee as an option for the required parking. 
(Ord. 770 § 1, 1992) 
3.44.020 - Findings. 
(a)  Village Square is a unique area of the town because of the Square's historical significance and because it provides opportunities to create a civic and cultural activities center for Corte Madera. 
(b)  Some properties in the Village Square area that will be developed in the future do not lend themselves well to the provision of off-street parking without violating the design objectives established for the Square; for example, providing off-street parking on certain properties would contravene the adopted design guideline which reads: "Continuous building facades along block fronts around the park (i.e., park-facing facades should be unbroken by driveway approaches)." 
(c)  Because of the uniqueness of the Village Square area and the need to encourage design around the Square which will enhance pedestrian interest, the town council desires to establish an alternative for on-street parking by allowing those properties which cannot provide required on-site parking, as determined by the planning commission, to pay an in-lieu fee for the development of parking elsewhere within the immediate vicinity. 
(d)  The relationship between the in-lieu fee and the resulting parking facilities is explained by the fact that the in-lieu fee is a way of satisfying a parking requirement which otherwise could not be satisfied, thereby enabling development to occur which otherwise could not. 
(Ord. 770 § 2, 1992) 
3.44.030 - Village Square in-lieu parking fee. 
    An in-lieu parking fee is established that may be applied to projects immediately surrounding Menke Park in Village Square that need to provide on-site parking to meet the requirements of the town's zoning ordinance, but cannot provide such parking on-site. (See Figure 3.44.030 for the area where the in-lieu parking fee may be applied.) Participation in the parking fee is voluntary on the part of the property owner as an alternative to the on-site parking required by the town's zoning ordinance. The amount of said fees shall be established by resolution of the town council and amended from time to time for the purpose of reflecting changes in construction costs and land values. The costs will be directly related to the fair market value of land required for a parking space and the estimated costs of developing a parking space. 
(Ord. 770 § 3, 1992) 
3.44.040 - Village Square parking fund established-Limited use of said fund. 
    There is created a "Village Square parking fund," into which all in-lieu parking fees collected pursuant hereto shall be deposited. The money in said fund and interest derived from the fund shall be segregated from other town funds and shall be expended solely for the land or construction costs associated with developing parking spaces in the Village Square area. 
(Ord. 770 § 4, 1992) 
3.44.050 - Applicability specifically to Village Square. 
    This in-lieu parking fee program applies only to those properties immediately surrounding Menke Park and can only be approved for a specific development if found by the planning commission that this alternative to on-site parking is necessary to achieve the objectives described by the Village Square design guidelines, in the best interests of the Village Square area, and promotes the objectives of the town's general plan. This alternative to on-site parking is appropriate for Village Square, and this chapter is intended to apply to Village Square only.

Chapter 3.48 - AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND 
Sections: 

3.48.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish a feasible means by which developers of nonresidential development projects can assist in increasing the supply of affordable housing in close proximity to where new employees to their projects work. The impact fees contained in this chapter have been calculated to have a rational relationship between the amount of housing needed as a result of developing various businesses and the amount of subsidy needed to make the development of affordable housing feasible. This impact fee shall be deposited into an affordable housing fund and used by the town to create long-term protected affordable housing or cause others to create that housing. 
(Ord. 859 § 1 (part), 2001) 
3.48.020 - Findings. 
(a)  Commercial and industrial developments in Corte Madera, such as office, retail, research, development, industrial, and warehouse uses, hereinafter all referred to as "nonresidential developments" have been and continue to be a major factor in attracting new employees to the area. Some of these employees will seek to reside in the town. These new employees and their families create a need for additional housing in the town. 
(b)  The availability of housing in Corte Madera is limited, with an over all vacancy rate among all housing units of only 3.75 percent. The availability of affordable housing is even more scarce, with an October 2000 survey of major apartment buildings throughout town showing a vacancy rate of only 1.6 percent-i.e. only five apartments were vacant of the three hundred eight total number of apartments surveyed. Multiple household properties tend to offer the most affordable rental rates. 
(c)  Corte Madera currently has significantly more jobs than housing units in the town, with five thousand eight hundred ten jobs and three thousand six hundred seventy housing units. There are also more jobs in Corte Madera than the four thousand six hundred employed residents. New nonresidential development that creates additional jobs will create the need for additional housing to accommodate the new workers. 
(d)  The Association of Bay Area Governments has determined that twenty-six percent of the projected growth in jobs in Corte Madera over the next five years will have incomes less than eighty percent of the area's median income. Many of these new workers will require affordable housing-that is, housing costs that do not total more than thirty percent of the household income. Lack of affordable housing for new employees in Corte Madera will force many new employees to commute considerable distances, adding to the air pollution and traffic problems in the general area. 
(e)  Sponsors of nonresidential developments that contribute to the shortage of affordable housing should be required to contribute to programs that increase the town's affordable housing stock. Corte Madera has caused to be prepared a study that examines the connection between nonresidential development and housing needs. The report concluded that a clear nexus can be established between the number of jobs generated by various work place types and the number of future employees filling those jobs needing below market rate housing. 
(f)  A study of "Non-Residential Development and Housing Needs," prepared for the town in November 2000 and reviewed by this town council when considering this chapter, concluded that a clear nexus can be established between the development of commercial, industrial, and other job generating uses and the need for housing the workers at these new developments. 
(g)  That study examined the number of employees that can be expected to occupy a prototype building, using ten different business types and associated densities of employees, and developed a projected number of housing units needed to accommodate such businesses. The model was based on a one hundred thousand square foot building, and from that an appropriate cost per square foot of new nonresidential development was calculated. The nonresidential development impact fees are as follows: 
Workplace Type Impact Fee Per Square Foot Office $ 4.79 R + D lab 3.20 Light industrial 2.79 Warehouse .40 Retail 8.38 Commercial services 1.20 Restaurant 4.39 Health club/recreation 2.00 Training facility/school 2.39 Hotel 1.20  
(h)  State law requires that the town determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the type of development projects on which a fee is imposed and the fee's use. Also, the town shall determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the public facility (in this case, affordable housing) attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed. These relationships have been established by the above referenced study and staff and consultant reports received by the town as part of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, all of which are incorporated by this reference. 
(Ord. 859 § 1 (part), 2001) 
3.48.030 - Establishment of affordable housing fund. 
    An affordable housing fund is established. The money in said fund and interest derived from the fund shall be segregated from other town funds and shall be expended solely for the land or building costs associated with developing housing affordable to low and very-low-income households, as defined by the Main County housing authority. 
(Ord. 859 § 1 (part), 2001) 
3.48.040 - Nonresidential development impact fee. 
    No building permit shall be issued for: any change in use where the resultant use is nonresidential; any new nonresidential development project; or any expansion of an existing nonresidential development in Corte Madera unless and until a housing impact fee is paid to the town and thence deposited into the affordable housing fund. The amount of the fee shall be computed as follows: Gross square feet of the new or expanded nonresidential space multiplied by the applicable fee by type of use as set forth in Section 3.48.020(g). Any change in use of existing developments shall require a housing impact fee based on the fee for the new, nonresidential use, with credit given for the former use if it was a less intense use (that is, paid no or a lower impact fee) and was in business within six months prior to submittal of building permit application for the new use; otherwise, no credit shall be given for the fee paid in connection with the prior use. Notwithstanding the above, (1) any person who proposes to change one nonresidential use to another nonresidential use requiring a higher housing impact fee shall only be responsible for paying the additional increment in fees, as shown by the schedule of fees in Section 3.48.020(g), and (2) any person who proposes to change any use for which the applicable housing impact fee is equal to or lower than the housing impact fee applicable to the proposed nonresidential use, shall not be required to pay any housing impact fee. 
(1)  The affordable housing fund shall be administered by the director of environmental services, who shall have the authority to govern the fund consistent with this chapter, and to prescribe procedures for said purpose, subject to town council approval. 
(2)  Monies in the affordable housing fund shall be used to finance the development of affordable housing for low income and very-low-income households, with preference given to employees at the nonresidential developments contributing to the fund. These monies shall be used to construct, rehabilitate, subsidize, or assist other governmental entities, private organizations or individuals in the construction of housing affordable to households of low and very low incomes. The uses shall include, but are not limited to, assistance to nonprofit providers of housing, equity participation loans, acquisition of land for affordable housing, and public/private partnership arrangements, where the resulting affordable housing is protected for a period of at least fifty-five years to remain affordable to low and very-low-income households. 
(3)  The director of environmental services shall report annually to the planning commission and to the town council on the status of activities undertaken with the affordable housing fund. The report shall include a statement of income, expenses, disbursements, and all uses of the fund. The report shall recommend any changes to this chapter necessary to carry out its purposes, including any adjustments necessary to the fee. The town council shall review and make necessary adjustments in the fee schedule listed in Section 3.48.020(g) every five years or more frequently if the town council deems it appropriate. 
(4)  For purposes of this Section 3.48.040, "development" shall have the same meaning as specified in Section 18.04.190.

To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the Town to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose. 
B.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. 
C.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure that can be administered and collected by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes. 
D.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this ordinance.

    In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume of business or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, after having first obtained the written approval of the town attorney, and recommend to the town council for their consideration, amount of license tax to be charged. The town council shall fix as the license tax an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the town council shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this section. Should the town council determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, they may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the town or at the end of each three month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor, provided that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this chapter.

Tobacco retail license ordinances restrict youth access to tobacco and tobacco products by providing a mechanism for revoking a retailer's ability to sell tobacco. Additionally, communities are adopting local prohibitions against the sale of flavored tobacco products as a way to further reduce smoking and promote public health.

The council may impose a fee of two thousand dollars to cover all expenses of the town incurred in investigating the financial status and ability of the proposed transferee. It is the intention of the town council to prevent the peddling of any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter after the award thereof. No consent to the transfer of such franchise shall be granted by the council unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the town council that the grantee has in good faith proceeded to install the CATV system, and that only unusual or extraordinary circumstances prevent the grantee from operating the system, or that other satisfactory reason exists for such transfer. Where a grantee of a franchise seeks the consent of the council to a transfer of the franchise prior to the installation of a substantial portion of the system, the council may, at its discretion, refuse to consent to such transfer, and it may award a new franchise in the same manner as the original franchise was issued. The consents provided for herein shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(g)  The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the town for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of or relating to any provision or requirement of this chapter, or of any franchise issued hereunder or because of its enforcement.

(i)  As between the grantee and the town, any and all construction, operation and maintenance by any CATV grantee in the town shall be deemed and construed to be under and pursuant to the franchise and not under or pursuant to any other right, privilege, power, immunity or authority of the town. 
(Ord. 433 § 6, 1976) 
5.08.070 - Rights reserved to the town. 
(a)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way, to any extent, the right of the town to acquire the property of the grantee, either by purchase or through the exercise of the right of eminent domain, at a fair and just value, which shall not include any amount for the franchise itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity, the town's right of eminent domain. 
(b)  Neither the granting of any franchise under this chapter, nor any provision contained herein, shall be construed to prevent the town from granting any identical or similar franchise to any other person, firm or corporation, within all or any portion of the town. 
(c)  Neither the granting of any franchise or any provision hereof shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the town heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. 
(d)  The council may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter, and may determine any question of fact which may arise during the existence of any franchise granted hereunder. The town manager is authorized and empowered to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any grantee under this chapter, either on behalf of the town, the grantee or any subscriber. Either the grantee or any member of the public who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the town manager may appeal the matter to the council for hearing and determination. The council may accept, reject of modify the decision of the town manager, and may adjust, settle or compromise any controversy arising from the operation of any grantee or from any provision of this chapter. 
(e)  There is reserved to the town the power to amend any part of this chapter so as to require additional or greater standards of construction, operation or maintenance, to conform to then-current standards. The grantee shall thereupon comply with such amendment as the council shall direct. 
(f)  In connection with the issuance of any franchise hereunder, the town council may impose such reasonable restrictions, conditions and limitations as to the area or areas of the town to be served by the franchise holder, operating conditions and cooperative working arrangements relative to local television broadcasting stations servicing the town with the best possible television reception.

(g)  Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth herein shall be grounds for termination of such franchise. However, the council, in its discretion, may extend the time for the commencement and completion of construction and installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond his control. 
(h)  For systems already constructed, the grantee must have accomplished significant construction and have equitably extended energized trunk-cable to substantially serve all of the franchise area.

(d)  To insure that cable television service is available under these provisions, the builder or developer will provide the town with plans for inclusion of cable television service with his plans for utilities, including telephone, electrical and gas service prior to obtaining a town building permit. The builder or developer will also include proof that a contractual agreement exists between the builder or developer and the grantee, which is consistent with the provisions of this section.

(2)  A statement and description of the CATV system proposed to be constructed, installed, maintained or operated by the applicant, the proposed location of such system and its various components, the manner in which the applicant proposed to construct, install, maintain and operate the same, and, particularly, the extent and manner in which existing or future poles or other facilities of other public utilities will be used for such system, and/or whether such lines and amplifiers shall be placed underground; 
(3)  A description in detail of the public streets, public places and proposed public streets within which the applicant proposes or seeks authority to construct, install or maintain any CATV equipment or facilities, a detailed description of the equipment or facilities proposed to be constructed, installed or maintained therein, and the proposed specific locations thereof;

(b)  A franchise may be renewed under the following procedure: 
(1)  Twelve months before expiration of the franchise, a citizens' evaluation and advisory committee, whose membership shall consist of members from the community and from the town administrative staff, shall be appointed by the town council to review the performance of the grantee and the content of the town municipal code relating to CATV.

To achieve this objective, the town may work with the grantee to define the communication needs and analyze the benefits which may be achieved in relationship to subscriber rates commensurate with the cost of providing these services. The town council should assume responsibility relating to the communication uses of cable television in those areas where it may exert regulatory influence. In those areas not specifically regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, it shall be the intent of the town to assume these powers. Further, the town should work with the grantee on an ongoing basis to insure that federal regulations are applied within the town to the best advantage of its citizens.

(e)  After notice and hearing, the town council may reduce any or all of the subscriber rates of affected subscribers if the grantee fails to provide adequate service as required by the franchise, ordinance, municipal code or Federal Communications Commission regulations. The grantee is not responsible for failure to provide adequate service which is caused by acts of God, strikes, governmental or military action or similar conditions beyond its control. 
(f)  In the event that its service to any subscriber is interrupted for twenty-four consecutive hours, except for acts of God, strikes, governmental or military action, or similar conditions beyond its control, and except in circumstances for which the prior approval of the interruption is obtained from the town council, the grantee shall provide a ten percent rebate of that month's fees to affected subscribers.

The town council shall notify the grantee during the first month of the three-month period that the system has failed to meet standards. 
(j)  For failure to complete construction and installation of the system as provided for in Section 5.08.080, unless the town council approves the delay because of reasons beyond the control of the grantee, the franchise term shall be reduced by one year for each three months of delay. The town council shall notify the grantee during the first month of the three-month period that the system has failed to meet standards.

Each franchisee shall be deemed to have contractually committed itself to comply with the terms, conditions and provisions of the franchise documents, and with all rules, orders, regulations, and determinations applicable to the franchise which are issued, promulgated or made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The regulatory authority conferred by the provisions of this chapter, including the power to issue regulations and to amend the provisions of this chapter as reserved under Section 5.10.270, shall constitute a reserved authority to the agency under any franchise issued by the agency. No franchisee under any franchise issued by the agency shall have any right to restrain, restrict or delimit the right or power of the constituent jurisdictions to amend the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.060 - Franchise areas. 
    The franchise area for any franchise issued by the agency under the provisions of this chapter shall be defined by the board of directors of the agency.

(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.080 - Authority. 
    With respect to the county and municipalities enacting this chapter, it is declared that this chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority conferred by their charters, as applicable, and pursuant to the police powers conferred by Article X, Section 7 of the California Constitution for the promotion and protection of the peace, health, safety and general welfare of the citizens within their respective constituent jurisdictions. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.090 - Future incorporations/withdrawals. 
(a)  It is declared that the unified process for the administration of franchises issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter is necessary for protection and promotion of the convenience and welfare of all of the citizens of the Marin community, and that fragmentation in administration or right to administer such franchises resulting from the future incorporation of municipalities within the unincorporated area of the county or from the unilateral withdrawal of constituent jurisdictions from membership in the agency would be detrimental to the convenience and welfare and the purposes of this chapter. 
(b)  Therefore, the incorporation of any municipality within the unincorporated area of the county or the withdrawal of any constituent jurisdictions from membership in the agency (not resulting in the termination of the agency) during the initial term of any franchise issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall not operate to either divest the franchisee of its authority to install or provide services through its telecommunications facilities within the newly incorporated or withdrawing area or vest the newly created municipality or the withdrawing constituent jurisdiction with any administrative or other authority whatsoever respecting operations by the franchisee under the franchise. During such initial term, the agency shall continue to administer the provisions of this chapter for the benefit of the inhabitants of a newly incorporated or withdrawing area in the same manner as if the area had not been incorporated or if the constituent jurisdiction had not withdrawn except that the net franchise fees allocable to the newly incorporated area shall be paid to the newly incorporated jurisdiction rather than to the constituent jurisdictions from which is was formed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a duly appointed member of the governing body of a withdrawing jurisdiction may continue to participate and vote in actions coming before the agency after withdrawal which pertain solely and exclusively to a franchise in which a franchise has installed and is providing services through at least a portion of its telecommunications facilities, which are located within the jurisdiction of the withdrawing jurisdiction (such a franchise hereinafter an "affecting franchise"), provided that nothing in this sentence shall authorize the member appointed by the withdrawing jurisdiction to participate or vote in any matters pertaining to or having an effect upon more than a single affecting franchise. In the event that a constituent jurisdiction should withdraw and that withdrawal should become effective before a cable television franchise assigned to the agency as a part of its initial entry shall have been removed, extended or otherwise materially amended, the agency shall reassign such franchise and the franchise fees derived therefrom shall continue to be paid to the constituent jurisdiction which was the franchisor prior to the effective date. 
(c)  Upon expiration of the initial term of a franchise, the provisions of this chapter shall cease to be applicable to that portion of the telecommunications facilities and the operations by the franchisee thereof within the municipal limits of any municipality which is incorporated subsequent to the commencement of the initial term or within the territorial limits of any constituent jurisdiction which has unilaterally withdrawn from membership in the agency. The Marin community shall not be deemed to include any area within the limits of a municipality incorporated after the date this chapter becomes effective and prior to the filing of the certificate of acceptance of any franchise. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.100 - Annexations. 
(a)  The annexation by a municipality which has either not enacted this chapter or is not a member of the agency of unincorporated area of the county during the initial term of any franchise issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall not operate to either divest the franchisee of its authority to install or provide services through its telecommunications facilities within the annexed area or vest the municipality with any administrative or other authority whatsoever respecting operations by the franchisee under the franchise. During the initial term, the agency shall continue to administer the provisions of this chapter for the benefit of the inhabitants of the annexed area in the same manner as if the area had not been annexed. 
(b)  Upon expiration of the initial term of a franchise, the provisions of this chapter shall cease to be applicable to that portion of the telecommunications facilities and the operations by the franchisee thereof within any area which has been annexed by such a municipality. The Marin community shall not be deemed to include any area annexed by such a municipality subsequent to the date this chapter becomes effective and prior to the filing of the certificate of any franchise. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.110 - Ordinances-Police power. 
    All zoning and other land use ordinances, building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical codes, business license ordinances and all other ordinances of general application now in existence or hereafter enacted by the governing bodies of the constituent jurisdictions (hereinafter "ordinances") shall be fully applicable to the exercise of any franchise issued by the agency pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and the franchisee shall comply therewith. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this chapter or a franchise issued by the agency pursuant hereto and those of any specific provision of the ordinances of a constituent jurisdiction, the specific provisions of such ordinances shall prevail. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.120 - Operability-Amendments. 
(a)  The provisions of this chapter shall not become effective or operable unless such provisions are enacted in substantially identical form by (1) the county of Marin, (2) the city of Rafael, and (3) at least six of the remaining constituent jurisdictions and become fully effective therein on or before July 1, 1998. If the provisions of this chapter are enacted in substantially identical form by (1) the county of Marin, (2) the city of San Rafael, and (3) at least six of the remaining constituent jurisdictions and become fully effective therein on or before July 1, 1998, the provisions of this chapter shall become effective and the Agency shall come into existence on July 1, 1998 (hereinafter "the effective date"). As to those constituent jurisdictions which enact the provisions of this chapter after the effective date, the provisions of this chapter shall become applicable within the geographic boundaries of each of the constituent jurisdictions upon the enactment of the governing body of each such constituent jurisdiction of the provisions of this chapter in substantially identical form. 
(b)  From and after the effective date, no addition to, deletion from, alteration of the provisions of, repeal or other amendment of this chapter shall become effective unless each amendment or repeal is enacted by the governing body of a majority of the constituent jurisdictions who are then members of the agency. After enactment of the provisions of this chapter by a governing body of a constituent jurisdiction, no addition to, deletion from, alteration of the provisions of, repeal or other amendment of this chapter enacted by the governing bodies of the other constituent jurisdictions shall become effective within the boundaries of any of such constituent jurisdictions unless and until such amendment is enacted by the governing body of the particular constituent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.130 - Right to amend. 
    Except as hereinafter provided, in the absence of an emergency, and without the consent of the franchisee, the provisions of this chapter shall not be altered or repealed as applied to a franchise issued by the agency for which a certificate of acceptance has been filed in compliance with the provisions of thereof and in advance of the effective date of the alteration or repeal. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.140 - Franchisor. 
    Any franchise issued by the agency pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be in the name of the agency as the franchisor. Any franchise issued by any of the constituent jurisdictions prior to the effective date hereof shall be deemed to merge into and devolve upon the agency as of the effective date hereof pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.10.260 of this chapter and shall thereafter be deemed to be in the name of the agency as franchisor, provided that the cable television franchise issued by Novato to Chambers Cable of Southern Cal., Inc., an Oregon corporation, shall not be deemed to merge into and devolve upon the agency except upon (1) the option of Novato or (2) the date upon which it comes under substantially common ownership with the TCI franchises issued by the other constituent jurisdictions and provided further that until such time as that franchise shall have been renewed, extended or otherwise materially amended, the agency shall direct the franchisee to pay all franchise fees due thereunder directly to the constituent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.150 - Communications with regulatory agencies. 
    Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted by a franchisee to the FCC, Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Utilities Commission or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting construction or operation of telecommunications facilities within the Marin community, also shall be filed simultaneously with the clerk of the board of directors of the agency. Copies of responses or any other communications from the regulatory agencies to a franchisee relating to such matters shall likewise be filed immediately on receipt with the clerk. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.160 - Right of intervention. 
    The agency shall have the right of intervention in any suit or proceedings touching upon telecommunications facilities within the Marin community to any degree whatsoever and to which a franchisee is a party, and the franchisee shall not oppose such intervention by the agency.

5.10.170 - Limitation of actions. 
(a)  Except as otherwise expressly provided by this chapter, any judicial proceeding, whether for the recovery of damages or otherwise, brought for the purpose of adjudicating the validity of any provision of this chapter or amendments thereof shall be commenced not later than thirty calendar days following the effective date hereof. Any such judicial proceeding brought for the purpose of adjudicating the validity of any ordinance, resolution, rule, order, regulation, determination or arbitration award of the agency which purports to have been made pursuant to the delegation of the provisions of this chapter or pursuant to the provisions of any of the other franchise documents shall be commenced not later than thirty calendar days following date of enactment, adoption, issuance or making of such ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, determination or arbitration award. No judicial proceeding shall be commenced in violation of the limitations prescribed by this section. 
(b)  The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any judicial proceeding, whether for the recovery of damages or otherwise, commenced by the agency, county or municipalities for breach or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation, determination or arbitration award purporting to have been issued thereunder. 
(Ord. 829 § 1 (part), 1998) 
5.10.180 - Changes in law. 
    Should the state of California or any agency thereof, the United States or any federal agency or any state or federal court require either the agency, county, municipalities or a franchisee to act in a manner which is inconsistent with any provisions of the franchise documents relating to any franchise or withdraw or otherwise impair the authority of the agency to act in respect to the provisions of the franchise documents relating to any franchise, the board of directors of the agency shall be authorized to determine whether a material provision of the franchise documents is affected in relation to the rights and benefits conferred by the franchise documents upon the agency, county, municipalities or the public. Upon such determination, the franchise documents shall be subject to modification or amendment to such extent as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the full intent and purposes thereof in relation to the rights and benefits of the agency, county, municipalities or the public and in relation to such state, federal or judicial requirement. The board of directors of the agency may terminate a franchise issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter if it determines after consultation with the franchisee that substantial and material compliance with the franchise documents in relation to the rights or benefits of the agency, county, municipalities or the public has been frustrated by such a state, federal or judicial requirement.

Chapter 5.30 - TENANT ANTI-DISCRIMINATION PROTECTION RIGHTS 
Sections: 

5.30.010 - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Housing is an essential requirement for all residents of an urban area. Policy 4.6.a. of the town of Corte Madera general plan states: "Work to ensure that individuals and families seeking housing in Corte Madera are not discriminated against on the basis of age, sex, family structure, national origin, or other arbitrary/factors." Town policies are consistent with state housing law, and the state legislature has declared, in part, that "the availability of housing is of vital statewide importance..." 
(b)  The Marin Housing Authority, which administers the Section 8 rent subsidy program, reports a shortage of landlords participating in the Section 8 program, that many Corte Madera tenants are on the waiting list for Section 8 rental assistance, and that many tenants who qualify for Section 8 rental assistance are unable to benefit from it because of the unavailability of participating landlords. 
(c)  Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to encourage landlords to participate in the Marin County Housing Authority Section 8 rent subsidy program and to establish a right of existing tenants to be free of certain discrimination based on their use of a rental subsidy. 
(Ord. 858 § 1, 2000) 
5.30.020 - Right to protection against discrimination in rental housing on the basis of source of income. 
    It is unlawful for the owner or manager of rental housing to discriminate against an existing tenant on the basis of that tenant's use of a Section 8 rent subsidy. It is a violation of this prohibition for a property owner or manager to refuse to accept a Section 8 rent subsidy for which an existing tenant qualifies, or to terminate the tenancy of an existing tenant based on the property owner's or manager's refusal to participate in a Section 8 rent subsidy program for which an existing tenant has qualified. 
(Ord. 858 § 2, 2000) 
5.30.030 - Exceptions. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply to rental or leasing of any housing unit located in a structure or on the same property containing ten or fewer dwelling units. 
(Ord. 858 § 3, 2000) 
5.30.040 - Redress. 
(a)  A person whose rights have been violated under this chapter may not commence a civil action to enforce those rights unless he or she has first offered to mediate the controversy. The complainant's obligations under this section shall be met if the complainant (1) offers to mediate the controversy under the auspices of Marin County Mediation Services, Fair Housing of Marin, or any free mediation service that the town may establish for this purpose in the future, and (2) mediates in good faith. The complainant's obligations under this section shall be deemed satisfied if the opposing party does not agree to mediation within fourteen days after being requested to mediate, or if no mediated resolution is reached within thirty days after being requested to mediate, despite the complainant's good faith efforts. 
(b)  If a complaint of discrimination under this chapter is not resolved through mediation, and the complainant has complied with his or her responsibilities under subsection A of this section, the complainant has the right to initiate a civil action for damages and injunctive relief. The litigating complainant shall file a courtesy copy of the lawsuit with the town's director of environmental services. 
(Ord. 858 § 4, 2000) 
5.30.050 - Liability. 
(a)  The town shall not be liable for any damages, costs, or expenses which are the result of any act or omission of or any decision made by any person (e.g., mediator, arbitrator, or court) concerning an anti-discrimination right claim or a complainant's assertions pertaining to rights granted or conferred by this chapter. 
(b)  Under no circumstances shall the town have any responsibility or liability to enforce this chapter or to seek any legal redress, civil or criminal, for any decision it or any other person makes concerning an anti-discrimination claim. 
(c)  Violations of this chapter shall not constitute a crime.

Further, no certificate to operate shall be issued until there is presented to the county health officer satisfactory evidence that each and every employee of the establishment has had, within the preceding twelve months, an appropriate test indicating freedom from tuberculosis in a communicable stage. Such test shall be a negative minifilm or other x-ray of the chest or a negative tuberculin skin test. If the test done to satisfy this requirement does not definitely indicate freedom from contagious tuberculosis and further medical investigation of the food handler is necessary in order to reach a definite conclusion, the food handler may, at the discretion of the health officer, continue to work pending completion of necessary medical studies, if, in the opinion of the health officer, no public health hazard will arise as a result of the individual's continued employment as a food handler. If a food establishment has in its employ one or more persons who are being allowed by the health officer to continue to work pending completion of tests to determine the presence or absence of contagious tuberculosis, such establishment shall be issued a certificate that shall expire at a date determined by the health officer but not later than three months from date of issuance.

After the hearing a reasonable time shall be allowed by the health officer for correction of the violations. During that correctional period the certificate may be suspended, and the food establishment may be ordered closed during the suspension if the health officer deems such action necessary for the protection of the public health. The suspension shall be lifted if full compliance with sanitary requirements is obtained at the end of the time allowed; if compliance is not obtained, the certificate shall then be revoked. 
    After the issuance of any certificate hereunder, and during the full life of such certificate, no person shall be employed in such food establishment except those who the health officer shall have cleared or approved at the time of such certification, or other personnel who shall have been certificated or approved by him thereafter, but prior to commencing work.

It is the intent of the town council in adopting this ordinance that the enforcement officer provide a violator that is covered by this section with guidance, suggestions, and an additional opportunity to implement such guidance or suggestions which may better enable the violation to be removed or corrected by the responsible party at its own expense without the need for coercive action to be taken by the town. 
3.

The administrative penalty in the amount set forth by the administrative citation, if an appeal is not requested in a timely manner, or as ordered by the planning commission, if the matter is timely appealed, shall be paid to the town within thirty days of service of the administrative citation or decision of the planning commission, unless an extension of time is requested by the responsible party and granted by the town manager. The administrative penalty shall constitute a debt owed to the town. In addition to all other means of enforcement, such penalties may be enforced as a personal obligation of the responsible party. Payment of the administrative penalty shall not excuse or permit any continuation or repeated occurrence of the violation that is the subject of the administrative citation. 
B.  If the violation is connected with real property and the Responsible Party is an owner of the real property, the administrative penalty may be enforced by imposition of a lien on the real property.

E.  The remedies set forth in this section are not exclusive. The town may collect administrative penalties by the use of the small claims court or by any other legal remedy.

9.33.030 - Definitions. 
(a)  Any terms defined in the Phase II Stormwater Permit, the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.) and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, and/or defined in the regulations for the stormwater discharge permitting program issued by the Environmental Protection Agency on November 16, 1990 (as may from time to time be amended) and used in this chapter shall have the same meaning as in said Act or regulations. In the event of a conflict in terms or definitions, the terms and definitions used in the Clean Water Act shall prevail. Such terms include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  "Authorized enforcement official" means the town manager, and/or the town manager's duly authorized officers and agents. 
(2)  "BASMAA Post Construction Manual" shall mean the most recent version of the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies (BASMAA) Post Construction Manual which provides design guidelines for reducing stormwater pollutant discharges through the construction, operation and maintenance of source control measures, low impact development design, site design measures, stormwater treatment measures and hydromodification management measures. 
(3)  "Best management practices (BMPs)" means schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to waters of the United States. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste recycling or disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. 
(4)  "Construction activity" means any activity that involves soil disturbing activities including, but not limited to, clearing, paving, grading, disturbances to ground such as stockpiling, and excavation. 
(5)  "Discharge of a pollutant" means: 
(A)  The addition of any pollutant or combination of pollutants to waters of the United States from any point source; or 
(B)  Any addition of any pollutant or combination of pollutants to the waters of an adjacent contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft which is being used as a means of transportation. The term includes additions of pollutants to waters of the United States from: surface runoff which is collected or channeled by man; discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances owned by a state, municipality, or other person which do not lead to a treatment works; and discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances, leading into privately owned treatment works. 
(6)  "Discharger" means a person or entity who or which, respectively, performs, causes or permits to occur a discharge. 
(7)  "Illicit connection" means any device or method that conveys non-stormwater to a municipal separate storm sewer (storm drain) system (MS4) or receiving water. 
(8)  "Illicit discharge" means any discharge to a municipal separate sewer (storm drain) system (MS4) that is prohibited under local, state, or federal statutes, ordinances, codes, or regulations. The term illicit discharge includes all non-stormwater discharges not composed entirely of stormwater and discharges that are identified under the exceptions to discharge prohibition section of this chapter. The term illicit discharge does not include discharges that are regulated by an NPDES permit (other than the NPDES permit for discharges from the MS4).

Water leaving an intended use area is not considered incidental if it is part of the facility design, if it is due to excessive application, if it is due to intentional overflow or application, or if it is due to negligence. 
(10)  "Low impact development (LID)" means a sustainable practice that benefits water supply and contributes to water quality protection. LID uses site design and stormwater management to maintain the site's pre-development runoff rates and volumes. The goal of LID is to mimic a site's predevelopment hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to the source of rainfall. 
(11)  "Maximum extent practicable (MEP)" means the minimum required performance standards, BMPs, control techniques and systems, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator or the state determines appropriate for reducing pollutants in stormwater. MEP is the cumulative effect of implementing, evaluating, and making corresponding changes to a variety of technically appropriate and economically feasible BMPs, ensuring that the most appropriate controls are implemented in the most effective manner. This process of implementing, evaluation, revising, or adding new BMPs is commonly referred to as the iterative process. 
(12)  "MCSTOPPP" is the Marin County Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program.

Chapter 9.36 - NOISE 
Sections: 

9.36.010 - Declaration of policy. 
    It shall be the policy of the town to prohibit unnecessary, excessive and annoying noises from all sources. At certain levels noises are detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry and in the public interest should be systematically proscribed. 
(Ord. 668 § 1, 1978) 
9.36.020 - Definitions. 
    Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
(1)  "Ambient noise" means the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from any sources, near and far. For the purpose of this code, ambient noise level is the average over fifteen minutes excluding random or intermittent noises and the alleged offensive noise measured at the location and time of day at which a comparison with an alleged offensive noise is to be made. Averaging may be done by instrumental analysis in accordance with American National Standards S.13-1971, or may be done manually as follows: 
(A)  Observe a sound level meter for five seconds and record the best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest and lowest indications; 
(B)  Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to provide that observations be made at the beginning and at the end of the fifteen-minute averaging period and that there shall be at least as many additional observations as there are decibels between the lowest low indication and the highest high indication; 
(C)  Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications. 
(2)  "Decibel" means a unit for measuring the relative loudness of sounds equal approximately to the smallest degree of difference of loudness ordinarily detectable by the human ear whose range includes approximately one hundred thirty decibels on a scale beginning with one for the faintest audible sound. 
(3)  "Noise level" means the sound level in decibels dBA measured on the A-weighted scale as defined by the American National Standard Institute specifications S1.41971 or the most recent revision thereof. 
(4)  "Noise level measurement." For the purpose of enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, noise level shall be measured on the A-weighted scale with a sound level meter satisfying at least the applicable requirements for Type 1 sound level meters as defined in American National Standard Section 1.4-1971 or the most recent revisions thereof. The meter shall be set for slow response speed, except that for impulse noises or rapidly varying sound levels, fast response speed may be used. Prior to each measurement, the meter shall be verified, and adjusted to ±0.3 decibel by means of an acoustical calibrator. 
    For outside measurements the microphone shall be not less than four feet above the ground, at least four and a half feet distant from walls or similar large reflecting surfaces, and shall be protected from the effects of wind, noises and other extraneous sounds by the use of screens, shields or other appropriate devices. For inside measurements, the microphone shall be at least three feet distant from any wall, and the average sound measurement shall be determined from at least three microphone positions throughout the room. 
(5)  "Person" means a person, firm, association, co-partnership, joint venture, corporation, or any entity, public or private. 
(6)  "Powered construction equipment" means any tools, machinery or equipment used in connection with construction operations which can be driven by energy in any form other than manpower, including all types of motor vehicles when used in the construction process on any construction site, regardless of whether such construction site be located on-highway or off-highway. 
(7)  "Property plan" means the vertical line through the property line which determines the property boundaries in space. 
(8)  "Unnecessary, excessive or offensive noise" means, in the absence of specific maximum noise levels, a noise level which exceeds the ambient noise level by 5 dBA or more, when measured at the nearest property line or, in the case of multiple-family residential buildings, when measured anywhere in one dwelling unit with respect to a. noise emanating from another dwelling unit or from common space in the same building. 
(9)  "Zoning districts" shall be as defined and described in Title 18 of this code. 
(Ord. 668 § 2, 1978) 
9.36.030 - Specific maximum noise levels. 
(a)  Except as modified in subsections (c) and (d) below, it is unlawful for any person to operate any machinery or equipment, pump, fan, air-conditioning apparatus, or similar mechanical device or any radio receiving set, musical instrument, phonograph, television set, or other similar device in any manner so as to create any noise which would cause the noise level at the property plane of the property from which the noise is emitted to exceed the following values: 
TABLE 1

The applicant shall at all times comply with and shall cause all his agents and employees to comply with all such laws, ordinances, regulations, decisions, court and similar authoritative orders. 
    In some instances, the town does not own the lands which its streets traverse, its interest being limited to an easement only. Therefor, the permit covers surface operations only at all locations where the town has no subsurface rights and in such cases does not purport to authorize any excavation, laying of pipelines, setting of poles or other operations below the surface of the right-of-way.

(b)  Completion of Work. The permittee shall complete the work or use authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this title within the time specified in the permit. If at any time the director finds that the delay in the prosecution of completion of the work or use authorized is due to lack of diligence on the part of the permittee, he may cancel the permit and restore the right-of-way or watercourse to its former condition. The permittee shall reimburse the town for all expenses incurred by the director in restoring the right-of-way or watercourse. 
(Ord. 469 § 13, 1967)

(Ord. 469 § 16, 1967) 
12.08.110 - Fees. 
    The schedule of fees will be those recommended by the director of public works or his or her designee and established and adopted by the town council from time to time by resolution. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall deposit with the town cash or check in a sufficient sum to cover the fee for issuance of the permit, charges for field investigation, and the fee for necessary inspection, all in accordance with a schedule established and adopted by the town council.

Chapter 12.12 - ENCROACHMENT PERMIT DEPOSITS[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 915, § 1, adopted Oct. 20, 2009, repealed Ch. 12.12, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to this amendment, Ch. 12.12 pertained to Bonds. See Disposition of Ordinances Table for derivation. 

12.12.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to impose a requirement for the posting of an encroachment permit deposit as a condition to the issuance of an encroachment permit when the director of public works or his or her designee determines that the work to be performed under the permit will require the restoration of the right-of-way or watercourse of the town upon the completion of the work. The encroachment permit deposit required by this chapter shall be in addition to any fees or other deposits that may be established by this title or may be imposed upon the project under any other title of this Code. Encroachment permit deposits required by this chapter shall be pledged to the town for security purposes in the event of the permitee's failure or refusal to restore the right-of-way or watercourse of the town to its condition prior to the commencement of the work to be performed under the encroachment permit. Encroachment permit deposits shall be refunded or charged in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Deposits may be established and modified from time to time by the town's fees resolution proceedings but shall be maintained and processed as refundable deposits, rather than fees for services provided by the town. 
(Ord. No. 915, § 1, 10-20-2009) 
12.12.020 - Determination of deposit. 
(a)  Unless this provision is waived in the permit and before a permit is effective, no application for an encroachment permit shall be approved, and no permit shall be issued until the permittee has deposited with the director of public works or his or her designee a sum to be fixed by the director or his or her designee as sufficient to reimburse the town for costs of restoring the right-of-way or watercourse to its former condition. The director of public works or his or her designee may in his or her discretion, however, allow the permittee to file a deposit on an annual basis in a sum estimated by the director or his or her designee as sufficient to cover the permittee's activities during any twelve-month period. In which event, the permittee shall not be required to make a deposit to the town for each encroachment permit that is issued while the deposit is in effect. 
(b)  In determining the amount of the deposit required under this chapter, the director of public works or his or her designee shall consider: (1) the construction work contemplated by the applicant including its scope and the size of the project; (2) its location; (3) the nature of the contemplated construction and the type of construction procedures likely to be utilized by the applicant; (4) the type of equipment the applicant will, or is likely to, use in connection with the contemplated construction; and (5) such other factors as the director of public works or his or her designee deems relevant. 
(c)  This encroachment permit deposit shall be in addition to any other fees and deposits that may be required in connection with the work that is being permitted.

(a)  Licensee shall, prior to the issuance of any permit for construction in the public right-of-way, deliver to the town satisfactory security in the amount of one hundred ten percent of the total estimated cost of all work to be performed under such permit, as determined by the director. Such security shall consist of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or performance bond as determined by the director. The security shall be provided in the manner required by the director and maintained in full force and effect until the permitted work in the public right-of-way is completed to the satisfaction of the director, at which time the amount of the security shall be reduced to ten percent of the actual cost of the work. The reduced security shall be maintained by licensee for a period of one year as a guarantee that the work is of good quality and free from any defective or faulty material or workmanship. Any surety supplying a performance bond must be an "admitted surety insurer," as defined in Section 995.120 of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorized to do business in the state. Return of the security shall be conditioned upon licensee's faithful performance of all work in the public right-of-way specified in the applicable permit.

A sale or transfer of stock, assets, or other equitable interests of licensee, or any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of licensee, which effects a material change in licensee's ownership or control, as determined by the town, shall be deemed to be a transfer for purposes of this section. Any transfer shall be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a bill of sale, or similar document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the town clerk within thirty days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the town council to a transfer may not be unreasonably denied. Any proposed transferee must show that it has the financial, technical and legal ability to perform all obligations and requirements of the right-of-way agreement and this chapter as determined by the town council and must agree in writing to comply with all provisions of the right-of-way agreement and this chapter.

12.38.150 - Nonexclusive use-Limitations. 
(a)  Any right-of-way agreement shall be for the nonexclusive use of the public rights-of-way.

(b)  A right-of-way agreement only authorizes licensee to use the public right-of-way specifically described in one or more encroachment permits issued by the town, and the use of any other public property, whether located within or outside a public right-of-way, is strictly prohibited unless authorized by a separate agreement with the town. 
(c)  No reference herein, nor in any right-of-way agreement, shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the town that its interest or other right to control the use of the property that is the subject of a right-of-way agreement is sufficient to permit its use for the purposes specified in the agreement. Any right-of-way agreement shall be deemed to grant no more than the rights which the town may have the authority to grant. 
(d)  Any privilege claimed by licensee in any public right-of-way shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy or use of the public right-of-way. 
(e)  Licensee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the town for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this chapter or of any right-of-way agreement executed under this chapter or because of its enforcement.

(b)  Time, Place and Manner. All facilities shall be located, constructed, operated, and maintained in the time, place and manner that causes the least interference with the public's use of the public right-of-way, and the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the public rights-of-way, all as determined by and approved by the director.

(f)  Pole Attachments. Where existing poles or other wire-holding structures are available for use, the town council may require such poles and structures to be used if the council determines that the public convenience would be enhanced by such installation, and the terms of the use are just and reasonable. 
(g)  Aboveground Installations. Installations of any aboveground equipment pursuant to a right-of-way agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter, such as amplifiers and cabinet boxes, shall be subject to the prior approval of the director.

All persons receiving such notice shall have thirty days from the date thereof to inform in writing the town and applicant sending the notice that such person desires to perform work jointly with the applicant. All work jointly performed by other persons shall be performed pursuant to right-of-way agreements and all required encroachment and excavation permits. The failure to timely respond to the notice and timely obtain the necessary right-of-way agreement and permits shall result in the person receiving the notice being prohibited from working in the designated right-of-way for a period of one year from the date that the work described in the notice is completed.

(c)  Neither the execution of a right-of-way agreement nor any provisions of this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar the exercise of any governmental right or power of the town, including the town's authority to make any proper public use of the public right-of-way. 
(d)  The town council and the director may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of the town's jurisdiction under this chapter.

12.48.070 - Action on application. 
    The special event coordinator shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application for the grounds specified in Section 12.48.080. Such action shall be taken no later than ten days after receiving a completed application unless time is waived by the applicant. If the application is denied, the special event coordinator shall inform the applicant of the grounds for the denial, or the reasons for a change in the date, time, route, or location of the event, and of his right of appeal pursuant to Section 12.48.160. If there is insufficient time to process, investigate and/or obtain police services for a late application, the special events coordinator shall inform the applicant of the reason for his refusal to process the late application within two business days of receipt thereof. 
(Ord. 822 § 1 (part), 1997) 
12.48.080 - Grounds for application denial. 
(a)  The special event coordinator shall approve an application for a special event permit unless he determines from consideration of the application, or other pertinent information, that one or more of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Information contained in the application, or supplemental information requested from the applicant, is found to be false in any material detail; 
(2)  The applicant fails to complete his application within three working days of the date he is notified by the special event coordinator that additional information or documents needed for the application to be complete under this chapter. The special event coordinator shall allow additional time for completing the application if sufficient time would remain to process and investigate the application, and obtain police services for the event; 
(3)  The special event coordinator has earlier received an application to hold another event at the same time and place requested by the applicant, or so close in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the police department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both events; 
(4)  The time, route, or size of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion unless closure of the involved street has been authorized under Section 12.48.140; 
(5)  The concentration of persons, and/or vehicles at the site of the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around an event, will prevent proper police, fire, or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the event; 
(6)  The size or nature of the event will require the assignment of so great a number of police officers to properly police the line of movement of an event, or the boundaries or areas contiguous to an event, as to prevent normal police protection to the rest of the town. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, if reasonable permit conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of event participants with the number of police officers available to police the event; 
(7)  The location of the event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along town streets, or a previously granted encroachment permit; 
(8)  The parade, or other event moving along a route, is not reasonably likely to move from its point of origin to its point of termination in four hours or less; 
(9)  The special event would violate federal, state or local laws including licensing or permit requirements. 
(b)  When the grounds for denial of an application for a permit specified in subdivisions (a)(3) through (a)(9) of this section, can be corrected by altering the date, time, duration, route, or location of the event, the special event coordinator shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application upon the applicant's acceptance of conditions for permit issuance. 
(Ord. 822 § 1 (part), 1997) 
12.48.090 - Permit conditions. 
    The special event coordinator may condition the issuance of a special event permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the time, place, and manner of the event, and such requirements as are necessary to protect the safety of persons and property, and the control of traffic; provided, such conditions shall not unnecessarily restrict the right of free speech. Such conditions include: 
(1)  Alteration of the route, time, or location of the event proposed on the event application; 
(2)  Conditions concerning accommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, use of traffic cones or barricades; 
(3)  Requirements for provision of first aid, sanitary or emergency facilities;

(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 11-15-2016) 
15.02.120 - Findings. 
    To the extent that any of the provisions of this Chapter constitute changes or modifications in the requirements contained in Health and Safety Code Section 17922, the Corte Madera Town Council does hereby find that such changes and modifications are reasonably necessary because of local conditions prevailing within the Town of Corte Madera. A description of said local conditions is hereinafter set forth. 
    CLIMATIC. The weather patterns within the Town of Corte Madera are considered to be moderately affected by the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay, which extends the year-round growing season of vegetation. The normal year's rainfall is approximately 28 inches, while the summer condition, with its prevalent Pacific high cell, creates the morning and late afternoon fog normally associated with the San Francisco Bay. 
    While normal temperatures usually do not exceed 75-80 degrees during the summer months, little or no rain falls during the period between April and November. This combination often creates hazardous fuel conditions in the town. Drying winds in the summer and fall months reduce fuel moisture and relative humidity to the minimum levels, thereby creating ideal fire weather conditions. The normal afternoon winds that precede the fog can move a fire quickly in the hillside and open space areas of the town. 
    Because of climatic conditions, the County of Marin has experienced water rationing in recent years, including a mandatory 35 percent reduction in 1989. Water shortages can be expected in future years due to limited storage capacities in Marin, increased domestic consumption and weather patterns that reduce the already minimal annual rainfall. While sound management of the water resources is possible, actual demands on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted. 
    GEOLOGIC. The Town of Corte Madera is geologically mixed with three classifications of rock: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The outstanding material is volcanic in origin with ridges of serpentine reaching in excess of 700 feet in elevation. 
    Much of the town is characterized by precipitous hilly areas where escape opportunities from residential structures are limited to one side of the home only. The steepness and uneven nature of the land often hinders, and sometimes prevents, the erecting of rescue ladders at the side of a home on a hillside parcel. 
    Seismic activity within the town occurs yearly with little or no damage, although a real potential does exist with the town situated between two active faults: the San Andreas and Hayward faults. 
    Landslides have also been experienced in the town in recent years. While stabilization of hillsides can sometimes be achieved, heavy rainfalls have caused failures. These slides can close roadways, making accessibility to many locations in the town impossible until properly cleared. 
    TOPOGRAPHIC. The town is accessible from the outside by one primary thoroughfare on the east side and three on the west side. Speed limits of 25 miles per hour, by virtue of the narrow and twisting configuration of the roads, do not allow quick responses to emergencies. The Highway 101 corridor goes directly through the town and an overpass that may or may not withstand an earthquake presents another problem. 
    Vehicular access within the town is affected by steep, hilly terrain and many secondary ridgelines. Many streets are narrow and winding, restricting the speed at which fire apparatus may safely respond and also increasing the time lapse between fire detection and apparatus arrival, during which time a family will face the fire or other emergency on their own. The town has many dead-end streets, and on Christmas Tree Hill, there is one main access route in or out of the area. Dead-end streets can restrict the ease of relocating fire and rescue equipment from one location to another, even though actual separating distance between two areas may be minimal. In addition to restricting access routes for fire apparatus, the dead-end streets also limit egress opportunities for residents. 
    Many of the commercial buildings in Corte Madera were largely built long before present code requirements existed. Consequently, many of these structures do not meet even minimal standards for fire protection and life safety. Wood frame construction of older buildings, especially those in mountainous areas, creates an adverse exposure problem, not only in being easily ignited by an adjacent structure fire, but also in contributing to the extension of fire to other buildings through radiation, actual physical heat conduction and flying embers. Fire history in the town has shown flying embers will start secondary fires after blowing in the air. 
    Throughout the town, there are areas in which there are no water mains constructed at all. Meadow Valley has no water main supply, other than domestic, and there is minimal water supply along Casa Buena Drive, fronting the auto dealerships and the other major commercial establishments. 
    The buildings on Christmas Tree Hill, many of which were constructed 50 or more years ago, are serviced by minimal water main sizes. The lack of adequate water supply in this area, along with winding streets, creates a unique fire problem. The generalized water shortage in Marin County results in occasional inadequate water volume and pressure for firefighting purposes in certain areas of the town. 
(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 11-15-2016) 
15.02.130 - Appeals. 
    Whenever the Fire Code Official disapproves an application or refuses to grant a permit applied for, or when it is claimed that the provisions of the code do not apply or that the true intent and meaning of the code have been misconstrued or wrongly interpreted, the applicant may appeal from the decision of the Fire Code Official to the Town Council in writing, within 30 days from the date of the decision appealed. The Town Council shall render decisions and findings in writing to the Fire Code Official, with a duplicate copy to the appellant. 
(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 11-15-2016) 
15.02.140 - Penalties. 
(a)  Any person who violates any of the provisions of the California Fire Code, as adopted and amended herein, or any other section, subsection, or provision of this chapter, or fails to comply therewith, or who violates or fails to comply with any order made thereunder, or who builds in violation of any detailed statement of specifications or plans submitted and approved thereunder, or any certificate or permit issued thereunder, and from which no appeal has been taken, or who fails to comply with such an order as affirmed or modified by the Fire Code Official, or by a court of competent jurisdiction, within the required time, shall severally for each and every such violation and noncompliance, respectively, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 180 days or by both such fine and imprisonment. The prosecuting authority may, however, in its discretion charge or reduce any violation to an infraction punishable as stated by Government Code Section 36900(c). The imposition of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a reasonable time; and, when not otherwise specified, each ten days that prohibited conditions are maintained shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  The application of the above penalty shall not be held to prevent the enforced removal of prohibited conditions. 
(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 11-15-2016) 
15.02.150 - Former ordinances.

(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 11-15-2016) 
15.02.160 - Validity. 
    By adoption of this chapter the Town Council does not intend to create, establish, or impose any mandatory duty or liability on the part of the town, its officers, employees, or any other person acting on its behalf, notwithstanding the use of "shall", "will", "must", or similar terms within this chapter.

Chapter 5. 
MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION METHODS FOR EXTERIOR WILDFIRE EXPOSURE 
SECTION 501 SCOPE, PURPOSE AND APPLICATION 
501.1 - Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish minimum standards for the protection of life and property by increasing the ability of a building located in any Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area to resist the intrusion of flame or burning embers projected by a vegetation fire and to contribute to a systematic reduction in conflagration losses. 
501.2 - Scope. This chapter provides those building materials, systems, and/or assemblies that may be used in the exterior design and construction of new or relocated buildings or buildings meeting the definition of substantial remodel - exterior within a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area as defined in Section 202. 
Exceptions: 
1. Accessory structures not exceeding 120 square feet in floor area when located at least 50 feet from buildings containing habitable spaces. 
501.3. Application. 
The building standards of Chapter 7A of the California Building Code will apply to construction in a designated wildland-urban interface fire area of a new building or structure, or a building or structure where all additions and or alterations considered cumulatively over a continuous 24 month period would meet the definition of a substantial remodel - exterior, and all building permit applications for work within the 24-month period were submitted on or after the effective date of Ordinance Number 905 (April 18, 2008). 
Exception: The building standards of Chapter 7A shall not apply to projects for which a development application has been deemed "complete" prior to the effective date of Ordinance Number 905 (April 18, 2008). 
Exceptions to these provisions may be granted by the Chief when alternate means of protection are provided as approved by the Chief.

15.04.070 - Amendments made to Chapter 6 of the 2006 International Wildland-Urban Interface Code. 
SECTION 603 DEFENSIBLE SPACE 
603.1 Objective. Provisions of this section are intended to modify the fuel load, type, and configuration in areas adjacent to structures to create a defensible space. 
603.2 Fuel modification. In order to qualify as a conforming defensible space, fuel modification shall be provided as specified in Fire Protection Standards approved by the Chief. Distances specified in Fire Protection Standards may be modified by the code official because of a site-specific analysis based on local conditions and the fire protection plan. Persons owning, leasing, controlling, operating or maintaining buildings or structures requiring defensible spaces are responsible for modifying or removing non fire-resistive vegetation on the property owned, leased or controlled by said person. In accordance with Government Code section 51182(b), a person is not required under this section to maintain any defensible space on any property that the person does not have the legal right to maintain, nor is any person required to enter upon or to damage property that is owned by any other person without the consent of the owner of the property. 
Trees are allowed within the defensible space, provided the horizontal distance between crowns of adjacent trees and crowns of trees and structures, overhead electrical facilities or unmodified fuel is not less than 10 feet. Deadwood and litter shall be regularly removed from trees. 
Where ornamental vegetative fuels or cultivated ground cover, such as green grass, ivy, succulents or similar plants are used as ground cover, they are allowed to be within the designated defensible space, provided they do not form a means of transmitting fire from the native growth to any structure.

(a)  Precipitation. Precipitation ranges from fifteen to forty-two inches per year with an average of approximately twenty-five inches per year. Approximately ninety percent falls during the months of November through April, and ten percent from May through October. 
(b)  Relative Humidity. Humidity generally ranges from fifty percent during daytime to eight-six percent at night. It drops to twenty percent during the summer months and occasionally drops lower. 
(c)  Temperatures. Temperatures have been recorded as high as one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit. Average summer highs are in the seventy-eight degree to eighty-five degree range. 
(d)  Winds. Prevailing winds are from the northwest. However, winds are experienced from virtually every direction at one time or another. Velocities are generally in the five to fifteen mph range, gusting to twenty to thirty mph, particularly during the summer months. Extreme winds, up to fifty mph, have been known to occur. 
(e)  Summary. These local climatic conditions accelerate the speed, intensify the degree, and increase the size, of fire in the community. Wood shake and shingle roof types proliferate within the town. Times of little or no rainfall, of low humidity and high temperatures create extremely hazardous conditions, particularly as they relate to wood shake and shingle roof fires and conflagrations. The winds experienced in this area can have a tremendous impact upon structure fires of buildings in close proximity to one another, commonly found in Corte Madera. During wood shake and shingle roof fires, or exposure fires, strong winds, such as those regularly experienced by the town, can carry sparks and burning brands to other structures in close proximity, thus spreading the fire and causing conflagrations. In building fires, strong winds can literally force fires back into the building and can create a blowtorch effect, in addition to preventing "natural" ventilation and cross-ventilation efforts. These conditions make it difficult to stop a fire after it has begun, increases the need to rapidly reach the fire before it spreads or intensifies, and increases the risks of property damage, personal injury and loss of life resulting from the fire. 
(2)  Geologic. 
(a)  The fire environment of a community is primarily a combination of two factors: the area's physical geologic characteristics and the historic pattern of urban-suburban development. These two factors, alone and combined, create a mixture of environments which ultimately determines the area's fire protection needs. 
(b)  Landslides have also been experienced in the town. While stabilization of hillsides can sometimes be achieved, heavy rainfalls have caused failures. These slides can close roadways, making accessibility to many locations in the town impossible until properly cleared. 
(c)  The relatively young geological processes that have created the San Francisco Bay Area are still active today. The district sits between two active earthquake faults (San Andreas and the Hayward/-Calaveras) and numerous potentially active faults. One hundred percent of the town is in the strong to violent seismic hazard zones. 
(d)  Fire following an earthquake has the potential of causing greater loss of life and damage than the earthquake itself. The majority of the town's industrial complexes are located in the highest seismic risk zones. The highest seismic risk zone also contains the largest concentration of hazardous materials. Hazardous materials, particularly toxic gases, could pose the greatest threat to the largest number, should a significant seismic event occur. The town's resources would have to be prioritized to mitigate the greatest threat, and may likely be unavailable for smaller single-dwelling or structure fires. The greater risk of earthquakes results in a higher likelihood of a fire which could lead to substantial damage or loss of life within the town. 
(3)  Topographic. 
(a)  Because of the differing topography of Corte Madera, the characteristics of the fire environment changes from one location to the next. Therefore, the town has not one, but a number of fire environments, each of which has its individual fire protection needs. 
(b)  The service area of the Corte Madera has a varied topography and vegetative cover. A conglomeration of bay plains, hills and ridges make up the terrain. Development has occurred on the flat lands in the central portion of the district. Development in the hillside areas on the west and south sides of town is predominantly limited to residential remodeling and additions. 
(c)  Many of the buildings in Corte Madera were built long before present code requirements existed. Consequently, many of these structures do not meet even minimal standards for fire protection and life safety. Wood frame construction of older buildings, especially those in mountainous areas, creates an adverse exposure problem, not only in being easily ignited by an adjacent structure fire, but also in contributing to the extension of fire to other buildings through radiation, actual physical heat conduction and flying embers. Fire history in the town has shown flying embers will start secondary fires after blowing in the air. 
(d)  Much of the town is characterized by precipitous hilly areas where escape opportunities from residential structures are limited to one side of the home only. The steepness and uneven nature of the land often hinders, and sometimes prevents, the erecting of rescue ladders at the side of a home on a hillside parcel. 
(e)  Vehicular access within the town is affected by steep, hilly terrain and many secondary ridgelines. Many streets are narrow and winding, restricting the speed at which fire apparatus may safely respond and also increasing the time lapse between fire detection and apparatus arrival, during which time a family will face the fire or other emergency on their own. The town has many dead-end streets, and on Christmas Tree Hill, there is one main access route in or out of the area. Dead-end streets can restrict the ease of relocating fire and rescue equipment from one location to another, even though actual separating distance between two areas may be minimal. In addition to restricting access routes for fire apparatus, the dead-end streets also limit egress opportunities for residents. 
(f)  The town is accessible from the outside by one primary thoroughfare on the east side and three on the west side. Speed limits of twenty-five miles per hour, by virtue of the narrow and twisting configuration of the roads, do not allow quick responses to emergencies. The Highway 101 corridor goes directly through the town and an overpass that may or may not withstand an earthquake presents another problem. 
(g)  There is much diversity in slope percentages. Christmas Tree Hill slopes run from nearly level to over seventy percent. 
(h)  Corte Madera's semi-arid Mediterranean-type climate produces vegetation similar to that of most of Marin County, with specific growth locale a result of topography and prevailing wind. The south facing exposure is primarily rye grass, highly flammable brush, with occasional clumps of bay and oak trees in the more sheltered pockets. The north facing slopes are heavily wooded from lower elevations to ridge with oak and bay trees and minor shrubs of the general chaparral class. 
(i)  Historic development of the residential community extended into areas of heavier vegetation and has resulted in homes existing in close proximity to dense natural foliage. Often such dwellings are completely surrounded by highly combustible vegetation compounding the fire problem from a conflagration point of view. Of particular recent note is the increase in dead down fuel and litter accumulation directly associated with the dead oak syndrome, which has heightened the risk of fire being caused and spreading in many areas of the town. 
(4)  Summary. The above local climatic, geologic, and topographic conditions serve to increase the magnitude, exposure, and access problems characteristic of fire hazards existing within the town of Corte Madera. 
    Other special circumstances that may tend to increase and intensify the fire hazards facing the town are: 
(a)  The extent of damage that may be done to the water system serving properties in the area in times of fire. There are areas within the town in which there are no water mains at all constructed. Meadow Valley has no water main supply to serve properties in the area, other than domestic, and there is minimal water supply that can serve properties along Casa Buena Drive. An insufficient water supply will increase the risk of a fire not being able to be controlled and increasing in degree and in the number of properties being affected after it has begun; 
(b)  The extent of isolation experienced by town residents in the event that a fire or other catastrophe beginning a fire causes the bridge and/or freeway overpass to collapse; 
(c)  The extent of roadway damage and/or amount of debris blocking the roadways of the town in the event of a fire; 
(d)  Climatic conditions (hot, dry weather with high winds) which increase the risk and spread of fire; 
(e)  Time of day will influence the amount of traffic on roadways which would present an obstacle to timely respond to a fire and could intensify the risk to life during normal business hours when traffic is busiest. The town of Corte Madera covers approximately four square miles including a population estimated at nine thousand one hundred. Many town residents commute to work in other cities which increases the traffic within the town. There are two fire stations and a total of twenty career and twenty volunteer fire department personnel. The fire department handles diverse responsibilities including wildland, urban, freeway, and paramedical. 
(f)  The availability of timely mutual aid or military assistance is an important factor in the ability to respond to fires. The town depends heavily on mutual aid resources for even a single-dwelling structure fire. In a widespread disaster, those resources would be unavailable. 
(g)  The close proximity of residences and large portion of dwellings with wood shingle roof coverings within wildland-urban interface fire areas could result in conflagrations that spread rapidly from residence to residence. 
(5)  Conclusion. Local climatic, geologic and topographic conditions impact fire prevention efforts, and the frequency, spread, acceleration, intensity and size of fire involving buildings in this community. Further, they impact potential damage to all structures from earthquake and subsequent fire. Therefore it is found to be reasonably necessary that the 2006 Edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code be adopted as amended herein to mitigate the effects of the above conditions. 
(Ord. 905 § 1 (part), 2008) 
15.04.090 - Appeals. 
    Whenever the fire chief disapproves an application or refuses to grant a permit applied for, or when it is claimed that the provisions of the code do not apply or that the true intent and meaning of the code have been misconstrued or wrongly interpreted, the applicant may appeal from the decision of the chief to the town council in writing, within thirty days from the date of the decision appealed. The town council shall render decisions and findings in writing to the fire chief, with a duplicate copy to the appellant. 
(Ord. 905 § 1 (part), 2008) 
15.04.100 - Penalties. 
    Any person who violates any of the provisions of the Wildland-Urban Interface Code as adopted and amended herein or fails to comply therewith, or who violates or fails to comply with any order made thereunder, or who violates any provisions of this chapter, or who builds in violation of any specifications or plans submitted and approved thereunder, or any certificate or permit issued thereunder, and from which no appeal has been taken, or who fails to comply with such an order as affirmed or modified by the Corte Madera fire department, or by a court of competent jurisdiction, within the required time, shall severally for each and every such violation and noncompliance, respectively be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one hundred eighty days or by both such fine and imprisonment. The imposition of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a reasonable time; and when not otherwise specified, each ten days that prohibited conditions are maintained shall constitute a separate offense. 
    The application of the above penalty shall not be held to prevent the enforced removal of prohibited conditions, buildings, or structures.

Temporary erosion control measures must be installed prior to the start of any other work and maintained throughout the rainy season. Where the approved schedule of work calls for installation of permanent erosion control measures prior to October 15th, the installation of temporary measures may be waived by the director. If in the opinion of the director, permanent erosion control measures will not be in place by October 15th, a temporary erosion control plan shall be required by September 1st, and the installation of temporary erosion control measures shall be required by October 15th. 
(i)  Inspection. Erosion control measures required prior to the start of other work shall be inspected and approved by the director prior to the start of the other work. The director shall also inspect the work prior to September 1st and prior to October 15th to confirm that required erosion control measures will be or are in place by October 15th. Additional inspections will be made as necessary during the rainy season to assure erosion control measures are in place and working. 
(j)  Modifications. The director may require modifications of previously approved erosion control plans and methods to accommodate unanticipated conditions on the site. The director shall notify permittee in writing of the requirements and specify a reasonable period of time within which permittee must comply. Permittee shall comply with such requests within the specified time. 
(k)  Suspension. If permittee fails to meet any requirement of this ordinance or administrative regulations, the director may suspend the erosion control and the grading permits and permittee shall cease all work on the site in accordance with Section 15.70. The director shall reinstate suspended permits upon permittee's correction of the cause of suspension. If work does not cease upon suspension of the permits, the permits shall be revoked by the director. A permittee may appeal a determination suspending or revoking a permit upon appeal being made in accordance with the permit appeal procedures set forth by this chapter. (Ord. 719 § 4, 1984) 
(Ord. No. 916, § 6, 10-6-2009; Ord. No. 951, § 2, 7-21-2015) 
15.20.290 - Lateral support. 
    No grading shall be so performed as to deprive adjacent land of lateral support or to cause the slippage or excessive washing of earth or rock onto adjacent public or private land. 
(Ord. 402 § 6(E), 1963) 
15.20.300 - Structures. 
    Retaining walls, crib walls, culverts, drainage facilities or other structures may be required by the director to be shown on the grading plan. (Ord. 402 § 6(F), 1963) 
(Ord. No. 916, § 7, 10-6-2009) 
15.20.310 - Filling of land below elevation 7, mean sea level datum. 
    Where fill is to be placed on land which is below elevation 7, the grading plan shall define whether the applicant proposes a low-level development or a high-level development and the following requirements shall be met, in addition to the other provisions of this chapter: 
(1)  Low-level developments shall be completely enclosed from tidewater by levees of approved design having a minimum top elevation of +9.00 feet. Within each project, a holding pond or interconnected ponds shall be provided. The combined area of such ponds shall be not less than one-twentieth of the total area drained, including any tributary outside area. The bottom elevation of the ponds shall be not higher than -3.00 feet and the area shall be measured at elevation 0.00. 
    The culvert or culverts draining the holding ponds shall be equipped with tide gates at the discharge ends and shall have a minimum combined cross-sectional area in square feet equal to eight one-hundredths times the total number of acres drained, including outside tributary area. The above culvert area is based upon a coefficient of discharge, C of not less than 0.60 in the formula: 
Q = CA v2gh Where Q = discharge in cubic feet per second A = cross-sectional area of culvert in 
   square feet 2g = 64.4 feet per second per second h = head in feet  
    For lower values of C, the culvert area shall be correspondingly increased. The invert elevations of the culverts shall be not higher than-3.00 feet, and the tops of the culverts shall be not higher than 0.00 elevation. The channel extending from the discharge ends of the culverts to the open bay shall be so designed and constructed that the hydraulic drop in the channel will not exceed 0.60 feet, with the water surface at the culvert at elevation 0.00, and the flow in the channel in cubic feet per second equal to one-half of the total number of acres drained. The acres drained shall include the area tributary to the channel. Should the hydraulic drop in the channel exceed 0.60 feet, all elevations within the low-level project shall be correspondingly increased. The minimum ground elevation of areas intended not to flood shall be elevation +3.00 feet plus an additional elevation representing allowance for subsidence based on a fifty-year period. Subsidence shall be computed based on the proposed depth of new fill and for the different parts of the project according to the method set forth in "Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics," by Donald W. Taylor, 1948, Chapters 10 and 12 or similar method approved by the town engineer. In no case shall the subsidence assumed for design purposes be less than seventy-five percent of the computed ultimate settlement; 
(2)  High-level development. The minimum ground elevation of areas intended not to flood shall be +7.00 feet plus allowance for subsidence based on a fifty-year period. Subsidence shall be calculated as for the low-level development set forth above; 
(3)  Normal drainage. The street grades and storm system shall be designed for the maximum storm flow against a tide level in the bay of +3.76 feet, and further, the system shall also be designed to function with one-half the maximum storm flow against a tide level in the bay of +5.33 feet. Future subsidence of the streets and drains must be allowed for so that gravity drainage will be adequate after fifty years of normal subsidence. The permittee shall provide the town with such computations, or the written opinion of a soils engineer, upon each of these matters; 
(4)  Drainage pumps. In lieu of the holding ponds, pumps may be provided to handle surface water runoff during the time the discharge end of drain lines is below water. The pumps and appurtenances shall be dedicated to the town or an arrangement for maintenance satisfactory to the town council shall be set forth in an agreement with the town. Said pumps shall meet the following requirements: 
(A)  Capacity shall be adequate to handle maximum runoff, including any tributary areas, for a fifty-year storm, 
(B)  Discharge from pump shall be to a tidal channel and, if below water, shall be provided with necessary check valves. 
(C)  Pumps shall operate automatically when a set water elevation is exceeded. 
    All design and construction of drainage facilities hereafter implemented within the town shall comply and be in conformance with that certain publication known as "Town-Wide Storm Drainage and Flood Control Study, Phase 1" prepared by AN West Inc. dated May 2007, and "Town-Wide Storm Drainage and Flood Control Study, Phase 2" prepared by AN West Inc. dated December 2008, and their appendices. This shall include, but not be limited to, rainfall criteria, runoff, facility sizing, and all other engineering criteria included in these documents.

15.20.320 - Debris fills. 
(a)  Safety: 
(1)  The permittee shall not allow any fires or burning on the site. Any fires that occur shall be fought continuously night and day by at least two men with a bulldozer until extinguished, all under the direction of and at the expense of the permittee; 
(2)  No smoking shall be permitted on the site and applicable signs shall be conspicuously posted; 
(3)  A town standard six inch fire hydrant shall be provided on site with connections and location approved by the fire chief; 
(4)  At least one bulldozer in operating condition shall be stationed on site at all times. 
(b)  Placement: 
(1)  All debris shall be compacted with a bulldozer so that no visible voids are created; 
(2)  At least one foot of earth fill shall be placed each day over the day's accumulation of debris; 
(3)  Face of debris shall be covered with at least one foot of earth every Saturday at five p.m. The permittee shall maintain a bulldozer working at the site continuously after said time until all debris has been so covered; 
(4)  Debris shall be placed in a cellular pattern of seventy-five feet times one hundred feet, each cell separated by earth fill four feet thick extending down to original ground of site; 
(5)  Ratio of debris to earth fill shall be a maximum of three to one; 
(6)  A minimum of three feet of earth fill shall be placed over debris within one year from placement of the debris. 
(Ord. 402 § 6(H), 1963) 
15.20.330 - Variances and alternates. 
    At the time of the initial filing of an application or at any time during progress of the work, the applicant may propose variances from or alternates to any of the requirements and standards set forth in this chapter or stated in any previous permit. Such variances and alternates shall then be reviewed by the director or town council, authorizing agent for said permit, and the variance or alternate may be authorized upon a finding that the general public and adjacent property owners will be equally protected thereby. However, no person shall be entitled to any such variance or alternate as a matter of right, and approval thereof shall be strictly discretionary with the reviewing authority. In the absence of written approval of such variance or alternate, the requirements and standards set forth in this chapter shall be strictly adhered to. 
    All design and construction of drainage facilities hereafter implemented within the town shall comply and be in conformance with that certain publication known as, "Town-Wide Storm Drainage and Flood Control Study, Phase 1" prepared by AN West Inc. dated May 2007, and "Town-Wide Storm Drainage and Flood Control Study, Phase 2" prepared by AN West Inc. dated December 2008 and its appendices.

Chapter 15.21 - DAMAGE DEPOSITS 
Sections: 

15.21.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to impose a requirement for the posting of a damage deposit as a condition to the issuance of certain construction permits when the director of public works or his or her designee determines that the construction work to be performed in reliance on the permit represents a risk of damage to town property including but not limited to town streets, sidewalks, underground pipes and infrastructure, rights-of-way, watercourses, open space, and/or parks. Damage deposits required by this chapter shall be pledged to the town for security purposes in the event of damage to town property in connection with construction work performed in reliance on a construction permit. Damage deposits shall be refunded or charged in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Damage deposits may be established and modified from time to time as part of the town's fees resolution proceedings but shall be maintained and processed as refundable deposits, rather than fees for services provided by the town. 
(Ord. No. 914, § 1, 10-20-2009) 
15.21.020 - Determination of deposit. 
(a)  No application for a permit to perform any construction work that requires review by the director of public works or his or her designee (subject to the following exception) shall be approved, and no permit shall be issued until the director of public works or his or her designee has first determined whether a damage deposit shall be required in accordance with this chapter as a condition to the issuance of the permit. If the director of public works or his or her designee determines that a damage deposit shall be required, the permit shall not be issued until the permit applicant has first deposited a damage deposit in accordance with this chapter. Deposits for encroachment permits required by Chapter 12.12 of this Code shall not be subject to the provisions of this Chapter except as specified by subsection (d). 
(b)  In determining whether the work to be performed in reliance on the permit represents a risk of damage to town property, the director of public works or his or her designee shall consider: (1) the construction work contemplated by the applicant including its scope and the size of the project; (2) its location; (3) the nature of the contemplated construction and the type of construction procedures likely to be utilized by the applicant; (4) the type of equipment the applicant will, or is likely to, use in connection with the contemplated construction; and (5) such other factors as the director of public works or his or her designee deems relevant. 
(c)  Damage deposits shall be set by the town council in amounts that are deemed to constitute reasonable estimates of the costs of the town in repairing the damage arising out of the permitted work. damage deposit amounts may be established and modified from time to time by the town's fees resolution. 
(d)  If the director of public works or his or her designee determines that a damage deposit shall be required, the Director or his or her designee shall provide the permit applicant with the reasons for that determination upon the request of the applicant. The director of public works or his or her designee shall set the deposit amount in accordance with the applicable amount specified in the town's most recent fee resolution or as otherwise established by resolution of the town council. This damage deposit shall be in addition to any other fees and deposits that may be required in connection with the work that is being permitted. Whenever the director of public works or his or her designee determines that more than one permit to be issued to the applicant requires a damage deposit under this chapter, the director of public works or his or her designee may in his or her discretion waive any one or more damage deposits or combine any two or more damage deposits under this chapter into a combined deposit amount. The director of public works or his or her designee may in his or her discretion combine any damage deposit amount(s) under this chapter and the encroachment permit deposit amount under Chapter 12.12 into a combined deposit amount. Whenever any deposit amounts have been combined under this section, the provisions of this chapter shall be applied to the combined deposit amount. 
(e)  An applicant who is dissatisfied with the decision of the director of public works or his or her designee may, within fourteen days after the mailing of the decision by the director of public works or his or her designee, file an appeal with the town council by written notice to the town clerk stating with particularity the applicant's objections to the decision by the director of public works or his or her designee. The appeal shall be accompanied by the payment of the appeal fee required by the town's most recent fee resolution. After an appeal in compliance with the provisions of this section is received, the town clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the town council on the appeal. Any evidence relevant to the factors described in Section 15.21.020(b) may be considered by the town council. Evidence to be presented at the appeal hearing shall not be subject to the formal rules of evidence. The town council shall make a de novo review of the evidence presented at the hearing and affirm, modify, or reverse the determination of the director of public works or his or her designee under the standards set forth by this section. The decision of the town council shall be final. 
(f)  For the purposes of this section a "risk of damage to town property" shall mean a set of facts or circumstances that reasonably leads to the conclusion that the performance of the activities being proposed presents a significant risk of damage to the roadways, curbs, gutters, streets, sidewalks, parkways, sewer lines, waterways, or other infrastructure, rights-of-way, or unimproved property of the Town or Sanitary District No. 2 of Marin County which would require the expenditure of funds to repair, remove, and/or replace the damage. 
(Ord. No. 914, § 1, 10-20-2009) 
15.21.030 - Deposit and utilization of the damage deposit.

If the deposit is retained in a separate bank account, the applicant shall be entitled to interest accruing on the deposit at the interest rate applied by the bank. If the applicant deposits the amount with the town directly, then the applicant shall be required to execute an agreement on a form provided by the town acknowledging the waiver of any right to interest which would otherwise accrue on the amount deposited with the town. 
(b)  The damage deposit, and all applicable interest, shall only be released to the applicant upon the satisfactory completion of all work authorized by all permits associated with the applicant's project (including but not necessarily limited to building, public works, fire, and land use entitlements and permits), the fulfillment of all conditions of each permit associated with the applicant's project, and upon the determination by the director of public works or his or her designee that no damage has been done to town property, or if such damage did result in connection with the construction project, that such damage has been repaired by the applicant to the satisfaction of the director of public works or his or her designee. 
(c)  In the event the applicant damages town property in connection with the permitted work and fails or refuses to repair such damage to the satisfaction of the director of public works or his or her designee, the town may utilize the damage deposit to make such repairs and pay for the costs incurred by the town. 
(d)  Prior to utilizing the damage deposit for repairs to town property, the director of public works or his or her designee shall provide the applicant with his or her decision. The decision shall notify the applicant of the town's intention to utilize the damage deposit for repairs to town property. The notice shall include a description of the damage to the town property and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the town property. Whenever more than one deposit have been combined under Section 15.21.020(d), the decision need not specify the individual permit deposit that is being charged. 
(e)  An applicant who is dissatisfied with the decision of the director of public works or his or her designee may, within fourteen days after the mailing of the decision by the director of public works or his or her designee, file an appeal with the town council by written notice to the town clerk stating with particularity the applicant's objections to the decision by the director of public works or his or her designee. The appeal shall be accompanied by the payment of the appeal fee required by the town's most recent fee resolution. After an appeal in compliance with the provisions of this section is received, the town clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the town council on the appeal. Any evidence relevant to the occurrence of the damage or the cost of repair or replacement of the damage may be considered by the town council. Evidence to be presented at the appeal hearing shall not be subject to the formal rules of evidence. The town council shall make a de novo review of the evidence presented at the hearing and affirm, modify, or reverse the director of public works or his or her designee's determination. The decision of the town council shall be final. If the decision is modified or reversed, the town shall refund to the permittee that portion of the deposit that is determined by the town council to be owed to the permittee.

Chapter 15.50 - TREES 
Sections: 
I. - General Provisions 

15.50.010 - Purposes and principles. 
(a)  Trees and views contribute to the attractiveness and quality of life in the town. 
(b)  Trees produce a wide variety of benefits. Trees modify temperatures and winds, replenish oxygen to the atmosphere and maintain soil moisture, control soil erosion, and provide wildlife habitat. Trees contribute to the visual environment of the town by providing scale, color, silhouette and mass, and by creating visual screens and buffers to separate land uses, and promote privacy. Trees may enhance property values, stabilize slopes, reduce the need for surface drainage systems, and can conserve energy. Trees also function as living landmarks of the town's history and provide a welcome element of nature in the midst of settlement. 
(c)  Views, whether of San Francisco Bay, Mount Tamalpais, the surrounding hills, or other natural and man-made landmarks, also produce a variety of significant and tangible benefits for both residents and visitors to the town. Views contribute to the visual environment of the town by providing inspiring panoramic vistas, and by acting as distinctive supplements to architectural design. Similarly, sunlight contributes to people's health and well-being, enhances property values and provides solar energy and other economic benefits. 
(d)  Owners and residents should maintain trees on their property in accordance with Section 12.40.030, in a healthy condition for both safety reasons and for preservation of sunlight and outward views. Before planting trees, owners and residents should consider view and sunlight blockage potential, and avoid planting trees defined in this chapter as "undesirable." 
(e)  Trees, views, privacy, sunlight, and the benefits derived from each may come into conflict. The continued growth of trees, and their planting locations and species selected, may produce intended beneficial effects and unintended deleterious effects both on the property on which they are planted and on neighboring properties. The public health, welfare and safety are served by establishing standards which will protect and preserve trees while creating a procedure to resolve view and sunlight obstruction claims, so as to provide a reasonable balance between tree, view, privacy and sunlight-related values. 
(f)  Whenever possible, tree work shall adhere to the standards set forth in the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) Standards for Pruning and the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) Standard A300. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the meaning and construction of words and phrases hereinafter set forth shall apply: 
(1)  "Active use area" means the most frequently actively used portion or portions of a residential building or site, or nonresidential building, from which views and/or sunlight are available. 
(2)  "Alter" means to take action that could foreseeably endanger the health of a tree, including but not limited to, pruning of more than thirty-three percent of the canopy area, cutting, girdling, interfering with the water supply, applying chemicals, or regrading around the feeder root zone of the tree. 
(3)  "Arbitration" means a legal procedure as set forth in California Civil Procedure Code Section 1280, et seq. 
(4)  "Arbitrator" means a neutral party who will conduct a process similar to a trial, and who will hear testimony, consider evidence, and make a binding decision for the disputing parties. 
(5)  "Arborist" means anyone who possesses the technical competence through experience and related training to provide for or supervise the management of trees and other woody plants.

II. - Tree Permit 

15.50.040 - Application for permit. 
(a)  Permit Required. Any person desiring to remove, destroy or alter one or more trees on his or her property in the town, except those exempted from permit requirements in Section 15.50.050, shall apply in writing to the planning director for a permit to do so ("tree permit"). 
(b)  Application. The application for a tree permit shall contain the precise number, species, size and location of the tree or trees to be removed, destroyed or altered, a detailed description of the work proposed, and a brief statement of the reason for removal or alteration, as well as any other pertinent information the planning director may require. 
(c)  Fee. No fee is required for a tree permit application. The fee for an appeal of a tree permit decision shall be one hundred dollars. 
(d)  Town Trees Require Tree Permit. If the town desires to remove, alter or destroy any tree located on property in which the town has a fee, easement or any other interest, it may do so only after applying for and securing a tree permit; provided, however, that no such tree permit is required for the town's maintenance pruning of such trees and no such tree permit is required to remove a tree in emergency situations pursuant to Section 15.50.050(7). 
(Ord. 840 § 1, 1999; Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.050 - Exemptions to permit requirements. 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this chapter, the following activities may be performed without first securing a tree permit: 
(1)  Trees Below Permit Size. On private property, the removal, destruction or alteration of trees with a single trunk circumference less than fifty inches (or multistemmed trees having an aggregate circumference of less than one hundred twenty inches), measured four and one-half feet above grade; 
(2)  Maintenance Pruning. Maintenance pruning, as defined in Section 15.50.020, of a tree by the tree owner; 
(3)  Topping of Special Tree(s). Topping of trees specifically planted and maintained as a hedge, espalier, bonsai or in pollard form; 
(4)  Trees in the Public Right-of-way. Trees in the public right-of-way do not require a tree permit for maintenance pruning by the town or the owner of the property (i) immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way or (ii) on which the public right-of-way is located; 
(5)  Undesirable Species. Undesirable species of any size may be altered, removed or destroyed without a tree permit. However, inspection of the tree and its confirmation as being an undesirable species by the town arborist are required prior to the removal, destruction or alteration of any undesirable species with a trunk circumference of fifty inches or more (or multistemmed tree having an aggregate circumference of one hundred twenty inches or more), measured four and one-half feet above grade. This procedure is for species identification only and does not require a permit; 
(6)  Public Utilities. Public utility companies subject to the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission may perform such pruning as is necessary to comply with the safety regulations of said commission and to maintain a safe operation of their facilities without a permit. However, they should notify the planning department at least three working days (except in emergencies) prior to taking any action. The planning director shall cause such pruning work to be inspected, when appropriate, to ensure that good pruning practices previously referenced are followed. The planning director shall have the authority to stop any tree pruning performed by a utility company if such practices are not being followed; 
(7)  Emergencies. In case of emergency, a tree located on private property or on property in which the town has a fee, easement or any other interest, may be removed without the necessity of a permit application as required by this chapter upon a determination by the town manager, or his/her designee, that removal of the tree is necessary for the immediate protection of life or property; 
(8)  View and Sunlight Claim. Any removal or alteration of a tree permitted or required under any order, award or agreement issued or entered into, respectively, pursuant to Article III of this chapter by which the right to a view and/or sunlight is established. 
(Ord. 840 §§ 2, 3, 1999; Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.060 - Factors for decision on permit. 
    The determination of the planning director in granting or denying a tree permit application shall be based upon the following factors: 
(1)  The condition of the tree with respect to disease, general health, root or other damage, public nuisance, fire hazard, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interferences with utility service, and whether or not the tree acts as a host for a plant which is parasitic to another species of tree which is in danger of being exterminated by the parasite; 
(2)  The number of existing trees in the area, the number of healthy trees that a given parcel of land will support, and the current effects of the tree(s) and their removal on neighboring vegetation; 
(3)  The extent to which the tree(s) provide: 
(A)  Privacy, 
(B)  Energy conservation and/or climate control, 
(C)  Soil stability, as measured by soil structure, degree of slope and extent of tree root system(s); 
(4)  Other tree-related factors, including but not limited to, species, size, growth maintenance requirements, aesthetic form, vigor, location, screening, potential for replacement of removed trees, historic value, and the effect of tree removal or alteration upon the public health, safety, prosperity, beauty and general welfare of the area; 
(5)  Preservation/restoration of views and/or sunlight on an applicant's property. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.070 - Permit processing. 
(a)  Review of Application. The planning director may refer the application to another department, committee or person for report and recommendation. Where appropriate, the planning director may also consider a written report from an independent tree expert at the applicant's expense, if agreed to by the applicant. 
    In granting a permit, the planning director may attach reasonable conditions to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. When a permit is denied, the planning director shall state the reasons for said denial based on the factors specified in Section 15.50.060. 
(b)  Notice and Time Frame. When the planning director receives an application for a tree permit, notice of said application shall be mailed to the owners of all properties within three hundred feet of the property on which the tree(s) is (are) located, at least ten days prior to a decision by the planning director. 
(c)  Decision. The planning director may approve, conditionally approve or deny the application, and notice of the planning director's decision shall be mailed to the applicant and any other person requesting such notification. 
(d)  Appeal. Any interested party may appeal the planning director's decision. Such appeal must be submitted in writing to the planning department, with appeal fee, within ten days from the date of the planning director's decision, briefly stating the facts and grounds of the appeal. The planning director shall set the matter on the next available town council agenda and shall notify the appellant, applicant and all property owners within three hundred feet of the site in writing of such meeting. After a public hearing, the council may affirm, modify or reverse the planning director's decision. 
    If no appeal is received by the town, the permit shall become effective ten days after the date of the planning director's decision. It shall be the responsibility of the person actually removing or altering any tree under this chapter to have on his or her person the permit or a copy of the permit at the time of such removal or alteration. 
(e)  Lapse of Approval. A permit for removal or alteration of a tree shall lapse and become null and void one year following the date on which the approval became effective, unless, prior to the expiration of one year, work is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the site which was the subject of the application. 
    A tree permit may be renewed for an additional period of one year beyond its initial expiration date; provided that, prior to the expiration of the date when the original permit expires, an application for renewal of the tree permit is filed with the planning department. A renewal application involving any requested change to the tree work originally granted in the permit shall be treated as a new application, subject to all the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.080 - Applicability with Title 18. 
(a)  Zoning Decisions. Except for the first ten years after the zoning approval, the rights granted by this chapter may be asserted and established against any trees which are required to be maintained and/or planted pursuant to any approval granted pursuant to Title 18 of this code. 
(b)  Protection During Construction. When proposed developments may impact any tree, special construction techniques to protect the tree and roots may be required, as determined by the planning director, such as: 
(1)  The existing ground surface within the drip line of any tree shall not be cut, filled or compacted unless otherwise approved by the planning director. Welded wire fencing and hay bales may be required around the drip line. Tree wells may be used when approved by the planning director. 
(2)  Excavation adjacent to any tree, when permitted, shall be in such a manner that will minimize root damage. Inspection shall be required prior to backfilling. Pruning may be required by the town to compensate for root damage and/or removal, at the expense of the applicant or owner. 
(3)  No oil, gas, chemicals, heavy construction machinery, parking of vehicles, or other construction materials shall be stored or allowed to stand within the feeder root zone of trees protected by this chapter. Solvents, oils, or other liquid or solid waste shall not be, or be allowed to be, dumped within the feeder root zone. 
(4)  No signs, or wires, except those needed for support of the tree, shall be attached to any trees. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
III. - View and Sunlight Preservation 

15.50.090 - Specific purposes. 
    The purposes of this article, based on the purposes and principles listed in Section 15.50.010, are to: 
(1)  Recognize and establish the right of persons to preserve views, sunlight, trees or privacy on their property; 
(2)  Recognize and establish parity in the right of persons to preserve views, sunlight, trees or privacy on their property; 
(3)  Establish a process by which persons may seek restoration of such views or sunlight when unreasonably obstructed by the growth of trees. 
(Ord. 797 § 2 (part), 1995: Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.100 - Right to view and sunlight. 
    Subject to the other provisions of this article, it is recognized that every person owning real property in the town has the right to have a reasonable amount of the view and sunlight benefitting his/her real property which existed at any time during the period beginning on the date that the complainant purchased the property and ending twelve months immediately following thereafter. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the above, no right to a view or sunlight may be established under this article as to any tree located in the public right-of-way; provided, however, that such rights may be established in accordance with this article as to trees located on property in which the town enjoys a fee interest, easement or any other interest, excluding trees located in the public right-of-way. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the above, no right to a view or sunlight may be established under this article as to any heritage tree, and heritage trees may not be altered, destroyed or removed on the basis of any provision of this article. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the above, a view or sunlight right may only be established based on the later of: (A) facts or conditions which occurred or existed no more than twenty years prior to the date the complainant first notifies the tree owner under Section 15.50.110(1); or (B) facts or conditions which occurred or existed during the one-year period specified in the first paragraph of this section. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the above, no view or sunlight right may be based upon and no view or sunlight right may be exercised with respect to any tree located more than three hundred feet from any boundary of complainant's real property. 
(Ord. 797 § 2 (part), 1995: Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.110 - Process for resolution of claims. 
    To establish view and sunlight rights recognized and established herein, the complainant must follow the process established by this article. First, the complainant must complete the "initial discussion" process described below. Second, if that process does not yield a result mutually satisfactory to the complainant and the tree owner, then the complainant must seek to mediate his/her view/sunlight claim in accordance with this article. If the tree owner refuses to mediate or if the mediation is unsuccessful in resolving their differences, then the complainant must attempt to initiate arbitration as set forth hereinafter. If arbitration is not accepted by the tree owner, and the initial discussion and mediation have proved unsuccessful in resolving the view/sunlight claim, the complainant may then initiate litigation to determine his/her view/sunlight claim rights. Except for view claims brought under the second part of Section 15.50.100(1), no town action or decisions are required to establish or exercise a complainant's view and/or sunlight rights. 
(1)  Initial Discussion. A complainant who believes that tree growth on another person's property has caused unreasonable obstruction of views or sunlight from the complainant's active use area shall first notify the tree owner of such concerns. 
    The notification should, if possible, consist of personal discussion to enable the complainant and tree owner to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
(2)  If Parties Agree. Following the initial discussion, if agreement is reached between the parties as to the existence and nature of complainant's rights and on what restoration action is to be taken on the tree(s) in question, that agreement shall be reduced to writing and executed by all parties concerned. Said agreement must set forth all of the matters described in Section 15.50.150; otherwise, it shall not be enforceable and grant no view or sunlight rights hereunder. 
(3)  If Parties Do Not Agree. If the parties do not agree as to the rights in question and what action should be taken regarding the tree(s) in question, the complainant must prepare and provide to the tree owner a view/sunlight claim (and provide a copy of the view/sunlight claim to the town). 
(Ord. 797 § 2 (part), 1995: Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.120 - View/sunlight claim. 
    A view/sunlight claim shall consist of all of the following: 
(1)  For the relevant period, a description of the nature and extent of the alleged obstruction, including pertinent and corroborating evidence. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, photographic prints, negatives or slides, and written testimony from residents living in the area. Such evidence must show absence of the obstruction at or during the relevant period of time. Evidence to show the date of property acquisition or occupancy by the complainant must be included; 
(2)  The exact location of all trees alleged to cause the obstruction, the address of the property upon which the tree(s) are located, and the present tree owner's name and address; 
(3)  Evidence of the failure of initial discussion as described in Section 15.50.110(1) to resolve the dispute. The complainant must provide evidence that written attempts at reconciliation under Section 15.50.110(1) have been made and have failed. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of and receipts for certified or registered mail correspondence; 
(4)  Specific view or sunlight restoration actions proposed by the complainant to resolve the unreasonable obstruction. 
(Ord. 797 § 2 (part), 1995; Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.130 - View/sunlight claim process. 
(a)  Mediation. If the initial discussion fails to achieve agreement between the tree owner and complainant, the complainant shall prepare and deliver to the tree owner a written view/sunlight claim and propose mediation as a timely means to settle the obstruction dispute. 
    Acceptance of mediation by the tree owner shall be voluntary, but the tree owner shall have no more than thirty days from service of notice either to accept or to reject the offer of mediation. If mediation is accepted, the parties shall mutually agree upon a mediator within thirty days, and should commence mediation within sixty days. 
    The mediator shall consider and be governed by the purposes and provisions set forth in this chapter in attempting to help resolve the dispute. The mediator shall not have the power to issue binding orders for view restoration action, but shall strive to enable the parties to resolve their dispute by written agreement in order to eliminate the need for arbitration or litigation. Any agreement reached as a result of the mediation process described in this section must be reduced to writing and executed by all parties concerned. Said agreement must set forth all of the matters described in Section 15.50.150; otherwise, it shall not be enforceable and grant no view or sunlight rights hereunder. 
(b)  Arbitration. In those cases where the initial discussion process fails and where mediation is declined by the tree owner or has failed, the complainant shall offer in writing to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. 
    The tree owner shall have thirty days from service of notice to accept or reject arbitration. If accepted, the parties shall agree on a specific arbitrator within thirty days, and shall indicate such agreement in writing. If the parties do not agree on a specific arbitrator within thirty days, either party may petition the court to appoint an arbitrator. 
    The arbitrator shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter in deciding the view/sunlight claim and shall submit a complete written decision to the complainant and the tree owner. This decision shall decide all of the matters described in Section 15.50.150, and if the complainant prevails, shall include a pertinent list of all required view or sunlight restoration actions with any appropriate conditions concerning such actions, and a schedule by which the actions must be completed; otherwise, it shall not be enforceable and grant no view or sunlight rights hereunder. A copy of the arbitrator's decision shall be submitted by the complainant to the town planning director immediately after it is rendered. Any decision of the arbitrator shall be enforceable pursuant to the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure § 1285, et seq. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.140 - Litigation. 
    If a complainant has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain agreement under Sections 15.50.110 and 15.50.130(a) and the tree owner has declined binding arbitration under Section 15.50.130(b), the complainant has the right to initiate civil action for resolution of his/her view/sunlight claim and the view or sunlight obstruction dispute under the provisions of this article. 
    The litigating complainant shall file a copy of the lawsuit with the town planning director. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.150 - Specificity required to enjoy view/sunlight rights. 
    Any person (the "complainant") desiring to remove, destroy or alter one or more trees on property owned or controlled by another person (the "tree owner") may do so only if the complainant: 
(1)  Establishes a right to do so under Section 15.50.100; 
(2)  Establishes said right and the nature thereof in accordance with the procedures specified in Sections 15.50.110 through 15.50.140; and 
(3)  Either enters into an agreement with the tree owner or obtains an arbitration or judicial decision: 
(A)  Establishing said right, 
(B)  Specifying, in detail, the nature of said right, and 
(C)  Specifying the nature and timing of the restoration action and the parties responsible for performing said action required to effectuate the said rights so established. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.160 - Standards for evaluation of claims. 
    In determining the extent to which the complainant may exercise his/her view and/or sunlight rights otherwise established hereunder, the following factors shall be considered: 
(1)  The vantage point(s) from which the view is obtained; 
(2)  The extent of the alleged view or sunlight obstruction; 
(3)  The quality of the views which existed at or during the relevant time including existence of landmarks or other unique view features, and/or the extent to which the tree(s) blocks their view; 
(4)  The extent to which the view or sunlight is diminished by factors other than the tree(s) involved in the claim; 
(5)  The extent to which the tree(s) have grown to obscure the enjoyment of sunlight in the active use area of the complainant's property; 
(6)  The condition of the tree with respect to disease, general health, root or other damage, public nuisance, fire hazard, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interferences with utility service, and whether or not the tree acts as a host for a plant which is parasitic to another species of tree which is in danger of being exterminated by the parasite; 
(7)  The number of existing trees in the area, the number of healthy trees that a given parcel of land will support, and the current effects of the tree(s) and their removal on neighboring vegetation; 
(8)  The extent to which the tree(s) provide: 
(A)  Privacy, 
(B)  Energy conservation and/or climate control, 
(C)  Soil stability, as measured by soil structure, degree of slope and extent of tree(s) root system; 
(9)  Other tree-related factors, including but not limited to, species, size, growth maintenance requirements, aesthetic form, vigor, location, screening, potential for replacement of removed trees, historic value, and the effect of tree removal or alteration upon the public health, safety, prosperity, beauty and general welfare of the area. 
    The above factors shall not preclude reasonable restoration of view and/or sunlight. 
(Ord. 797 § 2 (part), 1995; Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.170 - Hierarchy of restoration actions. 
    View and/or sunlight restoration actions must be consistent with all other provisions of this chapter, except that no tree permit as provided in Article II of this chapter, need be obtained. It is recommended that all tree work authorized by Article III of this chapter be performed or supervised by a certified arborist. Restoration action shall be limited to the following, in order of preference: 
(1)  Vista Pruning. Restorative actions shall be limited to the vista pruning of branches where possible. 
(2)  Crown Reduction. When vista pruning of branches is not a feasible solution, crown reduction shall be preferable to tree removal if it is determined that the impact of crown reduction does not destroy the visual proportions of the tree, adversely affect the tree's growth pattern or health, or otherwise constitute a detriment to the tree(s) in question. 
(3)  Stand Thinning. The removal of a small percentage of the total number of trees from a grove of trees, without any replacement plantings. 
(4)  Topping. Eliminating the upper portion of a tree's trunk or main leader. 
(5)  Tree Removal, with Replacement Plantings. Tree removal, which may be considered when the above-mentioned restoration actions are judged to be ineffective and may be accompanied by replacement plantings of appropriate plant materials to restore the maximum level of benefits lost due to tree removal. Replacement plantings at an appropriate ratio can be required on the tree owner's or the complain-ant's property. Such trees shall be maintained so as not to cause a view obstruction. Under no circumstances shall restorative action include the replanting of undesirable species. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.180 - Responsibility for ongoing maintenance. 
    The complainant shall have the responsibility for paying for initial restoration actions. After this initial action, the cost of subsequent restoration actions shall be shared as determined by agreement between the tree owner and the complainant, or as ordered by arbitration decision or court order. 
    For "undesirable species" (see definition), initial restoration action shall be the responsibility of the complainant. Thereafter, however, the tree owner shall pay for the cost of restoration actions, other than removal, applied to undesirable species, unless otherwise agreed through mediation or ordered by arbitration decision or court order. 
(Ord. 797 § 3, 1995: Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.190 - Liability. 
(a)  The town shall not be liable for any damages, injury, costs or expenses which are the result of any decision made by the town or any other person (e.g., mediator, arbitrator or judge) concerning a view/sunlight claim or a complainant's assertions pertaining to views or sunlight rights granted or conferred in this chapter. 
(b)  Under no circumstances shall the town have any responsibility or liability to enforce or seek any legal redress, civil or criminal, for any decision it or any other person (except in a case where the town is a named party and is subject to a lawful order of a court of competent jurisdiction) makes concerning a view/sunlight claim. 
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
15.50.200 - Apportionment of costs. 
    Costs of the mediator or arbitrator shall be apportioned between the complainant and tree owner according to the following schedule: 
Mediation: First three hours: complainant, thereafter fifty-fifty or as determined by parties Arbitration: First three hours: complainant, thereafter fifty-fifty or as determined by arbitrator.  
(Ord. 796 § 2 (part), 1995) 
Chapter 15.60 - VACANT BUILDINGS 
Sections: 

15.60.010 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Code for Regulation of Vacant Buildings," may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as "this chapter." 
(Ord. 793 § 1 (part), 1995) 
15.60.020 - Findings and purpose. 
    The town council prefers that vacant buildings be kept in a well-maintained condition so as not to appear unoccupied. However, when a property owner fails to maintain properly an unoccupied building and when vacancy attracts vandalism and safety hazards, the town council desires to have a procedure to ensure that these undesirable conditions can be rectified. 
    The town council finds, determines and declares: that any building which remains vacant and unoccupied can become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an invitation to persons as a temporary abode and an increased fire hazard; that unkept and unsecured grounds surrounding such buildings encourage the dumping of garbage, trash, and other debris thereon; that such buildings create a blight in the town, depress market values of surrounding properties, thereby reducing tax revenues, create a need for additional governmental services, significantly interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties; such buildings further create an unhealthy and unsafe condition which affects the public, constituting an unreasonable use of property and a public nuisance as defined by this chapter. 
    Protection of the public health, safety and welfare requires the establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions may be prevented and abated.

The failure of any owner to submit any objections to the town clerk shall constitute a waiver of any such objections. 
(e)  At the time and place fixed for hearing and confirming the proposed assessments, the town council shall hear the same. At such hearing, only those persons who have submitted written objections to the town clerk will be heard by the town council. At said hearing, the town council may correct, modify or eliminate any proposed assessment which it may deem excessive or otherwise incorrect. Thereafter, by vote and resolution, the town council shall confirm each assessment and the amount thereof, as proposed or as corrected or modified, and order that an assessment be made a personal obligation of the owner or, alternatively, assess it against the property. If the town council orders that an assessment be charged as a personal obligation of the property owner, the town council shall direct appropriate town personnel to collect same by use of all appropriate legal remedies. If the town council orders that an assessment be made against the property, the town council shall also direct that the same be recorded on the property tax assessment roll and thereafter said assessment shall constitute a special assessment and lien against the property. The special assessment and lien shall be subject to the same penalties as are provided for other delinquent taxes or assessments of the town.

Title 16 - PROTECTION OF FLOOD HAZARD AREAS 
Chapters: 
Chapter 16.10 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 956, adopted June 21, 2016, amended Ch. 16.10 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 16.10, §§ 16.10.010-16.10.090, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. 889 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 845(b) § 1 (part), 1999. 
* Prior ordinance history: Ordinance 751. 

16.10.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of California has, in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800, conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the town council of the town of Corte Madera does ordain as follows in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 956, 6-21-2016) 
16.10.020 - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the town of Corte Madera are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 956, 6-21-2016) 
16.10.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as storm drains, flood-control pumps and dikes, water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for appropriate use and development of areas of special flood hazard; 
(7)  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  To insure that those who occupy areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 956, 6-21-2016) 
16.10.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for the following: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to flooding, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters to other areas or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 956, 6-21-2016) 
16.10.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
(a)  "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
(b)  "Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone- or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

(l)  "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
(m)  "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
(n)  "Flood, flooding or flood water" means: (1) a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and (2) the condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

(v)  "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control ordinances) and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
(w)  "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water or sanitary facilities, or structures and their contents. (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins 1, 3, and 7 for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing.) 
(x)  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."

(z)  "Fraud and victimization," as related to Section 16.10.090 "Variance procedure" of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the town council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
(aa)  "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

(cc)  "Hardship," as related to Section 16.10.090 "Variance procedure" of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result from the failure to grant the requested variance. The town council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
(dd)  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
(ee)  "Historic structure" means any structure that is:

(hh)  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
(1)  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
(A)  The wet floodproofing standards in Section 16.10.080(a)(3)(C) of this chapter; 
(B)  The anchoring standards in Section 16.10.080(a)(1) of this chapter; 
(C)  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 16.10.080(a)(2) of this chapter; 
(D)  The standards for utilities in Section 16.10.080(b) of this chapter. 
(2)  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
(jj)  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent. 
(kk)  "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
(ll)  "Mean sea level (MSL)" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.

(pp)  One Hundred-Year Flood or 100-Year Flood. See "Base flood." 
(qq)  "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 16.10.090 "Variance procedure" of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal or basin. 
(rr)  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

(xx)  "Start of construction" refers to substantial improvement and other proposed new development, and means the date the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a "substantial improvement," the actual "start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(yy)  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
(zz)  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(aaa)  "Substantial improvement" means any act or acts of reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other proposed new development of a structure occurring within the five years immediately preceding the current application, regardless of any change in ownership during this time period, which act or acts aggregated have a total cost that equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure"; provided, that the alteration does not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure"; or 
(3)  Any damage sustained by a structure as a result of an accidental fire limited to a single structure, provided that damage is not "substantial damage." 
(bbb)  "Ultimate settlement" means the total amount of settlement which is predicted, on the basis of a thorough soils investigation performed by an appropriately licensed professional, over the useful life of a structure. The minimum useful life of a structure shall be considered to be fifty years. 
(ccc)  "Variance" means a grant of relief from a requirement of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
(ddd)  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

16.10.060 - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards, and to all shoreline lands directly exposed to tidal action within the town. 
(b)  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the current version of the flood insurance study (FIS) for Marin County and Incorporated Areas revised August 15, 2017, and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs) revised August 15, 2017, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the town council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the Corte Madera Department of Public Works, 300 Tamalpais Ave, Corte Madera CA 94925. 
(c)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the town council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(d)  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing adopted codes, easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another adopted code, ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(e)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements; be liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and be deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(f)  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the town, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(g)  Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

(5)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(b)  Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The town engineer is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its provisions. 
(c)  Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Permit Review. Review all building, grading and development permits to determine the following: 
(A)  That the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, 
(B)  That all other required state and federal permits have been obtained, 
(C)  That the site is reasonably safe from flooding, 
(D)  That the proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot; 
(2)  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. 
(A)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 16.10.060(b) of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 16.10.080 of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the town council for adoption, or 
(B)  If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas-A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to administer Section 16.10.080 of this chapter: 
(i)  Simplified method: 
a.  One hundred-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method, and 
b.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA, or 
(ii)  Detailed method: The one hundred-year or base flood discharge and the base flood elevation shall be obtained using detailed methods identified in FEMA Publication 265, published in July 1995 and titled: "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas-A Flood Elevations"; 
(3)  Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
(A)  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation, 
(B)  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and 
(C)  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse is maintained; 
(4)  Documentation of Floodplain Development. The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following documents: 
(A)  The certification required in Section 16.10.080(a)(3)(A) (lowest floor elevations), 
(B)  The certification required in Section 16.10.080(a)(3)(B)(iii) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures), 
(C)  The certification required in Section 16.10.080(a)(3)(C)(i) or 16.10.080(a)(3)(C)(ii) (wet floodproofing standard), 
(D)  The certification of elevation required in Section 16.10.080(c)(2) (subdivision standards), 
(E)  The certification required in Section 16.10.080(e)(l) (floodway encroachments); 
(5)  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions or the exact boundaries of shoreline areas directly exposed to tidal action, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of a boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 16.10.090 of this chapter; 
(6)  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 16.10.060(c) of this chapter; 
(7)  Appeals. The town council of the town of Corte Madera shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(d)  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
(1)  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator or his/her designee, shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(2)  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
(e)  Changes in corporate boundaries: 
(1)  Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
(Ord. No. 956, 6-21-2016; Ord. No. 980 , § 1B, 12-18-2018)

(c)  Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
(1)  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(2)  All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of lowest floor of all proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevation, and lowest adjacent grade shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(5)  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(d)  Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
(1)  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within zones Aand AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, on sites located: 
(A)  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(B)  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(C)  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
(D)  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the elevation identified in subsection (a)(3) of this section, and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(2)  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A and AE on the flood insurance rate map, that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (d)(1) of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement and elevated so that either: 
(A)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
(B)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced pier or other foundation elements of at least equal strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade.

Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(e)  Standards for Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A and AE on the flood insurance rate map will either: 
(1)  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use-a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
(2)  Meet the permit requirement of Section 16.10.070 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (d) of this section. 
(f)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 16.10.060(b) of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
(2)  If subsection (e)(1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

16.10.090 - Variance procedure. 
(a)  Nature of Variances. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. It is the duty of the town council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements of this chapter shall be rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this section are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(b)  Appeal Board. 
(1)  In passing upon appeals and applications for variances, the town council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and: 
(A)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(B)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(C)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(D)  The importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(E)  The necessity of a waterfront location to the facility, where applicable; 
(F)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(G)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(H)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(I)  The safety of access for ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood; 
(J)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
(K)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(c)  Conditions for Variances. 
(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 16.10.070 and 16.10.080 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 16.10.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary," considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the town council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the town council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(A)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
(B)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Marin county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(6)  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(7)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(A)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(B)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 16.10.050 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
(C)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 16.10.050-see "Public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 16.10.050) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(8)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (c)(1) through (5) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(9)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (b)(1) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the town council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

16.10.100 - Coastal high hazard areas. 
(a)  Within coastal high hazard areas, Zones V, V1-30, and VE, as established under Section 16.10.060, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  All new residential and non-residential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level (i.e. base flood elevation - bfe). The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. 
(2)  All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Section 16.10.050 of this ordinance. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. 
(4)  Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings. 
(5)  Man-made alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited. 
(6)  The floodplain administrator, or his/her designee, shall obtain and maintain the following records: 
(A)  Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with Section 16.10.100; and 
(B)  The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement.

(1)  That the strict application of any standard prescribed by this title would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of this title; 
(2)  That there are exceptional circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use or development of the property in the city being subdivided or resubdivided; 
(3)  That the granting of the exception will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare nor injurious to the property or improvements in the immediate vicinity; 
(4)  That the granting of the exception will not be contrary to the objectives of this title. 
    Such findings shall state the reasons and grounds for making such exceptions. 
(c)  Additional requirements shall be imposed by the planning commission when it determines that such requirements are necessary to preserve the purpose and intent of this article and of the zoning title of this code, to conform to the character of improvements and lot design of the neighborhood within five hundred feet of the parcel split, and for the improvement of public and private streets, highways, ways, or easements as may be necessary for traffic, drainage and sanitary needs. The planning commission may require dedications or an offer of dedication by separate instruments for street opening or widening or easements and, if so required, such dedications shall be shown and recorded on the final parcel map.

Chapter 17.30 - DEDICATION OF LAND FOR PARKS 
Sections: 

17.30.010 - Dedication of land for park and recreational purposes. 
    The planning commission shall require, as a condition to the approval of a final subdivision map, the dedication or reservation of lands, payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park and recreational purposes. The recreation element, park and recreation facilities, standards, and principles in the Corte Madera general plan as has heretofore been adopted, as may be amended, and any general plan that may hereafter be adopted by the town shall be the basis for the following dedication requirements. 
(Ord. 591 § 2, 1973) 
17.30.020 - Relation of land dedication to population. 
A.  It is found that in the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety that the standard of four acres for each one thousand residents is the basic amount of property which shall be devoted to local neighborhoods for park and recreational purposes in the town. The amount and location of land to be dedicated or fees to be paid shall bear reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. It shall be based on population densities characteristic for the several types of residential development as determined by the planning commission and result in the following basic formula: 
1.  Single family residences, 3.1 persons-five hundred forty square feet per dwelling unit; 
2.  Multiple dwellings, 2.8 persons-four hundred eighty-eight square feet per dwelling unit. 
B.  The total acreage of recreation space needed to meet the standards set forth shall be the cumulative amount of square feet/acres determined for the respective number of dwelling units in each category which are included in the final subdivision map filed with the town council for approval. This total recreation space shall be reduced by the amount of space required for school recreation grounds as determined by the applicable school site standards of the state. The remaining balance shall be the net requirement for dedication under this chapter. Dedication of land for park or recreational purposes shall not be required in subdivisions containing fifty parcels or less, but payment of fees in lieu thereof shall be required. In subdivisions containing over fifty parcels either land dedication, or fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, may be required in such a ratio as the planning commission deems the most desirable. 
(Ord. 591 § 3, 1973) 
17.30.030 - Amount of fees in lieu of land dedication. 
    Where fees are required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, such fees shall be based on an estimate of the current market value of land in that subdivision as determined by a professional appraiser certified by the California Office of Real Estate Appraisers, selected by the town but paid for by the subdivider. All appraisals required hereunder shall be performed before and as near to the date upon which the fees provided hereunder are to be paid to the town as is practicable; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall said appraisal set forth the current market value based on a valuation date no more than six months from the date the fees are to be paid. The amount of such fees shall be the sum equal to the current market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication according to the foregoing formula. In the case of a combination of fees and land dedication, the fee shall represent a sum equal to the current market value of that land portion which remains after the acreage of dedicated land is deducted from the total acreage requirement which is determined by the planning commission. Such fee shall be deposited in the park and recreation fund, prior to the recordation of the final or parcel map, for the purpose of acquiring, improving, developing, and/or rehabilitating park and recreation facilities which serve the residents of the subdivision. 
(Ord. 783 § 1, 1994: Ord. 591 § 4, 1973) 
17.30.040 - Quality requirements for lands to be dedicated. 
A.  Lands to be dedicated or reserved for park or recreational purposes shall be suitable in the opinion of the planning commission and the park and recreation commission in location, topography, environmental characteristics and development potential as related to the intended use.

(4)  Multiple Houses. Multiple houses, as defined in Section 18.04.520, shall be subject to the following regulations: 
(A)  Findings. The town council and planning commission of the town expressly find that: 
(i)  Condominiums and other forms of ownership of homes are unique and require different amenities and standards than apartment houses to protect the community and the purchasers. 
(ii)  Not all multiple-family dwelling units have been constructed in a manner suitable for individually owned units. 
(iii)  Conversion of existing apartment buildings into multiple houses diminishes the supply of rental housing and, with the exception of limited-equity housing cooperatives, tends to reduce the supply of low-income and moderate-income housing. Such conversions would displace low-income and moderate-income families from the Lower Ross Valley (consisting of the communities of Larkspur, Greenbrae, Kentfield and Corte Madera) whenever a deficiency of multiple-family rental units exists within the Lower Ross Valley. 
(iv)  Conversion of existing apartment buildings into limited-equity housing cooperatives, as defined by Section 33007.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, offers a means to preserve low-income and moderate-income housing in the community. 
(B)  No subdivision map for the construction of, or conversion of any structure to, a multiple house shall be approved unless a use permit is issued as prescribed in Chapter 18.26, Conditional Uses. 
(C)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, certain terms used in this section are defined as follows: 
(i)  "Limited-equity housing cooperative" is as defined by Section 33007.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, and as same may from time to time be amended. 
(ii)  "Shares" mean the units into which the right of exclusive occupancy in a portion of the real property, title to which is held by the corporation, are divided among the owners thereof. 
(D)  In addition to that information specified in Chapter 18.26, Conditional Uses, applications for multiple houses, with the exception of limited-equity housing cooperatives, shall contain the following information: 
(i)  Project Organization. A written description of the proposed project organization, including the use and control of the common areas and recreation facilities within the project; and any proposed control of common facilities to be retained by the developer or by the owner or maintained by any other organization other than the homeowners association or unit owners. 
(ii)  In the case of conversion of a multiple dwelling to a multiple house: 
a.  A report on the proposed conversion covering length of occupancy of present tenants; household composition, including age and number of members of each household; present rent structure; length and terms of lease agreements; estimated sale prices of units and financing arrangements; the names of present tenants who have indicated their intent to purchase a unit; and the names of present tenants likely to be displaced by the conversion; 
b.  A rental history detailing for each unit the size; the current or last rental rate; the monthly rental rate for the preceding three years; the monthly vacancy over the preceding three years; and names of the current tenant or tenants for each unit; 
c.  A written report from a licensed civil engineer or architect and approved by the town building inspector, listing deficiencies under Chapter 15.01 of this code, Uniform Building Code, for new construction of "R" occupancies. 
(E)  Applications for the conversion of a multiple dwelling to a limited-equity housing cooperative shall contain the following information: 
(i)  A copy of the articles, bylaws and any proposed covenants, conditions and restrictions of the proposed cooperative cooperation, and a copy of the purchase agreement or option for the property; 
(ii)  A copy of the management plan for the project, including the following information: 
a.  Characteristics of existing tenants, including income, age, length of occupancy, household composition and present rents, 
b.  The names of present tenants who have indicated in writing their intent to participate in the cooperative, 
c.  A plan to prevent displacement of present tenants who do not want to participate in the cooperative, 
d.  The estimated initial share prices and monthly carrying charges for all units in the cooperative, and the proposed method of financing the conversion; 
(iii)  A report from the town building inspector concerning compliance of the property proposed for conversion with the Uniform Housing Code in effect at the time of application and listing any physical improvements necessary to meet these requirements. 
(F)  In granting a use permit for a multiple house, with the exception of a limited-equity housing cooperative, the planning commission shall make all of the following findings: 
(i)  The application conforms to the general plan; 
(ii)  The property conforms to all requirements of this title, unless a variance has been granted as provided in Chapter 18.28, Variances, or variations of the site development standards have been authorized pursuant to Chapter 18.18, Special Purpose Overlay Districts; 
(iii)  The property meets all requirements of Chapter 15.01 of this code (the Uniform Building Code) as they apply to new construction for Group "R" occupancy, except for such requirements that the planning commission finds unnecessary to fulfill the chapter's objective of ensuring that multiple-family dwellings have been constructed in a manner suitable for individually owned units; 
(iv)  Each dwelling unit has space and connections for the installation and operation of laundry equipment for the private use of the occupants of that unit; 
(v)  At least one hundred cubic feet for each unit and an additional fifty cubic feet for each bedroom of enclosed, weatherproof storage space, either inside or outside the unit, in addition to that required by the Federal Housing Administration's minimum property standards for similar units, is provided for each dwelling unit; 
(vi)  If the permit is for new construction, each dwelling unit has separate utility meters with individual shutoff valves for all utilities. 
(G)  In granting a use permit for the conversion of a multiple dwelling to a multiple house, with the exception of a limited-equity housing cooperative, the planning commission shall also make the following additional findings: 
(i)  No deficiency of multiple-family rental units exists within the Lower Ross Valley. For the purposes of this section, a deficiency is presumed to exist whenever the number of vacant multiple-family rental units within the Lower Ross Valley is five percent or less of all the multiple-family rental units in the Lower Ross Valley; or whenever the proportion of appropriately zoned multiple-family rental units would be reduced to or is already less than twenty-five percent of the total number of dwelling units in the Lower Ross Valley. Procedures for determining the vacancy percentage and proportion of multiple-family rental units shall be set forth by planning commission resolution; 
(ii)  Twenty-five percent of the units will be made permanently available to low- and moderate-income families. 
(iii)  As an alternative to section (ii) above, the project applicant can pay an in-lieu fee, paid to the affordable housing fund to facilitate affordable housing construction to be provided elsewhere in the town. The amount of the in-lieu fee shall be based on the difference between the cost of constructing the affordable dwelling unit and what a low-income family of three can afford. The calculation shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  For purposes of the calculation, the size of the required affordable dwelling unit is established at one thousand five hundred square feet and the cost of construction is assumed to be one hundred sixty dollars per square foot on the adopted date of this ordinance. The cost of construction may be updated annually based on the percentage increase or decrease in the Construction Cost Index as calculated by the Engineering News Record or other similar reputable and nationally-recognized construction cost index. 
(2)  The amount that the low-income household can afford is the sum of two and one-half times sixty-five percent of the median household income, adjusted for a family of three, as updated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for Marin County. 
(3)  The difference between the results of the calculations in (1) and (2) above is the in-lieu fee for one affordable housing unit. To determine the total in-lieu fee, the required number of inclusionary affordable units (both whole and fractional numbers) required of the condominium conversion project shall be multiplied by the in-lieu fee for one affordable housing unit. 
(4)  For smaller condominium conversion projects, the in-lieu fee shall be calculated as follows: one affordable unit for nine market rate units converted. The fractional in-lieu fee for each unit in the project from one to eight units is eleven percent of the fee applicable to nine units. 
(5)  The project applicant may also satisfy this requirement by a combination of providing on-site affordable units permanently available to low- and moderate-income families and payment of in-lieu fees. 
(H)  Whenever the planning commission finds that vacancies in the project have been increased, or elderly or disabled tenants displaced or discriminated against in leasing units, or that evictions have occurred for the purpose of preparing the building for conversion, or if rents in the project over the eighteen months preceding the date of filing the application have been increased substantially greater than any increase in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Department of Labor" (except for increases reasonably related to construction of code required capital improvements directly related to code enforcement, or to recoup the costs thereof), the use permit shall be disapproved and there shall be no reapplication for a conversion for the same property for eighteen months from date of denial. In evaluating the current vacancy level under this paragraph, the increase in rental rates for each unit over the preceding three years and the average monthly vacancy rate for the project over the preceding three years shall be considered. In the evaluation of the displacement of elderly or disabled tenants, any such displacements over the preceding three years, and the reasons therefor, shall be considered. 
(I)  In granting a use permit for conversion of a multiple dwelling to a limited-equity housing cooperative, the planning commission shall make all of the following findings: 
(i)  The application conforms to the general plan; 
(ii)  At least two-thirds of the existing tenants have indicated in writing their intent to participate in the cooperative, or a majority of the tenants have placed ten percent of the proposed share cost in escrow; 
(iii)  Shares in the cooperative shall be made available for low-income and moderate-income households as follows: 
a.  At least twenty-five percent of the total number of shares shall be made available to low-income households at an affordability level at or below that established by resolution of the planning commission, 
b.  The remaining shares shall be made available to moderate-income households at an affordability level at or below that established by resolution of the planning commission, except as provided below, 
c.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares may be made available to any existing tenants who are above moderate income; provided that, upon transfer of these shares, they shall be made available only to low-income or moderate-income households, 
d.  The planning commission shall adopt by resolution low-income and moderate-income levels by family size on an annual basis as defined in Sections 18.04.480 and 18.04.495 of this title. Share cost shall also be considered in determining affordability levels. 
(iv)  Existing tenants who are low-income, handicapped or over age sixty-two, at the time of the initial application, and who do not want to participate in the cooperative, shall receive a lifetime lease for their present unit at monthly rents no greater than present rents, or at twenty-five percent of gross monthly income, if greater than existing rents; provided, that in no case shall monthly rents exceed monthly carrying charges for the cooperative. Annual percentage increases may be required equal to the percentage increase in the San Francisco Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) median income as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). For the purpose of this paragraph a "handicapped person" means a person with: (1) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (2) a record of having such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment. Such term does not include current, illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance; 
(v)  Other existing tenants may continue to lease their present units at monthly rents which are equivalent to the monthly carrying charges of the cooperative members plus the cost of any down payment amortized over a period not to exceed five years, to be determined by the planning commission when reviewing the use permit for conformity with the goal of preserving low-income and moderate-income housing; 
(vi)  Existing tenants who do not want to reside in the cooperative shall receive from the cooperative corporation relocation benefits as described in Section 18.08.030 (6)(K)(ii)(d) of this title; 
(vii)  All shareholders shall live in their units, and the bylaws shall require that owners who cease to be permanent residents shall sell their shares to the cooperative corporation; 
(viii)  The cooperative corporation shall contract with the Marin County housing authority, or with a nonprofit agency designated by the town, to do the following: 
a.  Qualify low-income and moderate-income eligible households to apply to purchase shares in the cooperative. Existing low-income and moderate-income tenants shall have first priority for the initial purchase of shares. The cooperative corporation's board of directors shall have final approval for selection of new members, from the list of eligible applicants, and in the priority order of existing tenants, Corte Madera residents, those who work in Corte Madera but live elsewhere, Marin County residents, and those applicants who work elsewhere in Marin County but live outside the county. The board of directors shall review eligible applicants in priority order, and may rank applicants within each priority category. Eligible applicants shall be permitted to purchase shares in priority order and as ranked within each priority category, 
b.  Monitor compliance of the cooperative corporation with Section 33007.5 of the California Health and Safety Code and conditions set forth in this section. The cooperative corporation shall provide biannual reports for this purpose; 
(ix)  The cooperative corporation shall state in its bylaws that it will increase share values only by an annual inflation allowance not greater than the percentage increase in the median income for the San Francisco SMSA, as established by HUD, or ten percent per year, whichever is less, plus the value of any capital improvements installed at the expense of the member for which prior approval was given by the cooperative corporation; 
(x)  The cooperative corporation shall state in its bylaws that upon sale of the property or dissolution of the corporation, the title of the property and all corporate and private equity shall be transferred to either the Marin County housing authority or to a nonprofit agency designated by the town; 
(xi)  The property meets all requirements of the housing code. 
(J)  In granting a use permit for a multiple house, the planning commission shall require that the conditions, covenants and restrictions for the project, and in the case of a limited-equity cooperative, the bylaws of the corporation, be reviewed by the town attorney to ensure that provisions have been made for the payment of all assessments and taxes, that all common areas will be maintained on an equitable basis, that all provisions of this section have been met, and that all conditions of approval have been complied with. 
(K)  In granting a use permit for a multiple house, with the exception of a limited-equity housing cooperative, the planning commission shall require that: 
(i)  The applicant shall prepare a report describing all deviations from the requirements of Chapter 15.01, Uniform Building Code, authorized pursuant to subsection (5)(e)(iii) of this section. In the case of a conversion of an existing multiple dwelling to a multiple house, the report shall describe the condition of the various physical units of the project. Regarding each element, the report shall state when the unit was built, when it was last replaced, and any variation of its physical conditions from the current building code and zoning ordinance. The subdivider shall provide each purchaser with a copy of the report prior to the execution of any purchase agreement or other contract to purchase a unit in the project, and the developer shall give the purchaser at least seventy-two hours to review the report; 
(ii)  Where a multiple dwelling is converted to a multiple house: 
a.  All present tenants shall be given written notice of intention to convert and an exclusive right to contract for purchase of the unit occupied as required by Section 66427.1 of the California Business and Professions Code, 
b.  All private streets serving the project shall be improved to town standards for public streets or to such standards as may be prescribed by the town engineer, in relation to projected traffic, drainage, and future street maintenance, whether or not the streets are to be offered for dedication, 
c.  If temporary relocation of any tenant is necessary for renovation of a unit between the date of submission of the use permit application and the date established for permanent relocation by subsection (5)(K)(ii)(d) of this section, then the applicant shall find equivalent substitute housing for that tenant for the period of renovation, and shall pay to that tenant any additional cost of the substitute housing and any moving expenses, 
d.  For permanent relocation each tenant not remaining in the project shall be allowed ninety days past the date of recordation of the final map or parcel map, or until the expiration of the tenant's lease, whichever is longer. The applicant shall contract with a relocation service acceptable to the planning director to provide permanent relocation services for such tenant or tenants, and the applicant shall bear the cost of that service and the actual moving expenses of such tenant or tenants for any move within fifty miles of the converted units. The applicant shall also pay a moving expense allowance, equivalent to the cost of moving fifty miles from the converted units, to all tenants moving farther than fifty miles. 
(L)  The planning commission may impose any other condition that it deems reasonable and appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in the general plan, any specific plan, or in the zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Large Family Day Care Homes. The California Health and Safety Code defines the procedures and standards that municipalities may implement to regulate large family day care homes with zoning regulations. Large family day care homes, as defined by Section 18.04.237, shall be subject to the following regulations, consistent with the California Health and Safety Code: 
(A)  Day Care Permit Required. Large family day care homes may be located in any R-1, R-1-A, R-1-B, R-1-C or R-2 residential district provided a "large family day care permit" is obtained in accordance with this section. 
(B)  Application for Large Family Day Care Permit. Application for a large family day care permit for any large family day care homes shall be made to the zoning administrator or his/her designee. The zoning administrator shall issue a large family day care permit to allow for a large family day care home provided that a completed application is submitted which demonstrates that the large family day care homes complies with the standards contained in Section 18.08.030(5)(C). 
(C)  Notice. The zoning administrator shall give notice of the proposed use by mail or delivery to all owners shown on the last equalized assessment roll as owning real property within a three hundred-foot radius of the exterior boundary of the proposed large family day care homes at least ten days prior to the date on which a decision on the application will be made. 
(D)  Appeals. The decision of the zoning administrator granting or denying a large family day care permit may be appealed to the planning commission and then to the town council in accordance with the procedures contained in Chapter 18.34, Appeals. In considering large family day care permit appeals, the planning commission and the town council shall apply the criteria contained in Section 18.08.030(5)(F).

If a project is subject to design review per Section 18.08.220(h), the town may approve less than the maximum allowable FAR to meet design review standards in Chapter 18.30. The "FAR" for an R-1 zoned lot means the gross floor area of all structures on a site calculated under subsection (g)(3) of this section, divided by the net area of land calculated under subsection (g)(4) of this section. 
(2)  The maximum allowable FAR for each lot is determined by lot size using the following formula: 
    On a lot with a net area of land (as defined in subsection (g)(4) of this section) containing four thousand six hundred square feet or less, the maximum FAR shall be .6. 
    On a lot with the net area of land (as defined in subsection (g)(4) of this section) greater than four thousand six hundred square feet and less than seven thousand seven hundred square feet, the maximum FAR shall be determined by the following equation: The sum of ten percent of net area of land plus two thousand three hundred square feet divided by the net area of land. 
    On a lot with a net area of land (as defined in subsection (g)(4) of this section) containing seven thousand seven hundred square feet or more, the maximum FAR shall be .4. 
(3)  The gross floor area of all structures on an R-1 zoned lot shall mean a number equal to the sum of the following: 
(A)  The total enclosed area of all floors of all buildings measured to the outside face of the walls including, but not limited to, subsections (g)(3)A)(i) through (g)(3)(A)(vii) of this section as follows: 
(i)  Stairways and elevator shafts at each floor; 
(ii)  The horizontal floor area of an attic, with the exception of any portion of the horizontal floor area of an attic that is less than seven and one-half feet high when measured from the attic floor to the attic ceiling; 
(iii)  The horizontal area under a vaulted ceiling that is greater than fourteen feet in height from floor to ceiling shall be counted in addition to the gross floor area of the same floor; 
(iv)  Where the top plate or ceiling height (whichever is higher) is five feet or more above the grade of the lot measured at the nearest outside building wall, the floor area, finished or unfinished, immediately beneath that affected top plate or ceiling height shall be counted as gross floor area; 
(v)  Attached garages, not subject to subsection (g)(3)(A)(iv) of this section; 
(vi)  Enclosed detached garages, not subject to subsection (g)(3)(A)(iv) of this section; 
(vii)  Enclosed detached accessory structures (other than garages), not subject to subsection (g)(3)(A)(iv) of this section, except that the first one hundred twenty square feet shall be exempted from the sum total of such structures; 
(B)  The covered area of a carport; 
(C)  The covered area of a front entry porch, except that the first forty square feet of such porch is exempted; and 
(D)  Unenclosed structures (such as covered patios) when more than fifty percent of the exterior sides are enclosed. If such structure is attached to the main building, the attached exterior side of the main building is not counted. 
(4)  The net area of land of an R-1 zoned lot shall mean the total horizontal area included within the boundary lines of a site, exclusive of the following: 
(A)  Water area within Lagoon No. 1 and Lagoon No. 2; 
(B)  Waterbodies and waterways measured at 6.2 feet NAVD; 
(C)  Dedicated street rights-of-way; 
(D)  The area within easements for roadway, driveway, parking, flood control, pedestrian or bicycle access ways. 
    Nothing in this section shall affect the ability of the planning commission or planning director to take into consideration any area within the lot not included in the calculation of the net area of land that could otherwise be considered in the determination of an application for a variance to exceed maximum allowable FAR standards. 
    The floor area ratio provisions shall be applicable to development applications for the R-1 residential district that have not been deemed "complete" as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter (December 20, 2007). 
(h)  Design Review. Design review approval is required for all structures except: 
(1)  Additions to structures less than fifteen feet in height and less than two hundred fifty square feet in area. (See Figure 13);

II. - MX-1 Mixed Use Tamal Vista Corridor District 

18.13.100 - Purpose. 
    The MX-1 district is intended to implement General Plan land use policies adopted for the Tamal Vista Boulevard commercial area between Madera Boulevard and Wornum Drive and the recommendations of the Tamal Vista Corridor Study Report. The MX-1 district is intended to create a mixed residential and non-residential district, where such uses coexist on a single site or across multiple sites, while reinforcing and supporting existing commercial uses and enhancing the amenities available to surrounding residential communities. 
    A primary purpose of the district is to facilitate the improvement of the eastern Tamal Vista Boulevard streetscape by ensuring that new development facilitates upgrades to sidewalks and bicycle infrastructure, and add pedestrian scaled development that serves to enhance the vitality and appearance of the adjacent properties. Such improvements are also intended to facilitate greater pedestrian and bicycle traffic along the corridor and provide a suitable means of travel between new and existing residential development and the retail services, shops, and restaurants at the Town Center, thereby reducing otherwise needed vehicle trips. 
    The MX-1 district is also intended to result in development that is better integrated into the existing residential neighborhoods along Tamal Vista Boulevard by limiting the scale of development closest to Tamal Vista Boulevard, requiring adequate setbacks, and defining a range of commercial uses more appropriate in a residential setting. 
(Ord. No. 958, § 6(Exh. A), 10-18-2016)

II. - HLC Hillside Land Capacity Overlay District 

18.18.100 - Generally. 
    The hillside land capacity overlay district established by this chapter is intended to apply to hillside parcels with a potential for substantial additional development, with a slope of more than ten percent, and which comprise any part of the ridges, sideslopes or extensions of Corte Madera Ridge, Meadowsweet Ridge or Tiburon Peninsula Ridge. The specific parcels within the HLC hillside land capacity overlay district are designated "hillsides, ridgelands, and related habitat" on Figure 8, Open Space, of the general plan and are shown on the town zoning map. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.105 - Development standards. 
    The following regulations shall apply to the site of any proposed development within the district: 
(1)  A geologic investigation and report by a qualified engineering geologist may be required for any proposed development, and shall be required for any proposed development on a site containing significant areas with slopes of thirty percent or more, and/or any site designated as "3" or "4" in the map entitled "Interpretation of the Relative Stability of Upland Slopes in the Tiburon Peninsula, Sausalito, and Adjacent Areas, Marin County, California, 1976," prepared by the California Division of Mines and Geology, which map forms the basis of Figure 11, Relative Slope Stability, in the general plan. 
    In addition, the planning director may require that a geologic investigation and report be prepared for areas off the site that may cause a hazard on the site. 
(2)  No portion of a site with a slope of thirty percent or more, and no portion of a site designated as "4" in the map entitled "Interpretation of the Slope Stability of Upland Slopes in the Tiburon Peninsula, Sausalito, and Adjacent Areas, Marin County, California, 1976," prepared by the California Division of Mines and Geology, shall be proposed for development except as the boundaries of these areas may be refined on the basis of an engineering geologic investigation and report prepared by a qualified engineering geologist. The report shall identify those areas where unstable slopes and other geologic hazards can be eliminated with minor modification of the existing land form and vegetation, areas for which elimination of the hazard would result in major modification of the existing land form, removal of, or potential damage to, established natural vegetation, or exposure of slopes that cannot suitably be revegetated, and areas determined to be too hazardous for development. 
(3)  Development shall preserve the natural qualities of sloping terrain rather than shaping a site for the purpose of facilitating development or increasing development intensity. 
(4)  The density established on the general plan diagram for a parcel of land may be reduced if slope stability evaluation indicates a geologic or slope stability hazard; provided, that in no case shall a parcel be deemed undevelopable if it can meet health and safety standards. 
(5)  No building shall be located directly on a visible ridge unless the planning commission finds that there is no other location on the site which can accommodate a building consistent with all other regulations and constraints applicable to the zone(s) in which the site is located. Any portion of any development proposed to be located within fifty vertical feet of the ridgeline as defined in Chapter 18.04, Definitions, points of elevation fifty feet below and on both sides of the ridgeline, or proposed to be located in any area identified within the scenic resources overlay district as shown on Figure 8, Open Space, in the general plan, shall be evaluated on the basis of a visual analysis prepared by an architect, landscape architect or other qualified professional. This analysis shall include view sections from areas within the town designated by the planning director and shall be subject to the special site plan and design guidelines prescribed by Chapter 18.30, Design Review. 
    The visual analysis shall consider the type and extent of natural vegetation and tree cover on the site and shall contain recommendations on: the limits to which the vegetation and tree cover can be removed without significant adverse visual impact; the most effective method of revegetation where a slope is cleared in preparing the site for development; and the treatment of building sites on hill slopes devoid of natural tree cover. 
    Dedication of ridgetop land and/or the provision of a trail segment through a portion of the site may be required as a condition of approval of a preliminary development plan or a precise development plan. 
(6)  For proposed development within an area designated "high or moderately high fire hazard" by the safety element of the general plan, a study and report by a registered civil engineer and qualified biologist shall be required. The biologist's report shall include a classification of the site or portions of the site by degree of risk related to possible damage to structures from wildland fires in the existing plant communities and shall contain specific recommendations for preventing damage to structures from wildland fires. The civil engineer's report shall evaluate the adequacy of the water supply on the site for fire fighting purposes and shall contain specific recommendations for ensuring that all new development provides a water supply for firefighting meeting the standards of the town's fire chief. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.110 - Permitted density of development. 
    The maximum number of units that may be permitted on a site shall be determined in the following manner: 
(1)  All measurements shall be in square feet or, if in acres, to the nearest tenth of an acre, as most appropriate to the size of the site. 
(2)  The total area of all portions of the site designated as "4" on the map entitled "Interpretation of the Slope Stability of Upland Slopes in the Tiburon Peninsula, Sausalito, and Adjacent Areas, Marin County, California 1976," prepared by the California Division of Mines and Geology, shall be calculated, and no credit shall be given for these areas except as provided below. For purposes of the preliminary development plan, the boundaries of these areas may be transferred from available maps. Adjustments of the boundaries may be made at a later stage in the review process on the basis of more precise data available from an engineering geologic soil report. 
    Where the engineering geologic soil report indicates that an identified hazardous condition can be eliminated with only minor modification of the existing land form and vegetation, the area may be considered eligible for purposes of the calculations prescribed in subsection (3) of this section; however, if the report reveals the presence of a hazardous condition that cannot be eliminated with only minor modification of existing land form and vegetation, such area shall not be considered eligible for purposes of the calculations. 
(3)  The maximum number of units that may be permitted in a proposed development shall be determined by multiplying the area of land in each slope category by the capacity factor shown in the following schedule (Section 18.18.115), adding the products of these calculations converted to square feet, and dividing this figure by the required site area per unit in square feet prescribed in the underlying zoning district. 
(4)  Parcels which fall entirely within the slopes of thirty percent or greater category, or entirely within the designation of "4" on Figure 11, Slope Stability, in the general plan shall be permitted to develop one single-family dwelling subject to the adequate provision of water, sewage disposal, access and geologic stability.

    Prior to the approval of any development within the HLC overlay district, the following findings shall be made: 
(1)  The project mitigates any identified geologic or seismic hazard concerns; 
(2)  No building is located within fifty feet of a ridge (provided, that there is another location on the site which can accommodate a building consistent with other regulations and constraints applicable to the district in which the site is located); 
(3)  The visual impact of any development has been mitigated, including but not limited to retention of existing vegetation where possible and revegetation as directed; 
(4)  The development incorporates adequate mitigation for fire protection as determined by the town's fire chief. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
III. - BRNH Baylands Risk Zone and Natural Habitat Overlay District 

18.18.200 - Generally. 
    The baylands risk zone and natural habitat overlay district established by this chapter is intended to apply to lands which have a potential for substantial additional development, have less than ten percent slope, and are underlain by bay mud as defined in the map entitled, "Interpretation of the Relative Stability of Upland Slopes in the Tiburon Peninsula, Sausalito, and Adjacent Areas, Marin County, California, 1976," prepared by the California Division of Mines and Geology. The specific area within the BRNH baylands risk zone and natural habitat overlay district is designated "wetlands, unique marshland, and related habitat" and "waterbodies/waterways and related habitat" on Figure 2, General Plan Diagram, of the general plan, and is shown on the town zoning map. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.205 - Development standards. 
    The following development standards shall apply to the site of any proposed development within the district. 
(1)  A comprehensive geologic and soil investigation and report, prepared by a qualified engineering geologist, shall be required for any proposed development on a site underlain by bay mud or on a site which in its present form was created by man-made fill, as shown on the above-referenced maps. The report shall include a classification of the site or portions of the site by degree of risk related to possible damage to structures and improvements, including underground utilities, damage resulting from subsidence, differential settlement, seismic event, or other failure, taking into account all pertinent factors, including but not limited to the following: 
(A)  Depth of bedrock; 
(B)  Thickness of bay mud underlying the site; 
(C)  Characteristics and thickness of layers and/or lenses of sand or shell deposits that may be present in the bay mud; 
(D)  Thickness, age and type of fill that created the site or portion of the site, including an estimate of the amount of final settlement yet to occur; 
(E)  An estimate of the probable effects of a major earthquake, including liquefaction, subsidence or differential settlement and fill failure caused by accelerated compaction, lateral flow of the mud beneath the fill, or other possible effects; 
(F)  Areas likely to be inundated by a tsunami. 
    Based on the risk zone or zones so identified, the report shall contain specific recommendations with respect to portions of the site within which the risk is too great to permit any type of development involving a habitable structure, if any; types of uses and structures that would be appropriate considering the degree of risk; fill techniques that should be employed to minimize the possibility of failure; special engineering standards and requirements for utility installations, including emergency shutoff or bypass valve systems; special foundations and structural standards that should be employed for structures and other improvements; and any other safety standards that should be incorporated into the design of the proposed development. 
    Where authorized by the town engineer, the report may be prepared in two parts: the first containing a description and identification of problems associated with the site, including an analysis of the severity of the problems, to be submitted with the preliminary plan; and the second containing all of the required details and recommendations, to be submitted with the precise plan. 
(2)  For a proposed development on a site designated as "unique marshland habitat" by the general plan, a study and report by a qualified environmental biologist or other specialist in the field shall be required. The report shall classify and document the site in terms of its unique, intrinsic value as wildlife habitat, and where there are differences in the value or sensitivity of portions of the site, shall rate them in order of lowest to highest wildlife resource value. Based on these classifications and ratings, the report shall contain specific recommendations on portions of the site that should not be disturbed in any manner, portions of the site that can sustain limited modification without major loss of resource value, and portions of the site best suited to development. 
    Within the areas found to be suitable for development, the report shall contain recommendations on the design and spacing of structures and improvements including buildings, roads, parking areas, fences or walls, utilities and landscaping that would provide the greatest amount of protection for the habitat, would be least disruptive to natural processes essential to its preservation, would result in minimum alteration of the natural setting, and would provide visual and/or public access to shoreline areas. 
(3)  For a proposed development on a site designated as being within the area of "special flood hazard" by the flood insurance rate map of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, a study and report by a registered civil engineer shall be required. The report shall include a classification of the site, or portions of the site, by degree of risk related to possible damage to structures and improvements resulting from flooding and shall contain specific recommendations for preventing flood damage to structures and improvements. 
    Where authorized by the town engineer, the report may be prepared in two parts, the first containing a description of the problems associated with the site and a general description of the solutions, to be submitted with the preliminary plan, and the second containing all of the required details and recommendations, to be submitted with the precise plan. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.210 - Permitted density of development. 
    Except for additional units that may be permitted in accord with Section 18.08.040, the maximum number of dwelling units that may be permitted on the site shall be determined in the following manner: 
(1)  If adjacent to a natural waterway or tidal zone, the area of all portions of the site below 3.5 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum shall not be counted; 
(2)  After subtracting the total area prescribed in subsection (1) of this section from the area of the lot, the maximum number of units that may be permitted in the proposed development shall be determined by multiplying the area of land in each elevation category by the capacity factor shown in the following schedule (Section 18.18.215), adding the products of these calculations, and dividing this figure by the required site area per unit in square feet prescribed by the underlying zoning district.

(1)  The project protects and preserves saltwater and freshwater wetlands and related habitats, and protects and preserves the water quality of wetlands; 
(2)  The project provides an acceptable level of risk related to possible damage to structures and improvements, including underground utilities, resulting from subsidence, differential settlement, seismic event or other failure and flood hazard. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
IV. - P-D Planned Development Overlay District 

18.18.300 - Generally. 
    The planned development overlay district established by this chapter is intended to apply to undeveloped lands with the potential for substantial additional development not otherwise classified in the HLC hillside land capacity overlay district or the BRNH baylands risk zone and natural habitat overlay district. The area within which the P-D planned development overlay district may be applied is shown on the town zoning map. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.305 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the P-D planned development overlay district is to provide locations for well-planned developments that conform with the general plan, although the developments vary in certain aspects from the regulations of the zoning district with which it is combined. The planned development provisions are intended to allow freedom of design to obtain developments which will be an asset to the town by equalling or surpassing the quality required by the regulations of the district with which the planned development overlay district is combined. The objectives of the planned development overlay district are to achieve one or more of the following purposes: 
(1)  To permit the development or enlargement of commercial districts in close proximity to residential areas, which protect the character and quality of the adjacent residential uses, and to permit appropriate and limited commercial uses within planned residential projects; 
(2)  To permit clusters of multiple-unit residential developments in appropriate locations within single-family residential zones, with appropriate conditions imposed to protect surrounding areas; 
(3)  To protect the appearance and character of areas of public interest or high visibility such as civic centers, public buildings and grounds, parks, monument areas, and features (natural or man-made) of local or historical significance; 
(4)  To permit flexibility in the design and use of an individually owned property or a group of separately owned properties to allow for economy, convenience and amenity in development, provided conditions are met which are required by the planning commission, town council and this title. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.310 - Application of district. 
    The P-D planned development overlay district shall be applied as shown on the town zoning map. Applications to rezone lands to the P-D overlay district shall be accompanied by a preliminary plan consistent with Section 18.18.035, except that where the P-D overlay district is initiated by the town council or the planning commission, the application may be accompanied only by a proposed policy statement describing the uses to be allowed and the conditions, general or specific, that are to apply to any development. In the event that a P-D overlay district, so initiated, is established with the approval of a policy statement only, all uses within the district shall require a conditional use permit, approved by the planning commission after a duly noticed public hearing. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.315 - Development standards. 
    In considering a proposed preliminary plan and policy statement, the planning commission and the town council, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter, may require higher standards or allow different standards for the P-D overlay district than are required for the district with which it is combined with respect to building location, density, uses, heights, parking, traffic circulation, landscaping, lot sizes, and other standards and requirements provided such modified standards, requirements and regulations are adopted as part of the preliminary plan and policy statement, and are in conformance with the general plan. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.320 - Maximum density of development. 
(a)  Except for additional units that may be permitted in accord with Section 18.08.040, the maximum number of dwelling units that may be permitted on the site shall be determined by dividing the site area by the required site area per unit prescribed in the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  The computation of the maximum number of units is intended solely to set up an absolute maximum. A lesser number of units may prove to be the maximum permitted based upon environmental constraints or compliance with other P-D planned development requirements. 
(c)  No absolute minimum lot widths and depths are specified. 
(d)  Buildable area is defined in Section 18.04.085. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.325 - Zone change approval. 
    Adoption of the ordinance rezoning property to the P-D overlay district shall include approval of, at a minimum, preliminary plan and policy statement, except as provided in Section 18.18.310. Any planned development overlay district shall be subject to all conditions imposed by the ordinance establishing the district and shall be exempted from other provisions of this code only to the extent specified in such ordinance or the approved development plan and policy statement. Requests to modify, change or revise any approved development plan or policy statement shall be processed in the same manner as any other change of zone application, and shall be considered against the original development plan and policy statement and the conditions retained at the time the modification is requested, except that minor modifications which do not increase the approved density or change the approved uses may be allowed by design review approval. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.330 - Status of approved plan for planned development. 
    The approved development plan and policy statement for a P-D overlay district shall govern all development of the property within the district. If approval is granted for subsequent division of property within a planned development district, the approved development plan and policy statement shall govern the development on each parcel created by the division. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.335 - Subdivision of planned development. 
    The planning commission and town council may approve the division of a planned unit development into lots or into condominium ownership, subject to the finding that adequate provisions are provided to ensure the perpetual maintenance of all areas and improvements proposed to be owned in common, or to be maintained in common, and to ensure that additional development will conform with the approved development plan and policy statement. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.340 - Design review approval. 
    Notwithstanding Section 18.18.015, all structures, buildings, or other improvements in a P-D overlay district shall obtain design review approval before building permits are issued, whether or not a precise plan is needed. In addition to criteria established in Chapter 18.30, Design Review, the planning commission shall evaluate the planned development design review application based on the following criteria: 
(1)  In general, the project shall be designed to fit the existing topography; the site shall not be significantly graded to accommodate the project; 
(2)  The proposed density does not exceed the maximum allowed density; 
(3)  Final contours and slopes shall generally reflect existing landforms; in particular, building pads and terraces interspersed with slopes shall not be created, and ridgelines, knolls and significant tree masses shall be preserved; 
(4)  The proposed development seeks to avoid significantly intruding into the views, privacy, and sunlight of adjoining residences; 
(5)  Views from public open space areas, rights-of-way, and other public places and of major public open space areas are not significantly affected; 
(6)  Wide pads or level areas are not created to accommodate roads. Roads should be fit into the existing topography; one-way roads may be preferred over two-way roads to reduce grading, and on-street parking should be parallel to the road, not perpendicular; 
(7)  Buildings, parking, carports and landscaping shall be arranged so that view corridors from downslope lots are created. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.345 - Findings for the adoption of a planned development overlay district. 
    Rezoning to the P-D overlay district shall be permitted subject to the following findings: 
    The project as set forth in the preliminary development plan has utilized the freedom of design permitted by the P-D district to obtain a development in conformance with the general plan and of superior quality and which is: 
(1)  Compatible in appearance, character and scale with surrounding developments; 
(2)  Environmentally sensitive; 
(3)  Suitable in mass, bulk, and proportions for its use, the size of parcel(s), and the environmental qualities; 
(4)  Achieves variety and interest of design and materials. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
V. - CTH Christmas Tree Hill Overlay District 

18.18.400 - Generally. 
    The purpose of the CTH Christmas Tree Hill overlay district is to implement the Christmas Tree Hill community plan and provide for infill development and reconstruction of existing development in a manner that preserves the neighborhood character, the environmental and scenic qualities of the area, and protects the health and safety of persons and property on the Hill. 
    Consistent with Section 18.18.010 (1) of this chapter, permitted densities, uses and development standards shall be regulated by the underlying zoning district. 
    The specific standards and regulations provided herein address the unique development conditions on Christmas Tree Hill: 
(1)  The roads on Christmas Tree Hill are steep, narrow and winding; 
(2)  There are many small developed lots with severely limited off-street parking; 
(3)  Christmas Tree Hill is heavily vegetated and developed with numerous older, wooden structures resulting in high fuel loading and severe fire hazard; 
(4)  The road configuration and proliferation of on-street parking limit emergency access to all Christmas Tree Hill residents and property, as well as evacuation of residents in the event of fire, natural disaster, or other emergency; 
(5)  Infrastructure facilities, including drainage and roads, are limited in their ability to accommodate additional development, including, but not limited to, residential expansions, new residential units and additional dwelling units; 
(6)  Retention of the single-family residential character is important to the residents of the Christmas Tree Hill community; 
(7)  A variety of physical, economic, and social living environments is desirable to the Christmas Tree Hill community. 
    This district has been created for Christmas Tree Hill, consistent with the goals and policies of the Christmas Tree Hill community plan, and shall be applied as shown on the town zoning map.

    The following regulations shall apply to any proposed development within the district. 
(1)  Definitions. The following definitions supersede or augment those found in Chapter 18.04, Definitions, of this title. 
    Frontage or Front Property Line. In the area of the Corte Madera Woods Subdivision, for planning purposes only, the frontage or front property line, or any property line adjacent to an existing paved roadway, shall be determined to be located twenty feet from the centerline of the existing roadway, regardless of extent of pavement. 
    Lot Size. For planning purposes only, lot size shall be calculated from the recorded subdivision maps. For lots created by the 1912 amended map of Corte Madera Woods, any roadway shown on the subdivision map which is included within the lot shall be subtracted from the total square footage to determine the lot area. Trails or trail easements are not deleted from calculation of lot area.

CHRISTMAS TREE HILL FRONT PROPERTY LINE AND LOT AREA 

(2)  General Development Principles and Standards. 
(A)  The location, orientation and design of building sites, fences and other structures, and streets and other circulation elements, shall maintain and preserve natural topography, vegetative cover, and significant landmarks and trees. 
(B)  New construction and reconstruction shall minimize impact on surrounding properties and shall be in harmony with the cottage character of Christmas Tree Hill. 
(C)  Building mass shall be in proportion to the lot size and shall maintain a feeling of open space on the lot. New construction shall be located on the least environmentally damaging and visually disruptive portions of the site. 
(D)  Where health and safety conditions permit, exceptions to town street standards may be made to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. 
(3)  Specific Development Standards. 
(A)  All construction in the CTH overlay district, except as specifically exempted below, shall obtain design review approval prior to issuance of any building or construction permits. 
    Design review approval shall be in accordance with the standards and procedures of Chapter 18.30, Design Review, the design review findings of this chapter, and the design review guidelines adopted by town council Resolution No. 2769 for Christmas Tree Hill. 
(B)  Exemptions from design review shall be granted for: 
(i)  Single-family home additions with all of the following characteristics: no greater than one hundred square feet of floor area, less than fifteen feet in height, and not including a window or deck; 
(ii)  Accessory structures which are no larger than fifty square feet and less than six feet in height. 
(iii)  Fences, walls and hedges less than four feet in height in the front yard or any portion abutting a street. 
    Notwithstanding the above exemptions, colors and materials for any development or project shall conform to the design review guidelines for Christmas Tree Hill adopted by town council Resolution No. 2769. 
(C)  Lot size shall be calculated as described above and in Chapter 18.04, Definitions. These calculations shall be used in the determination of subdivision potential and the establishment of building coverage. 
(D)  Location of any property line adjacent to any existing roadway shall be determined as described above and in Chapter 18.04, Definitions, and shall be used in the determination of encroachments and the establishment of setbacks for structures. 
(E)  Where the property line abuts an existing roadway, setbacks for yards shall be flexible, and shall be determined through the design review process based on specific site characteristics such as: slope stability, retention of existing vegetation, minimization of disruption to the site and surrounding area, privacy, view and sunlight for the subject parcel and neighboring parcels, maintenance of existing neighborhood character and scale, roadway line of sight, and visual and/or physical intrusion on the roadway. Unless specifically dictated by the above standards, side and rear yard setbacks shall be established by the underlying district (see R-1-A and R-1 zoning districts for side and rear yard setbacks). 
(F)  The maximum height for structures is thirty feet, but may be reduced through the design review process. Single-story construction is strongly preferred, except where the second story can step into an existing slope and minimize environmental disruption. 
(G)  A detailed site plan, as required in the design review application shall show the area and dimensions of the building envelope, building setbacks, and permissible coverage of lot by structures, shall be established upon design review approval as described in Section 18.30.070 of this title. Location of any new exterior construction shall be reviewed to determine the least environmentally damaging and visually disruptive placement. 
(H)  A minimum of two off-street parking spaces per primary dwelling unit shall be provided, the location and design of which shall be determined in accordance with the principles and standards of Chapter 18.20, Off-Street Parking and Loading. Off-street parking requirements for all other uses within the district and standards for street parking facilities shall be as provided in Chapter 18.20, Off-Street Parking and Loading. 
    Where feasible, an apron for two tandem parking spaces shall be provided in addition to the required spaces. Notwithstanding Chapter 18.20, Off-Street Parking and Loading, size and dimension of individual parking spaces shall be determined on a site-specific basis, and all spaces may be uncovered. For purposes of health and safety, parking structures should be sited far enough from the travel lanes to permit a clear view of oncoming traffic. 
(I)  Structures now located in the area on the road side of the property line are deemed nonconforming, and their replacement, repair and maintenance shall be governed by Chapter 18.32, Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Sites. Notwithstanding Section 18.32.070, where a nonconforming structure is voluntarily demolished to any extent, or required by law to be demolished to any extent, the planning commission may permit the rebuilding of the structure in the original footprint if the following findings are made: 
(i)  The nonconforming location is the most appropriate location for the structure based on its use; 
(ii)  The location of the structure within the original footprint does not create a hazard to public health or safety. 
(J)  Encroachments into the public right-of-way as defined in this section and in Chapter 18.04, Definitions, shall be reviewed by the planning commission. A minimum setback of eighteen inches shall be required from the shoulder of the roadway for fences, walls and hedges except as allowed on a case-by-case basis for replacement structures. 
(K)  Consistent with the recognition of the unique physical constraints on Christmas Tree Hill, as described in Section 18.18.400, this section seeks to limit and distribute additional dwelling units on the Hill, acknowledging that, if overdeveloped, additional dwelling units will jeopardize the health and safety of persons residing in the area. "Overloading the capacity of the neighborhood" is defined as the number of additional dwelling units exceeding ten percent of the total number of primary residential units existing in the area on the date this section becomes effective. Christmas Tree Hill has been divided into capacity districts (see Figure 16). In each capacity district, the percentages of the total allowable units are as follows: 
Capacity District Percent 1 10 2 7 3 7 4 8 5 7 6 11 7 7 8 8 9 8 10 14 11 13  
Example: With two hundred fifty dwelling units on Christmas Tree Hill, a total of twenty-five second units are permitted. Capacity District 4, with eight percent of the total dwelling units, is allowed two second units. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.410 - Additional dwelling units. 
(a)  In recognition of the approximate pattern of town-approved additional dwelling units to date, to minimize impacts of additional dwelling units in any particular area, and to provide for an even, equitable distribution of these additional dwelling units, capacity districts have been delineated as shown on the Christmas Tree Hill capacity map. (See Figure 16.) 
(b)  Additional dwelling units on parcels greater than twenty thousand square feet in size shall not be considered overloading the capacity of the neighborhood, and therefore shall not be included in calculating the maximum allowable number of dwelling units. 
(c)  The allowed maximum total number of additional dwelling units shall include existing legal additional dwelling units and future additional dwelling units, except those excluded above. If a capacity district already contains more than its allotted number, by virtue of the existence of legal conforming and legal nonconforming additional dwelling units, these units shall not be rendered illegal by the provisions of this section. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.415 - Figure 16 Christmas Tree Hill capacity district map. 

(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.420 - Design review findings. 
    In addition to the findings required in Section 18.30, Design Review, the following specific findings shall be made to grant design review approval in the CTH overlay district: 
(1)  The proposed development protects the natural and existing land forms and vegetation of the hillside and ridges located on the property. Ridgetop development is precluded if any other location of the parcel is feasible for development; 
(2)  The grading plan is designed to retain the natural and existing features of the land; cuts and fills are minimized; and all graded areas are rounded and contoured to blend with the existing topography. Drainage swales, slopes, vistas and other natural features are retained to the maximum degree feasible; 
(3)  Building site locations and access to building sites are selected to reduce visibility of the development from the remainder of the community; 
(4)  To the maximum extent feasible, access drives have been contoured to minimize the scarring effects of hillside road construction. Access drives should be allowed to be as narrow as traffic generation and public safety (including emergency vehicle access) permit; 
(5)  All slopes are planted or otherwise protected from erosion, including benching or terracing where appropriate; 
(6)  Yard setbacks have been determined based on specific site characteristics, line of sight from roadway, and relationships to adjoining properties; 
(7)  Structures and landscaping retain the natural features of the site and the character of Christmas Tree Hill as it is viewed from public roads on the Hill and distant views from off the Hill. Newly planted landscape materials will not ultimately block existing significant views from nearby dwelling units; 
(8)  The proposed development does not adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of persons in or adjacent to the area or endanger property located in the area; 
(9)  Impacts on neighboring residences are minimized; 
(10)  All proposed structures in the public right-of-way conform to the design guidelines of this district and the standards for nonconforming structures in this chapter, and do not restrict safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation; 
(11)  The proposed development and its use is in conformance with the general plan, the adopted Christmas Tree Hill community plan and Christmas Tree Hill design review guidelines. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.18.425 - Review procedures. 
(a)  Public notice for all applications shall be given as prescribed in Chapter 18.36, Administration, except as follows: 
    If the application includes a request for a new house, new driveway, change in off-street parking, subdivision, lot line adjustment, notice of merger, certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance, then public notice shall be mailed to all persons shown on the latest equalized assessment roll of the county as owning property within the Christmas Tree Hill area. 
    In addition, applications shall be noticed by mail to all interested community groups on file with the planning department. 
(b)  Design review procedures shall be as prescribed in Chapter 18.30, Design Review.

Sections: 

18.23.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to regulate the cultivation of medicinal and adult use cannabis for personal use in a manner that is consistent with state law and that balances the needs of medical patients and their caregivers, and the interests of personal use cultivators, while promoting the health, safety and welfare of the residents and businesses within the town and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public, and to ensure that cannabis grown for personal use remains secure and does not find its way to persons under the age of twenty one who are not authorized patients, or to illicit markets. This chapter shall not be enforced to conflict with state law rights of qualified patients or qualified primary caregivers. Nothing in this section is intended to authorize the cultivation, possession, or use of cannabis in violation of state law.

(a)  Development projects that include from between one to nine total dwelling units shall provide an affordable dwelling unit for one low-income household. As an alternative, the project applicant can pay an in-lieu fee, paid to the affordable housing fund, for housing to be provided elsewhere in the town. The amount of the in-lieu fee shall be based on the difference between the cost of constructing the affordable dwelling unit and what a low-income family of three can afford. The calculation shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  For purposes of the calculation, the size of the required affordable dwelling unit is established at one thousand five hundred square feet and the cost of construction is assumed to be one hundred twenty-five dollars per square foot. The cost of construction may be updated annually, by resolution of the town council, based on actual cost data. 
(2)  The amount that the low-income household can afford is the sum of two and one-half times sixty-five percent of the median household income, adjusted for a family of three, as updated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for Marin County. 
(3)  The difference between the results of the calculations in Sections 18.24.120 (a)(1) and (2) above is the in-lieu fee for a development of nine total units. The in-lieu fee for each unit in a development of from one to eight units is eleven percent of the fee calculated for nine units. 
(b)  Development projects that include ten or more total dwelling units shall provide the following affordable housing. In-lieu fee contributions to the affordable housing fund are not allowed as a substitute for providing dwelling units. If the results of the following calculations are less than 0.5 the number shall be rounded off to the next lower number, and if the results are 0.5 or 
greater the number shall be rounded off to the next higher number. The following number of units shall be provided: 
(1)  Five percent of units for very low-income households; 
(2)  Ten percent of units for low-income households; and 
(3)  Ten percent of units for moderate-income households. 
(c)  Affordable dwelling units produced pursuant to this section shall be legally restricted to ensure their continued affordability for a period of at least fifty-five years.

iii.  If the incentive or concession includes mixed use development, the finding included in Government Code Section 65915 relating to mixed use projects are met. 
iv.  If a waiver or modification of a development standard is requested, the developer has demonstrated, for each requested waiver or modification, that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible and that the development standards from which a waiver or modification is requested will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development at the densities to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to this section or with the concessions and incentives permitted by this section. 
v.

iv.  The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law. 
5.  The approval body may deny a waiver or reduction of a development standard which would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the development only if it makes a written finding based upon substantial evidence of either of the following: 
i.

Chapter 18.25 - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 

18.25.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodation in zoning and other land use regulations, policies, practices and procedures of the town in order to fully comply with the intent and purpose of the fair housing laws. It is the intent of the town pursuant to the fair housing laws to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with disabilities. 
(Ord. No. 947, § 4, 1-20-2015) 
A.  "Applicant" means an individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a zoning or other land use regulation, policy, practice or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities for individual(s) with disabilities. 
B.  "Director" means the planning director or his/her designee. 
C.  "Disability" means, with respect to an individual, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; a record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment. "physical or mental impairment," "major life activities," "record of such impairment," and "regarded as having such an impairment" are defined in the Americans With Disabilities Act Title III regulations codified at 28 CRF Part 36. 
D.  "Fair housing laws" means the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 3601, et seq.), including reasonable accommodation required by 42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(3)(B), and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (California Government Code Section 12900, et seq.), including reasonable accommodation required specifically by California Government Code Sections 12927(c)(1) and 12955(1), as any of these statutory provisions now exist or may be amended from time to time. 
E.  "Reasonable accommodation" means providing individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities flexibility in the application of zoning or other land use regulations, policies, practices and procedures, or waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities. 
(Ord. No. 947, § 4, 1-20-2015) 
18.25.030 - Notice to the public of availability of accommodation process. 
    Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at public information counters that accept planning and building applications, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals. Town employees shall direct individuals to the display whenever they are requested to do so or reasonably believe that individuals with disabilities or their representatives may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall be available to the public in the planning department. 
(Ord. No. 947, § 4, 1-20-2015) 
18.25.40 - Requesting reasonable accommodation. 
A.  In order to make housing available to an individual with a disability, an applicant may request a reasonable accommodation in land use regulations, policies, practices and procedures. 
B.  All requests shall be reasonable and limited to the minimum that the applicant believes is necessary to accommodate the disability. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be in writing and provide the following information: 
1.  Name and address of the applicant; 
2.  Name and address of the property owner(s); 
3.  Address of the property for which accommodation is requested; 
4.  The current use of the property for which accommodation is requested;

6.  The basis for the claim that the fair housing laws apply to the individual(s) with a disability and evidence supporting the claim, which may be in the form of a letter from a medical doctor or other licensed healthcare professional, a handicapped license, or other appropriate evidence; 
7.  Reason that the requested accommodation may be necessary for the individual(s) with the disability to use and enjoy the property; and 
8.  How the property will be used by the applicant and individual(s) with disabilities. 
C.  To the extent permitted by law, any information identified by the applicant as confidential shall be retained by the town in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the individual with a disability and shall not be made available for public inspection. 
D.  A request for reasonable accommodation in regulations, policies, practices and procedures may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable accommodation does not affect an applicant's obligation to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested reasonable accommodation. 
E.  If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the town will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. 
(Ord. No. 947, § 4, 1-20-2015) 
18.25.050 - Reviewing authority and required criteria.

Chapter 18.26 - CONDITIONAL USES 
Sections: 

18.26.010 - Purposes and authorization. 
(a)  To allow for uses within a zoning district which, by the conditions, are made compatible with the primary uses of the district. 
(b)  To give the use regulations the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of this title and to account for the widely varying needs of some uses, certain conditional uses are permitted in each district subject to the granting of a conditional use permit. Conditional uses include various types of public and private structures and uses which do not precisely fit into the zoning district classifications. Because of their unusual characteristics, conditional uses require special consideration so that they may be located properly with respect to the objectives of this title and with respect to their effects on surrounding properties. To achieve these purposes, the planning commission or zoning administrator is empowered to grant and to deny applications for use permits and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of use permits. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994)

    At the public hearing, the planning commission shall review the application and the drawings and other documents submitted therewith, and shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposed use and the proposed conditions under which the use would be operated or maintained, particularly with respect to the findings prescribed in Section 18.26.050. 
    For use permit applications reviewed by the zoning administrator, no public hearing need be held. Notice shall be given as prescribed in Chapter 18.36, Administration. The notice shall be mailed at least ten days before a decision is reached by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall review the application and the drawings and other documents submitted therewith, and shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposed use and the proposed conditions under which the use would be operated or maintained, particularly with respect to the findings prescribed in Section 18.26.050.

(2)  With the proposed use, the mix of businesses in any neighborhood shopping center, as classified in the general plan, will continue to service the day-by-day living needs of the immediate neighborhood; 
(3)  With the proposed use, financial institutions and offices will remain subordinate in area, extent and purpose to retail uses; 
(4)  The use will not increase the incidence of loitering, vandalism, pedestrian obstruction, excessive noise or any other activity that may have a significant and adverse effect on adjacent properties, or properties in the vicinity. 
(c)  The planning commission may grant an application for a use permit for commercial amusement devices (three or more) if it makes the additional finding that the use will not increase the incidence of loitering, vandalism, pedestrian obstruction, excessive noise or any other activity that may have a significant and adverse effect on adjacent properties, or properties in the vicinity.

(2)  As determined through an independent transportation analysis, the drive-through lane provides adequate on-site capacity and length to meet the anticipated demand for the drive-through lane on the site. 
(3)  The proposed restaurant does not have substantially the same design as the same restaurant in another location. 
(4)  The restaurant with drive-through will not significantly increase vehicular circulation through or immediately adjacent to residential neighborhoods located within the vicinity of the project site.

Chapter 18.30 - DESIGN REVIEW 
Sections: 

18.30.010 - Purposes. 
    The procedures and authority for review and approval of site plans, architectural elevations of buildings or other structures, signs and landscape plans are established by this chapter to achieve the following purposes: 
(1)  To ensure that new development and/or the alteration or enlargement of existing development occurs in a manner which is consistent with the policies of the general plan; 
(2)  To preserve the natural beauty of the town's site and setting; to prevent the indiscriminate clearing of property, and the destruction of trees and natural vegetation and the excessive and unsightly grading of hillsides; and to preserve natural landforms and ridgelines; 
(3)  To ensure that the location and configuration of structures are visually harmonious with their sites and with surrounding sites and structures; do not unnecessarily block scenic views from other buildings or tend to dominate the townscape or the natural landscape; and create an internal sense of order and provide a desirable environment for occupants, visitors and the general community. To this end, horizontal expansion is preferred over vertical when remodeling; 
(4)  To ensure that the architectural design of structures and their materials and colors are visually harmonious with surrounding development, natural landforms and vegetation; are appropriate to the function of the project; and promote harmonious transitions between different land uses; 
(5)  To ensure that new development is compatible with future development both on and off the site; 
(6)  To ensure that plans for the landscaping of open spaces conform with the requirements of this title, and that they provide visually pleasing settings for structures on the site and on adjoining and nearby sites, blend harmoniously with the natural landscape, and are appropriate to the design and function of the structures; 
(7)  To ensure that the design and location of signs and their material and colors are consistent with the character and scale of the buildings to which they are attached or which are located on the same site, and to ensure that signs are visually harmonious with surrounding development; 
(8)  To encourage the maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement of existing buildings and structures, and to encourage the conformance of all signs with this title; 
(9)  To ensure that access to the property and circulation thereon are safe and convenient for pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.30.020 - Scope of design review. 
    Where design review is prescribed for a use or structure by the district regulations, review and approval shall be directed to the following considerations: 
(1)  The proposed location of the structure on its site in relation to the location of buildings on adjoining sites, with particular attention to view considerations, privacy, and topographic or other constraints on development imposed by particular site conditions; 
(2)  The extent to which the site plan attains the minimum amount of grading and/or removal of trees and vegetation in creating a building site, including access drives and off-street parking areas; 
(3)  The size or bulk of the proposed building in relation to the character of existing buildings in the vicinity; 
(4)  Details of the proposed site plan, architectural and landscaping treatment, to ensure that, while originality in site planning, architecture, landscaping, and graphic design is not suppressed, inharmonious or monotonous design is avoided. Review shall include exterior design, materials, texture, colors, illuminations, signing, and landscaping, but need not consider elements of the design that are not visible beyond the boundaries of the site; 
(5)  Improvements to existing buildings and site features on the same site; 
(6)  Details of design required to achieve the purpose of this title; 
    Design review of single-family homes shall emphasize those aspects of the design that affect surrounding residents or the visual character of the town. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.30.030 - Guidelines. 
    The planning commission and zoning administrator shall be guided by the recommendations contained in any report or a visual analysis that may have been submitted in connection with a preliminary development plan or a precise development plan in accord with the provisions of Chapter 18.18, Special Purpose Overlay Districts, and by the following criteria: 
(1)  In all residential districts, single-story design is encouraged. 
(2)  In all areas of the town, the natural landform, including topography and vegetation, should be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Natural, high-quality materials and muted, earth tone colors are recommended. Other materials and colors may be permitted if the applicant demonstrates that they are appropriate to the design or architectural style of the building, harmonious with the site, and compatible with existing developments in the vicinity. Every effort should be made to retain trees with trunk diameters of four inches or more at ground level. Grading should be minimized. All exposed cut and fill slopes are required to be revegetated. Structures and decks should be stepped into the hillside wherever feasible. The width of streets and access drives should be kept to the minimum commensurate with traffic safety. Wherever possible, off-street parking should be located where its appearance is subordinate to the main structure. 
(3)  In bay front or water-oriented residential areas, preservation of view corridors to the bay should be attained wherever possible by cluster development or by combining side yards on one side of a building. 
(4)  On exposed, grassy hillsides, building designs are encouraged which have the long dimension of the building generally following the natural contours of the site. Clusters of buildings and occasional two-story buildings are encouraged to avoid the monotony of regularly spaced buildings and buildings of uniform height on a visible slope. 
(5)  On wooded slopes other than ridgetops, architectural design is encouraged which preserves the natural topography, vegetative cover, and significant landmarks and trees. 
(6)  Landscaping should feature native, low-maintenance and low-water-using varieties of trees, shrubs and groundcovers. 
(7)  New utilities shall be placed underground. 
(8)  For a senior housing development considered for a density bonus, the site should be reviewed for the following: proximity to neighborhood services, i.e., public transit, grocery stores, banks, medical services, pharmacy and other convenience needs, churches, etc.; compatibility of the proposed development with the character of the surrounding neighborhood; the ambient noise level should be appropriate for residential uses; ingress and egress should be safe; the parking area should not exceed a five percent slope, have adequate lighting, curb cuts and ramps; provision of a convenient, covered, passenger loading zone located out of the traffic flow; pedestrian routes should be well-lighted; resting spots, such as benches or low retaining walls, situated near walkways; the units shall be specifically designed to meet handicapped accessibility requirements of state and federal laws.

    Routine maintenance and repairs may be performed on a structure or site, the use of which is nonconforming, and on a nonconforming structure. 
(Ord. 785 § 3(b) (part), 1994) 
18.32.030 - Alterations and additions to nonconforming uses. 
    No structure, the use of which is nonconforming, shall be moved, altered or enlarged unless required by law, or unless the moving, alteration or enlargement will result in the elimination of the nonconforming use, except a residential use in a commercial zone may be moved, altered or enlarged without need for a conditional use permit. 
    No structure partially occupied by a nonconforming use shall be moved, altered or enlarged in such a way as to permit the enlargement of the space occupied by the nonconforming use. 
    No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or extended in such a way as to occupy any part of the structure or site or another structure or site which it did not occupy on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title or of the amendment thereto which caused it to become a nonconforming use, or in such a way as to displace any conforming use occupying a structure or site.

The entire private sewer lateral, from the building connection to and including the "wye" connection or other-tie-in to the sewer main, shall fall within the owner's responsibility for installation, maintenance and repair. 
(b)  Owners must clean, maintain and repair sewer laterals serving their property sufficient to keep the sewer lateral in operable condition at all times. The owner shall perform such duties as may be required in response to observed overflows or seepage attributable to the lateral, or as discovered by smoke testing, televising, pressure testing or other surveys of the lateral. Where such maintenance requires excavation and/or replacement of existing facilities, the owner shall apply for and receive a connection permit (21.28.005) from the district. 
( Ord. No. 45, § 3, 6-4-2018 ) 
21.20.006 - [Shared sewer laterals.] 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the district to require one private sewer lateral serving one single family home. However, the district is cognizant that portions of the sewer service system within the district are very old with multiple hillside single-family homes being historically serviced by one private sewer lateral (e.g., one private sewer lateral for two or more homes). Where no apparent deficiency exists with a shared sewer lateral, the district shall allow the shared sewer lateral. Where repairs are necessary, the owners of the residences served by the shared lateral shall jointly be responsible for the repairs. Where repairs and/or replacement of such a shared lateral is necessary, the district may require the construction of a new private sewer lateral for each residential single-family home or the construction of a new larger private sewer lateral to accommodate the residences that share the sewer lateral. 
(b)  The District encourages owners of shared sewer laterals to enter into a maintenance agreement between all of the owners sharing the private lateral to ensure that there is a mechanism in place to pay for required repairs and/or replacement of the private sewer lateral. In general terms, a common method is to proportion the costs of the maintenance, repair or replacement among the owners sharing the lateral. For example, owners upstream of the shared lateral section requiring rehabilitation would proportion their costs relative to the length of the shared lateral which serves their home divided by the length of the entire shared lateral from the sewer main upstream to the point of the repair. The relative percentage may vary along the pipe depending on the number of connections upstream of the repair. Owners that are part of a shared lateral connection not otherwise in violation of this title are not subject to the transfer of property title requirement (21.22.020 (b)). 
( Ord. No. 45, § 3, 6-4-2018 ) 
21.20.010 - Separate sewers. 
    No two adjacent buildings fronting on the same street shall be permitted to join in the use of the same lateral sewer. Every building or commercial facility must be separately connected to a main sewer if such main sewer exists in the street upon which the property abuts or in an easement which will serve said property. However, one or more buildings located on property belonging to the same owner may be served with the same lateral sewer during the period of said ownership. Upon the subsequent subdivision and sale of a portion of said lot the portion not directly connected with such main sewer shall be separately connected with a main sewer, and it is unlawful for the owner thereof to continue to use or maintain such indirect connection. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.020 - Connection to district sewer system. 
    The connection of any sewer into the district sewer system shall be made in strict accordance with "Standard Specifications and Drawings, Sanitary District No. 2 of Marin County" or similar guidelines that may be established by or for the district and at the applicant's expense. The connection to the district sewer system shall be made in the presence of district staff and under its supervision and direction. Any damage to the district sewer shall be repaired at the cost of the applicant to the satisfaction of district staff. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.030 - Cleanouts. 
    Cleanouts shall be required on all existing and new sewer laterals. The type and installation requirements shall be as set forth in the district's standard specifications and drawings. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.040 - Backflow prevention devices. 
    Backflow prevention devices shall be required on all existing and new laterals. The type and installation requirements shall be as set forth in the district's standard specifications and drawings. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.050 - Sewer too low. 
    In all buildings in which any sewer is too low to permit gravity flow to the main sewer, as defined by the minimum slopes established in the district's standard specifications and drawings, sanitary sewage carried by such sewer shall be lifted by artificial means, approved by district staff, and discharged to the main sewer at the expense of the owner. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.060 - Maintenance. 
    The owner of the property served by any lateral or other type of sewer which is connected either directly or indirectly to a district main sewer shall have sole ownership and maintenance responsibilities for that sewer and its connection to the main, and shall abide by all of the rules and regulations of the district in maintaining, improving, repairing or replacing the sewer serving the owner's property. The lateral and appurtenances shall be kept pressure tight and in good working order at all times. All laterals, regardless of their age, are required to meet the general and technical requirements detailed in the latest edition of the district's standard specifications and drawings. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.070 - Testing and right of entry. 
    District staff or their representatives shall be permitted to enter the property for the purpose of testing and inspecting the private sewer laterals and appurtenances at any time. Testing shall be in accordance with the district's standard specifications and drawings. If found to be defective, the owner shall, within ninety days of a notice of said defects, apply for a permit for the repair or replacement of the lateral and/or appurtenances. 
    Should the lateral and appurtenances pass the test, the cost of such testing will be paid for by the district. Should the system fail the test, the cost of such testing will be added to the permitting costs for the repairs or replacement of the lateral. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.075 - Access to properties for sewer lateral inspection. 
    The District Manager (or any designated representative thereof) is hereby authorized to inspect private sewer laterals with advance notice to the owner for the following purposes: 
(a)  To determine the size, depth, and location of any sewer connection. 
(b)  To determine the end outlet of any sewer connection by depositing harmless testing materials in any plumbing fixture attached thereto and flushing the same, if necessary. 
(c)  To determine, by measurements and samples, the quantity and nature of the sewage or wastewater being discharged. 
(d)  To determine the location of the roof, swimming pool, floor and surface drains, and whether or not they physically connect to a sewer. 
(e)  To assess the condition of the lateral where he/she suspects that the lateral may be allowing inflow or infiltration. 
    Nothing herein shall be deemed to provide the District Manager with any right or authority to enter a building or other apparently private or interior area of a real property, except to the extent such entry is expressly authorized by state law, a public emergency or by consent or permission of the resident. 
( Ord. No. 45, § 3, 6-4-2018 ) 
21.20.080 - Mandatory testing. 
    Mandatory testing of sewer laterals and appurtenances shall be required as follows: 
(a)  For existing lateral sewers serving a new building, the existing lateral may only be used when it is found, upon examination and testing by district staff, to meet all requirements of the district. 
(b)  For existing lateral sewers serving a newly remodeled building, when the remodeling increases the number of plumbing fixture units by ten percent or more, the existing lateral may only be used when it is found, upon examination and testing by district staff, to meet all requirements of the district. 
    Whenever testing shall be conducted in accordance with this section, the cost of the testing shall be paid for by the owner and performed in the presence of district staff. Testing shall be in accordance with the district's standard specifications and drawings. If found to be defective, the owner shall, within ninety days of a notice of said defects, apply for a permit for the repair or replacement of the lateral and/or appurtenances. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.090 - Permit required. 
    In accordance with Chapter 21.28 of this title, no person shall construct a sewer lateral or make a connection to the sewer main without first obtaining a written permit from the district and paying all fees and connection charges as required therein. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.20.100 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 45 , § 1, adopted June 4, 2018, repealed § 21.20.100, which pertained to Inspection and correction of inflow and infiltration in lateral sewers and derived from San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002. 
Chapter 21.22 - INFILTRATION AND INFLOW; INSPECTIONS; REPAIRS 
Sections: 

21.22.010 - Findings. 
(a)  For the reasons stated below, the district finds and determines Infiltration and Inflow (hereinafter referred to as I & I) into the sewer system to be a concern for the district that requires inspections and repairs required in this title. During heavy rains a significant amount of storm water is introduced into the district's sanitary system as a result of I & I from breaches in the entire pipeline system which includes private sewer laterals that lead to the pump stations and Central Marin Sanitation Agency (hereinafter referred to as CMSA) treatment plant. To a great extent, much of this I & I is introduced into the district's pipelines and sewer mains from the private sewer laterals or unpermitted drainage structures leading from a property to the district's sewer mains. As a result of I & I, the CMSA sewer treatment facilities have the potential to become overburdened during periods of heavy rains leading to sewage overflows or bypass and possible spills into the San Francisco Bay waters. Such overflows and spills can lead not only to significant fines and penalties against the CMSA Treatment Plant and District by regional state and federal water regulatory agencies, but may pose a significant risk to the environment, and the health and safety of the public at large. The District has determined that it is in the public interest to address I & I and sewer overflows contributed by private sewer lateral s and, as such, it is a District priority to authorize and mandate the enforcement of the upgrade, replacement or repair of private sewer laterals as required in this title including as a condition of building permits, construction work and property sales. 
(b)  The District also finds that inflow and infiltration from the lateral sewers of property owners has caused the district sewer system to back up, leak, malfunction, and operate at a lower efficiency and capacity than the system is intended and designed to do. Further, the district finds that these problems have resulted in the district paying considerable extra expense annually in order to continue the operations of its sewage pump stations. The District also finds that this inflow and infiltration into the district sewer system is caused by the age and wear and tear to sewer laterals that have existed for many years without being tested, replaced and/or repaired. The district hereby establishes in this section a voluntary sewer lateral replacement program to address the problems associated with inflow and infiltration in lateral sewers throughout the district. 
(c)  During each fiscal year and until the need shall no longer arise, the district board or staff may in its sole and unfettered discretion offer to owners served by the district sewer system the option of executing an agreement with the district to test for inflow and infiltration and repair or replace the owner's lateral sewer cost and expense of the district in exchange for the owner's agreement to retain ownership and maintenance responsibility over the private sewer lateral after the district completes the repair or replacement of the lateral sewer. The agreement shall release, hold harmless and indemnification provisions in favor of the district and shall be in a form provided by district staff. 
(d)  The District shall not be required by this section to offer any owner being served by the district the opportunity to participate in the program described in this section. The District board or staff shall determine which properties, if any, are to be offered participation in this program based upon the availability of District resources, the needs of the property owners, and any other factors that it may deem relevant to its decision. Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, no person shall have the right to appeal any decision or determination made by the district under this section. 
(e)  The District shall test the lateral sewer for inflow and infiltration according to the "Standard Specifications and Drawings, Sanitary District No. 2 of Marin County" or similar guidelines that may be established by or for the district. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall alter or modify the owner's maintenance, repair and ownership responsibilities over the lateral sewer as set forth in Section 21.20.060. 
( Ord. No. 45, § 4, 6-4-2018 ) 
21.22.020 - Mandatory inspections. 
(a)  Health and safety basis for requiring a private sewer lateral inspection. An owner of any private sewer lateral serving owner's residential property, fixed and floating property, commercial property, publicly owned building, common interest development, apartment building and any other structure which has a private sewer lateral shall have the sewer lateral inspected in accordance with the requirements of this chapter (as directed and within the time period indicated by the district Manager) upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
(1)  Overflow or malfunction. Whenever District staff determines that the private sewer lateral has recently overflowed or has recently malfunctioned; 
(2)  Lateral failure or lack of maintenance. Whenever District staff finds that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the private sewer lateral has failed, is likely to fail, or has not been properly maintained. 
(3)  Public health threat. Upon any other reasonable cause to believe that there is a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare due to the condition of a private sewer lateral. 
(4)  Age of pipes and/or extent flora causing higher flow within the service area. Whenever the District Manager determines that the age of pipes (clay, plastic or other material) in combination with observed flora (tree roots near the sewer lateral suggesting root intrusion causing infiltration) or the age of the pipes independently are causing excessive flow in a neighborhood or area, the District Manager may direct an inspection of the private sewer lateral to determine the need for repair. 
(b)  Events requiring a sewer service lateral inspection. 
    All properties. An owner shall have the private sewer lateral serving his or her property inspected and all defects repaired in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the district standard specifications upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
(1)  Additions and improvements. Prior to the issuance of a county or city building permit for a building addition or new improvements on the real property where said addition or improvements (or cumulative additions or improvements through multiple projects over the prior three years) have a value of fifty thousand dollars or greater (second units, additions, water meter change size or fire sprinkler installed, fixture counts change, or District Manager request). 
i.  District shall notify the relevant jurisdiction (Town, City or County) of this requirement so that issuance of a building permit is conditioned upon meeting the requirement of a lateral inspection. 
(2)  Transfer of property title. Where the sale of any real property with sewer improvements is proposed, the seller shall have the private sewer lateral inspected prior to transfer of property title, including transfers made by a trust or other mechanism within the same family. 
i.  It is suggested that the seller provide an inspection report of the private sewer lateral as specified in 21.20.030 to District Staff upon offering the home for sale. The responsibility for any repair of a lateral is an issue between the buyer and seller. Regardless of who is responsible for the private sewer lateral repair, such repair shall be completed within one hundred eighty days of the close of sale. 
ii.  Should the seller fail to have an inspection conducted on the property prior to the sale of the property, the district shall require the new owner to conduct an inspection and make any necessary repairs to the lateral. 
(3)  Whenever the district is replacing a sewer main or conducting repair of a sewer main or the town of Corte Madera or County of Marin is resurfacing roads on or near the road where the private sewer lateral connects to the sewer main, owners will be notified by the district of the current work and need for an inspection report on their private sewer lateral prior to the road work or construction so that any remedial work to the lateral is completed prior to completion of the construction or road work. Sanitary District Capital Improvements Projects may necessitate the repair or replacement of portion or the entire private sewer lateral at the District Manager's discretion at which time the requirement in this subsection may be waived by the District Manager. Any private sewer lateral repaired or replaced by the district shall remain the responsibility of the property owner as described in 21.20.060. 
(4)  Where an owner refuses to provide an inspection, District may conduct a televised inspection or pressure test and the owner shall be responsible for the costs of such inspection. Should an inspection reveal the need for repairs, the district may issue a notice to repair to the owner and have the remedies provided for in 21.040(d) of this title to ensure repairs are made and costs are paid by the owner. 
(5)  Exception to inspection for recent prior inspections and replacements. The following are exceptions to the inspection requirements of this subparagraph b). The following exceptions do not apply to any inspection required under subparagraph a) above. 
i.  Prior Replacement of Sewer Lateral. An owner otherwise required to perform a private sewer lateral inspection under this subsection shall not be required to perform such an inspection if the owner (or the owner's predecessor-in-interest) has originally installed or has replaced his or her property's entire private sewer lateral within the three years prior to the date of the application for a building permit, listing the property for sale, or the road work or sewer repair, unless reasonable cause is made apparent to District staff that the new lateral is compromised. 
ii.  Prior Inspection and Repair of a Sewer Lateral. An owner otherwise required to perform an inspection under this subsection (b) shall not be required to perform such an inspection if the owner has either completed a remedial inspection (conducted in accordance with the inspection requirements of this title and completed a permitted repair of the sewer lateral within the three years prior to the date the inspection would otherwise be required. 
iii.  Proof of Prior Replacement of a Sewer Lateral. Owner shall provide proof of any prior replacement of a private sewer lateral ten years or less in age and approved by the District Manager in the form of a certificate, a paid bill or any sufficient documentation that ensures such prior replacement of a private sewer lateral occurred pursuant to subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) above. The form and content of the document or proof must be deemed sufficient by the district or its designated representative. 
iv.  Shared Portions of Laterals may apply for a onetime 180-day extension to assist owners' time to schedule needed repairs or replacement. 
v.  Homeowners' Associations (H.O.A.'s) may apply for a three-year blanket approval if a lateral or laterals in the condominium complex are inspected at one time, and approved in accordance with this title by the district.

(a)  Notice to repair. Upon receipt of the Sewer Lateral Inspection Report pursuant to this title, the District Manager (or designated staff) will determine whether it indicates any deficiencies in the operation of the private sewer lateral and if it does, the District Manager shall provide the owner(s) with a notice to repair as may be deemed appropriate by District staff. District staff shall provide the determination and issue a notice to repair within fifteen business days after receipt of the inspection report. The notice to repair/replace shall specifically identify the deficiencies to be corrected and shall establish a deadline of one hundred eighty days, within which the owner(s) shall complete the required corrective actions at owners' expensive. The corrective action may include a requirement that the lateral be replaced altogether and also may include the installation of cleanouts and backwater valves if those devices are otherwise required by this title or any uniform code adopted by the district. 
(b)  Obligations of the owner. The owner shall repair his or her private sewer lateral to the satisfaction of the District Manager, and, if a building permit is required for the repairs, the owner shall obtain a final permit inspection and approval of the relevant Building Official. 
(c)  Repairs to improper connections consisting of multiple private connections to a common lateral. A private sewer lateral serving more than one residential dwelling, except as provided for in 21.20.006, is an improper connection and shall be repaired or replaced as deemed appropriate by the District Manager. The owner of each affected premises shall be responsible for disconnecting their private sewer lateral from the common lateral and connecting to the nearest sewer main. 
(d)  Failure to repair upon district notification. Should an owner fail to conduct the required repairs upon issuance of a Notice to Repair by the district, the district shall have several options in order to ensure that the repair or replacement is completed: 
(1)  Public nuisance: Continued habitation of any home, building or continued operation of any industrial facility in violation of a notice to repair or replace a private sewer lateral is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. The district may cause proceedings to be brought for the abatement of the occupancy of the home, building or industrial facility (i.e., a court order directing the occupant(s) to vacate the home, building or industrial facility until the directed repairs are made) during the period of such violation. The district shall have the right to recover its attorney fees and costs for the pursuit of the abatement. 
(2)  Disconnection of private sewer lateral to sewer main. The district shall have the right to commence proceedings in Marin Superior Court to seek a court order disconnecting the private sewer lateral from the sewer main, thus leaving the home, building or industrial facility without municipal sewer service. The district shall have the right to recover its attorney fees and costs for the pursuit of disconnection. 
(3)  Corrections of violations: Section 6523 of the California Health and Safety Code provides than in order to enforce the provisions of any ordinance of a district, the district may correct any violation of an ordinance of the district.

(d)  Hotel or Motel. 0.25 sewer user units shall be assigned to each guest room or suite contained in a hotel or motel. 
(e)  A residential apartment shall be assigned the number of sewer user units that is the greater of the following calculations: 
(1)  The percentage of occupancy of the residential apartment multiplied by the number of rooms available to rent on December 31 of the applicable year; or 
(2)  The winter consumption units for the residential apartment reported by the Marin Municipal Water District during the winter of the applicable year multiplied by .05 (i.e., bimonthly water consumption reading multiplied by 100 divided by 2 divided by 1,000). 
    As used in this subsection "percentage of occupancy" shall be determined by applying the following three-step formula: 
(1)  Multiply the number of rooms that were actually rented in the residential apartment throughout the applicable calendar year by 365; 
(2)  Multiply the number of rooms available for rent in the residential apartment on December 31 of the applicable year by 365; 
(3)  Divide the answer in the first step by the answer in the second step. This number is the percentage of occupancy. 
(f)  Nonresidential Premises. For premises other than dwelling units, sewer user units shall be assigned based on the sewage discharge and strength of the premise. The winter water use for each nonresidential user shall be divided by one thousand cubic feet per month, which is deemed to be the average winter season residential use for the base year, to determine the sewer user units to be assigned. Sewer user units as calculated above shall be rounded to the nearest integer (not less than one). 
(g)  Base Year Water Consumption. Sewer user unit assignments are based on the latest winter season water consumption records available at the time of the first adoption of the ordinance codified in this section and may be revised from time to time. Water consumption by nonresidential users shall be adjusted upon request of the user, according to the decision of district staff, if a significant portion of the base year water consumption was used for irrigation flows and other flows not discharging to the sewerage system. 
(h)  High Strength Sewage. For certain nonresidential premises which discharge sewage having significantly greater strength characteristics as measured by concentration of solids or biological oxygen demand than residential sewage, the total sewer user unit assignment shall be determined by multiplying the units determined in subsection (f) by the strength factor shown. 
User Strength Factor Markets with garbage disposal 2.34 Mortuaries 2.34 Restaurants 2.34 Bakeries 2.34 High strength users with grease interceptor equipment 2.00  
For other users, if any, discharging high strength sewage, the strength factor shall be as determined by district staff. 
(i)  Inquiry Regarding Assignment of Sewer User Units and Strength Factors. Questions or inquiries regarding the assignment of sewer user units, adjustments therein for irrigation flows or other flows not discharging to the sewerage system and strength factors must be submitted to the district in writing before changes in unit assignment will be made. District staff shall have the authority to make appropriate adjustments in sewer user units and strength factors assigned based on factual data supplied by the user or obtained independently by district staff.

(3)  Divide the answer in the first step by the answer in the second step. This number is the percentage of occupancy. 
(f)  Nonresidential Premises. For premises other than dwelling units, sewer user units shall be assigned based on the sewage discharge and strength of the premise. The winter water use for each nonresidential user shall be divided by one thousand cubic feet per month, which is deemed to be the average winter season residential use for the base year, to determine the sewer user units to be assigned. Sewer user units as calculated above shall be rounded to the nearest integer (not less than one). 
(g)  Base Year Water Consumption. Sewer user unit assignments are based on the latest winter season water consumption records available at the time of the first adoption of the ordinance codified in this section and may be revised from time to time. Water consumption by nonresidential users shall be adjusted upon request of the user, according to the decision of district staff, if a significant portion of the base year water consumption was used for irrigation flows and other flows not discharging to the sewerage system. 
(h)  High Strength Sewage. For certain nonresidential premises which discharge sewage having significantly greater strength characteristics as measured by concentration of solids or biological oxygen demand than residential sewage, the total sewer user unit assignment shall be determined by multiplying the units determined in subsection (f) by the strength factor shown. 
User Strength Factor Markets with garbage disposal 2.34 Mortuaries 2.34 Restaurants 2.34 Bakeries 2.34 High strength users with grease interceptor equipment 2.00  
    For other users, if any, discharging high strength sewage, the strength factor shall be as determined by district staff. 
(i)  Inquiry Regarding Assignment of Sewer User Units and Strength Factors. Questions or inquiries regarding the assignment of sewer user units, adjustments therein for irrigation flows or other flows not discharging to the sewerage system and strength factors must be submitted to the district in writing before changes in unit assignment will be made. District staff shall have the authority to make appropriate adjustments in sewer user units and strength factors assigned based on factual data supplied by the user or obtained independently by district staff. 
(j)  Any decision of district staff made under this section may be appealed in accordance with this title. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.40.060 - Sewer user service charge-Properties not included on the county property tax roll. 
    For all properties that are connected to the district sewer system which are not included on the county of Marin property tax roll, the property owner shall be directly billed by the district on or after February 1st of each year for the annual sewer user service charge and related fees in the amount set by the board of directors. Said charges and fees billed by the district shall be payable in one lump sum directly to the district and become due ninety days after the date of the billing. A twelve percent per annum rate of interest shall apply to any delinquent balance of charges and/or related fees. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.40.070 - Collection and penalty. 
    The sewer user service charge shall be collected by the county tax collector and shall constitute a lien against the property as described in Section 5473 of the Health and Safety Code of the State of California. Payments of sewer user service charges not made by the dates general property taxes are due shall be subject to a basic penalty of ten percent of the unpaid amount plus one and one-half of one percent per month of the unpaid amount plus basic penalty in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 5473.10. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.40.080 - Person responsible for payment. 
    The person responsible for payment of all charges under this chapter shall be the owner of the property being served. 
(San. Dist. No. 2 Ord. 34 § 2 (part), 2002) 
21.40.090 - Low flow sewer user. 
    District staff may adjust the sewer user service charge for a sewer user who can demonstrate to the district that special circumstances exist which indicate that wastewater volume discharged into the district sewer system is lower than what the average sewer user discharges. Special circumstances can be demonstrated by showing that the sewer user's winter water consumption is significantly lower than the winter water consumption for the average user in the district.
