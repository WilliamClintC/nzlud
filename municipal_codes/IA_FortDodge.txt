FORT DODGE, IOWA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Fort Dodge, Iowa 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 6, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Fort Dodge Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 6, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2294, passed November 26, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 6, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 6, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

    An employer, employment agency, or their employees, servants, or agents may offer employment or advertise for employment to only persons with disabilities, when other applicants have available to them other employment compatible with their ability which would not be available to persons with disabilities because of their disabilities. Any such employment or offer of employment shall not discriminate among persons with disabilities on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. 
(b)  The following age provisions not applicable to retirement programs: 
(1)  The provisions of this chapter relating to discrimination because of age shall not be construed to apply to any retirement plan or benefit system of any employer unless such plan or system is a mere subterfuge adopted for the purpose of evading the provisions of this chapter.

(c)  Employment policies relating to pregnancy and childbirth shall be governed by the following: 
(1)  A written or unwritten employment policy or practice which excludes from employment applicants or employees because of the employee's pregnancy is a prima facie violation of this chapter. 
(2)  Disabilities caused or contributed to by the employee's pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment. Written and unwritten employment policies and practices involving matters such as the commencement and duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority and other benefits and privileges, reinstatement, and payment under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan, formal or informal, shall be applied to a disability due to the employee's pregnancy or giving birth, on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities.

(5)  Where a leave is not available or a sufficient leave is not available under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment, the employer of the pregnant employee shall not refuse to grant to the employee who is disabled by the pregnancy a leave of absence if the leave of absence is for the period that the employee is disabled because of the employee's pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition or for eight weeks, whichever is less. However, the employee must provide timely notice of the period of leave requested and the employer must, approve any change in the period requested before the change is effective. Before granting the leave of absence, the employer may require that the employee's disability resulting from pregnancy be verified by medical certification stating that the employee is not able to reasonably perform the duties of employment. 
(d)  This section shall not prohibit discrimination on the basis of age if the person subject to the discrimination is under the age of eighteen years, unless that person is considered by law to be an adult. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a state or federal program designed to benefit a specific age classification which serves a bona fide public purpose shall be permissible.

(1)  The employment of individuals for work within the home of the employer if the employer or members of the employer's family reside therein during such employment. 
(2)  The employment of individuals to render personal service to the person of the employer or members of the employer's family.

Any employer, employment agency, or their employees, servants or agents may offer employment or advertise for employment to only the disabled, when other applicants have available to them other employment compatible with their ability which would not be available to the disabled because of their handicap. Any such employment or offer of employment shall not discriminate among the disabled on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, religion, national origin or age.

The director shall promptly furnish the respondent with a notice of charge and a copy of the complaint must be filed within three hundred days after notification of the alleged discriminatory practice. A complaint filed with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission under the provisions of the Iowa Civil Rights Act shall be sufficient for the purposes of this chapter, if it alleges discriminatory acts within the corporate limits of Fort Dodge. 
(b)  A member of the commission staff or one or more members of the commission, as appointed by the chairperson shall constitute the investigating committee. It shall be the purpose of the investigating committee to promptly investigate the allegations of discriminatory practice set forth in the complaint. 
(c)  At the outset of any investigation, the investigating committee may approach the respondent with mediation proposals which would encourage the administrative closing of the case. 
(d)  The investigating committee may recommend to the commission that the complaint be administratively closed because there is no useful purpose that would be served by further action by the commission respecting a complaint, such as: 
(1)  The commission staff has not been successful in locating a complainant after diligent efforts; 
(2)  The respondent has gone out of business; 
(3)  A right to sue letter has been issued; 
(4)  After a probable cause decision has been made, it is determined that the record does not justify proceeding to public hearing; 
(5)  A satisfactorily adjustment has been made that was agreeable to the investigating committee, but not to the complainant; and 
(6)  The complainant has indicated in writing the desire that no further action be taken by the commission regarding the complaint. 
(e)  The investigating committee shall take the testimony of the complainant, respondent, witnesses, and such other evidence as it deems relevant. The investigating committee shall present the evidence to the commission and make a recommendation to the commission as to whether there is probable cause to believe a discriminatory practice has been committed. At any time during the investigative procedures and prior to a vote by the commission on probable cause, a respondent may request mediation, which, after commission approval would allow for the administrative closing of the case. 
(f)  If it is determined after investigation that no probable cause exists for such complaint, the commission shall forthwith notify the complainant and respondent. The notification to the complainant shall state that there has been a no probable cause finding and that the complainant has twenty days to petition to reopen the case. The respondent shall be notified that the complainant has the right to petition to reopen the case listing the time limitation. 
(g)  The respondent shall be notified immediately if the complainant does petition to reopen, along with a copy of the petition. The respondent shall then have twenty days to resist the petition. Failure to resist shall not obligate the commission to reopen if inadequate grounds to reopen are alleged. 
(h)  If it is determined after investigation that probable cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint, the commission staff shall promptly proceed with conciliation. 
(i)  The commission shall notify the Iowa Civil Rights Commission whenever a finding of probable cause or no probable cause has been made with respect to any case within their jurisdiction or whenever such case is otherwise closed. 
(j)  The complaint may be amended at any time prior to the scheduling of the complaint for a public hearing, and thereafter, only upon the consent of the person(s) conducting the hearing. Such leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. 
(Ord. 1801 § 14, 1991). 
(Ord. No. 2101, 10-13-08) 
2.16.150 - Conciliation. 
(a)  After a finding of probable cause, the respondent shall be promptly notified in writing of the finding and shall be informed of his/her right to conciliate. 
(b)  Where the conciliation results in an agreement between the respondent and the commission, the agreement shall be in writing and shall be signed by the respondent or his/her representatives and by the director of the commission. The director shall consult with the complainant prior to signing the agreement, and should the complainant object to the agreement it must be presented to the commission for its approval before the agreement may be signed. The complainant shall be given an opportunity to state the reasons for dissatisfaction to the commission. 
(c)  If, after attempts to conciliate, the person or persons directed to conciliate shall find that conciliation efforts have failed, such failure shall be reported in writing to the commission. If the commission determines the charge to be well founded, it will promptly schedule the matter for public hearing. If the commission determines the charge not to be well founded, it shall declare the case closed and shall so notify the Iowa Civil Rights Commission of the failure of conciliation efforts and of the action taken. 
(Ord. 1801 § 15, 1991). 
2.16.160 - Public hearing. 
(a)  After the commission had voted to take a complaint to public hearing, the commission shall serve on the respondent by registered or certified mail a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint as it may have been amended, requiring the respondent to answer the allegations of the complaint at a public hearing. The hearing shall be held not less than twenty days but not more than sixty days after the commission has voted to take the complaint to public hearing.

(d)  No person shall take part in the conducting of the hearing who has any personal interests in its outcome or who has taken part in the investigation of the complaint. No commissioner who would be disqualified under the above criteria shall take part in any vote or discussion by the commission respecting the complaint. 
(e)  If a party fails to appear in a contested case proceeding after proper service of notice, the person(s) conducting the hearing may proceed and make a decision in the absence of the party. 
(f)  Opportunity shall be afforded all parties to respond and present evidence and argument on all issues involved and to be represented by counsel at their own expense. The case for the commission may be presented by any member of the commission staff, an attorney from the city or county attorney's office, or an attorney of the complainant's choice. The hearing need not be bound by the strict rules of evidence, but the admission of evidence should be based on sound discretion.

(2)  All evidence received or considered and all other submissions; 
(3)  A statement of all matters officially noticed;

(k)  If the decision under subsection (j) of this section is made by a hearing officer, the commission shall vote as to whether to adopt, modify or overrule the written findings and proposed remedies. Their decision shall be by a majority of those present and voting. Thereupon, the commission shall issue a ruling, either incorporating the proposed findings and remedies as its own, or stating the commission's decision, including separate findings and remedy. Decisions shall be sent by certified mail to the parties of record. For the purposes of Section 2.16.180, the date of mailing shall be considered the date of the commission's decision. 
(Ord. 1801 § 16, 1991). 
2.16.170 - Judicial review-Enforcement.

(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-2013) 
13.24.280 - Reporting requirements for permittee. 
    The following reports are required for wastewater contribution permit holders: 
(1)  Compliance Date Report. Within ninety days following the effective date of an applicable pretreatment standard users subject to the pretreatment standards shall submit to the director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified professional. 
(2)  Periodic Compliance Reports. 
(A)  Any significant industrial user shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the director and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(B)  The director may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subdivision (A) of this subsection shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the approval authority pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the approval authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the approval authority. 
(3)  Categorical Pretreatment Standard-Baseline Report. Within ninety days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or ninety days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the treatment works shall be required to submit to the director a report which contains the information required under 40 CFR 403.12 (b)(1)-(7). Where reports containing this information already have been submitted to the state or EPA in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(5). 
New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4) and (5). 
(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-13) 
13.24.285 - Application signatories and certification. 
    All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user reports must contain the following certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direct supervision in accordance to a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-13) 
13.24.290 - Monitoring facilities. 
    All significant industrial users shall be required to provide and operate at their own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There will be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and all sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following written notification by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-13) 
13.24.295 - Testing methods. 
    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with methods specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and shall be determined at the monitoring facility provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said monitoring facility. In the event that no special monitoring facility has been required, the monitoring facility shall be considered to the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD, Ammonia Nitrogen (N), and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH and oil/grease are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-13) 
13.24.300 - Pretreatment.

Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained continuously and in satisfactory and effective operation at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facilities. Design and installation of such facilities shall be subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. The city shall annually publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the city a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance with pretreatment requirements or standards during the twelve previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same twelve months.

    No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. Special arrangements shall not be allowed which will cause violation of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-13) 
13.24.310 - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs. Wastewater monitoring results will not be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential will be provided to the state and EPA upon request without prior notification to the user.

Any person who continues any violation beyond the time limit provided for in such notice shall be guilty of a municipal infraction and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in the amount not exceeding one thousand dollars a day per violation. Each day in which any such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition thereto, any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the city by reason of such violation. In addition to the other remedies provided in this chapter, the city may, at the city's office, initiate an action, either in law or in equity, to obtain an injunction against further violations of this chapter, and for judgment for all costs incurred by the city occasioned by the user's violation of any requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2188, § II, 11-12-13) 
13.24.360 - Enforcement. 
(a)  Administrative Remedies. 
(1)  Notification of Violation. Whenever the city finds that any person has violated or is violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained therein, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation ("notice of violation"). Within thirty days of the date of the notice of violation, a plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation shall be submitted to the city by the person. Submission of this plan does not relieve the person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent Orders. The director is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar agreements with any person responsible for violation of, or noncompliance with, this chapter or a permit issued hereunder (hereafter referred to as noncompliance). Such orders shall specify action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period that shall be specified in the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection 13.24.360(a)(4) below. 
(3)  Show Cause Hearing. The director may order any user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, who has violated this chapter or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice that substantially notifies the user of the specific time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken shall be issued by the city ("show cause hearing notice"). The show cause hearing notice shall be served on the user at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The city shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and shall determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under Section 13.24.360(b). 
(4)  Administrative Orders. When the director, or his duly authorized representative, finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, the prohibitions or discharge limitations of this chapter, or those contained in any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, the director, or his duly authorized representative, may issue an order to cease and desist, and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(A)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(B)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(C)  Take appropriate remedial or preventative action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(D)  Disconnect from the POTW, or cease discharging into the POTW, unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(5)  Emergency Suspensions. The director, or his duly authorized representative, may suspend wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit when the director believes suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW, or causes the POTW to violate any conditions of its NPDES permit. Any user notified of a suspension of their wastewater treatment service and/or their wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. A hearing shall be held within fifteen days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's wastewater discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any person or property. The director shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge and the payment of all user charges, surcharges, penalties and other cost assessed hereunder. The user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director prior to the date of the above described hearing. 
(6)  Termination of Permit or Permission of Discharge. Any user who violates any condition of this chapter, or applicable state or federal regulations, is subject to having its permit terminated. The city may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(A)  Failure to factually and accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of the user's discharge; 
(B)  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(C)  Refusal to allow reasonable access to the user's premises to the director, approval authority, or EPA for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
(D)  Violation of conditions of the wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this chapter, or any applicable state or federal regulations. 
Noncompliant users shall be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater discharge permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under this subsection (13.24.360(a)) why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(b)  Civil Penalties. Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be assessed a civil penalty by the city up to twenty-five thousand dollars per day per violation. Penalties between ten thousand dollars and twenty-five thousand dollars per day per violation may be assessed against a violator only if: 
(1)  For any class of violation, only if a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within the five years preceding the violation, or 
(2)  In the case of failure to file, submit, or make available, as the case may be any documents, data, or reports required by this chapter, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, only if the city determines that the violation was intentional and a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator with the five years preceding the violation. 
Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charges and the POTW, in addition to all other remedies, shall have such remedies for the collection of such assessments as it has for collection of other service charges. 
(c)  Penalty Determination. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the city shall consider the following: 
(1)  The degree and extent of the harm to natural resources, the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the violation; 
(2)  The duration and gravity of the violation; 
(3)  The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on air quality; 
(4)  The cost of rectifying the damage; 
(5)  The amount of money the user saved by noncompliance; 
(6)  Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally; 
(7)  The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with the pretreatment program; 
(8)  Other fines and penalties assessed to user for previous violations; and 
(9)  The costs of enforcement to the city. 
(d)  Other Available Remedies. Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned in this chapter, are available to the city that may use any single one or combination thereof against a noncompliant person or user. Additional available remedies include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Criminal Violations. The district attorney for the 2 nd Judicial District (the judicial district encompassing Webster County) may, at the request of the city, prosecute noncompliant persons and users who violate the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the WWTP director, through the city attorney, may petition the county superior court for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent injunction, which restrains or compels the activities in question. 
(3)  Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user or person is in violation of the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, water service to the user or person may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's or person's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply. 
(4)  Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The city may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user or other person. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response guide.

13.24.370 - Fat, oil, and grease control. 
(a)  Scope and Purpose. The objective of this section is to aid in preventing the introduction and accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into the municipal wastewater system which will or tend to cause or contribute to sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions. Food service establishments (FSE) and other industrial or commercial establishments generating wastewater containing fats, oils or greases are subject to this section. This section regulates such users by requiring that grease interceptors and other approved strategies be installed, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
(b)  Definitions. The definitions contained in Section 13.24.010 and the following terms, when used in this section, shall apply. 
(1)  "Action level" means the concentration based numeric value that the grease interceptor effluent, at the device's outlet tee and prior to mixing with any other wastewater from the contributing establishment's property, are expected to achieve on a consistent or stipulated basis. 
(2)  "Common interceptor" means one or more interceptors receiving FOG laden wastewater from more than one establishment. Common interceptors may be located at shopping centers, malls, entertainment complexes, sporting arenas, hotels, multi-tenant "flex" spaces, mixed use spaces, and other sites where multiple establishments are connected to a single grease interceptor. The owner of the property on which the common grease interceptor is located shall be primarily responsible for the maintenance, upkeep, and repair of the common interceptor. 
(3)  "Fats," "oils," and "greases" means organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures established in 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease" or "greases" or "FOG". 
(4)  "Food service establishments (FSE)" means those establishments primarily engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sautéing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching, and infrared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation or serving activity that produces a consumable food product in or on a receptacle requiring washing to be reused. 
(5)  "FOG enforcement response plan" means the document and written plan and procedures by which the director implements an enforcement strategy applicable to the FOG control and management program established herein. The plan applies to FOG program violations and matters of program noncompliance. Stipulated penalties for specific and programmatic infractions are addressed in the plan. 
(6)  "Grease trap" or "interceptor" means a device for separating waterborne greases and grease complexes from wastewater and retaining such greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Grease traps also serve to collect solids that settle, generated by and from activities that subject users to this section, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Grease traps and interceptors are sometimes referred to herein as "grease interceptors". 
(7)  "Minimum design capability" means the design features of a grease interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases and settled solids from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary sewer. 
(8)  "Non-cooking establishments" means those establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any form of cooking, but that may produce a consumable food product in or on a receptacle requiring washing to be reused. 
(9)  "On-site grease interceptor treatment" (sometimes "onsite treatment") means mechanisms or procedures utilized by a user to treat grease interceptor contents on the user's site, followed by the reintroduction of such treated wastewater back into the interceptor. 
(10)  "Program acknowledgement certificate" means program confirmation documentation issued by the director. The user is required to keep program acknowledgement certificate on premises and produce it upon request of the city. 
(11)  "Service provider" means any third party not in the employment of the user that performs maintenance, repair, and other services on a user's grease interceptor at the user's directive. 
(12)  "User" is as defined in Section 13.24.010 for the purpose of this section. Users include property owners who provide common interceptors for one or more independent establishments, including tenants. 
(c)  Grease Interceptor Installation, Maintenance, Recordkeeping, and Grease Removal. 
(1)  Grease interceptors shall be installed and maintained at the user's expense, when a user operates a food service establishment. Grease interceptors may be required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when the establishment generates wastewater containing fat or grease and the director determines an interceptor is necessary to prevent contribution or accumulation of grease to the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Upon notification by the director or designee that the user is subject to the terms of an enforcement action, as stipulated in the FOG enforcement response plan, said user shall not allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject grease interceptor to exceed an establishment action level of two hundred milligrams per liter, expressed as hexane extractable material. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design, and capacity approved by the director and shall be readily and easily accessible for maintenance and repair, including cleaning and for town inspection. All grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every sixty days or as permitted in a valid program modification. Users who are required to pass wastewater through a grease interceptor shall: 
(A)  Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of twenty-four minutes at actual peak flow between the influent and effluent baffles, with twenty-five percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for any food-derived solids to settle or accumulate and floatable grease-derived materials to rise and accumulate, identified hereafter as a solids blanket and grease cap respectively. 
(B)  Remove any accumulated grease cap and solids blanket as required, but at intervals of not longer than sixty days at the user's expense, or in accordance with a valid program modification or other director's requirements. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials, such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this solids blanket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor. 
(C)  If the user performs on-site grease interceptor treatment pursuant to a modification granted under Section 13.24.370(c)(5) below, user shall: 
i.  Prior to commencement of onsite treatment obtain written approval by and from the director of all processes utilized in said onsite treatment. 
ii.  If any pumped wastes or other materials removed from the grease interceptor are treated in any fashion on-site and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after such on-site treatment, the user shall meet the criteria contained in Section 13.24.370(c)(1)(C)iii. below. 
iii.  Attain and adhere to the criteria listed below: 
a.  After thirty minutes of settling time, not more than three ml/L of settleable solids, as measured in a one liter Imhoff cone shall be allowed, and; 
b.  Within and not more than twenty-four hours after onsite grease interceptor servicing, not more than two inches of settleable solids and/or grease shall be allowed to have accumulated therein as a result of said operations. 
c.  Any tanks, tankage, or vessel(s) associated with a modification shall be empty upon arrival at the initial FSE user site for which this modification is intended to be applied. 
(D)  Operate and maintain the grease interceptor to achieve and consistently maintain any applicable grease action level. "Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from such grease interceptor must meet the terms of numerical limit attainment described in Section 13.24.370(c)(1). If a user documents that conditions exist ("space constraints") on their establishment site that limit the ability to locate a grease interceptor on the exterior of the establishment, the user may request an interior location for the interceptor. Such request shall contain the following information: 
i.  Location of city's sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building. 
ii.  Existing plumbing layout at or in a site. 
iii.  A statement of understanding, signed by the user or authorized agent, acknowledging and accepting conditions director may place on permitting an identified interior location. Conditions may include requirements to use alternative mechanisms, devices, procedures, or operations relative to an interior location. 
iv.  Such other information as may be required by the director. 
(E)  The use of biological or other additives as a grease degradation or conditioning agent is permissible only upon prior written approval of the director. Any user using biological or other additives shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of any grease wastewater, action level, solids blanket or grease cap criteria, goal or directive, as measured from the grease interceptor outlet or interior, is consistently achieved. 
(F)  The use of automatic grease removal systems is permissible only upon prior written approval of the director. 
(G)  The director may make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy, need, design, appropriateness, application, location, modification(s), and conditional usage based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review by all regulatory reviewing agencies and may require repairs to, or modification or replacement of grease interceptors. 
(2)  The user shall maintain a written record of grease interceptor maintenance for three years. All such records will be available for inspection by the town at all times. These records shall include: 
(A)  Food service establishment (FSE) name and physical location; 
(B)  Date of grease interceptor service;

(H)  Approximated amount, per best professional judgment of contract service provider, of grease and solids removed from each grease interceptor; 
(I)  Total volume of waste removed from each grease interceptor; 
(J)  Destination of removed wastes, food solids, and wastewater disposal; 
(K)  Signature and date of FSE personnel confirming service completion; 
(L)  Such other information as required by director. 
(3)  No nongrease-laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines intended for grease interceptor service. 
(4)  Access manholes shall have an installed diameter of twenty-four inches, a maximum weight of fifty pounds, and shall be provided over each chamber, interior baffle wall, and each sanitary tee. The access penetrations, commonly referred to as "risers" into the grease interceptor shall also be, at a minimum, twenty-four inches in diameter. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities. 
(5)  A user may request a modification to the following requirements of this section. Such request for a modification shall be in writing and shall provide the information set forth below. 
(A)  The User's Grease Interceptor Pumping Frequency. The director may modify the sixty-day grease interceptor pump out frequency when the user provides data, and performance criteria relative to the overall effectiveness of a proposed alternate and such can be substantiated by the director.

Chapter 14.52 - FLOOD PLAIN ZONING REGULATION[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2169, §§ I-IX, adopted Nov. 5, 2012, repealed the former Ch. 14.52, §§ 14.52.010-14.52.170, and enacted a new Ch. 14.52 as set out herein. The former Ch. 14.52 pertained to flood protection and derived from Ord. 1746 §§ 1(A)-1(C), §§ 2(A)-2(F), §§ 3, 4, §§ 5(A)-5(C), §§ 6-8, adopted 1988. 

14.52.010 - Statutory authority, findings of fact and purpose. 
(a)  The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare. 
(b)  Findings of Fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Fort Dodge are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community. 
(2)  These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(c)  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Fort Dodge and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in Section 14.52.010(b)(1) of this chapter with provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement. 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard. 
(4)  Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. No. 2169, § I, 11-5-12) 
14.52.020 - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Fort Dodge shown on the official flood plain zoning map as being within the boundaries of the floodway fringe (overlay) district, as established in Section 14.52.030. 
(b)  Establishment of Official Flood Plain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Webster County and Incorporated Areas, City of Fort Dodge, Panels 19187C0190A, 0195A, 0225A, 0305A, 0310A, 0350A, dated December 4, 2012, which were prepared as part of the Webster County Flood Insurance Study, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the official flood plain zoning map. The flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with the flood insurance study are also declared to be a part of this chapter. 
(c)  Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the official flood plain zoning map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the zoning administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. 
(e)  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(f)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the designated floodway fringe (overlay) district areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Fort Dodge or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made there under. 
(h)  Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(Ord. No. 2169, § II, 11-5-12) 
14.52.030 - Establishment of zoning (overlay) district. 
    The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby identified as the floodway fringe (overlay) district (FF). The boundaries shall be as shown on the official flood plain zoning map. 
(Ord. No. 2169, § III, 11-5-12) 
14.52.040 - Standards for floodway fringe (overlay) district (FF). 
    All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards. Development which involves the placement of structures, factory built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment, excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to determine whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe. Where one hundred-year flood elevations and floodway data have not been provided in the flood insurance study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.

(3)  New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the one hundred-year flood elevation. 
(4)  Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems. 
(g)  Storage of materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the one hundred-year flood level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or (i) not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters or (ii) be readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
(h)  Flood control structural works such as levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a one hundred-year flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be approved by the Department of Natural Resources. 
(i)  Watercourse alterations or relocations must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources. 
(j)  Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.

(G)  Submit to the Federal Insurance Administrator an annual report concerning the community's participation, utilizing the annual report form supplied by the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
(H)  Notify the Federal Insurance Administration of any annexations or modifications to the community's boundaries. 
(I)  Review subdivision proposals to insure such proposals are consistent with the purpose of this chapter and advise the city council of potential conflict. 
(b)  Flood Plain Development Permit. 
(1)  Permit Required. A flood plain development permit issued by the administrator shall be secured prior to any flood plain development (any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations), including the placement of factory-built homes. 
(2)  Application for Permit. Application shall be made on forms furnished by the administrator and shall include the following: 
(A)  Description of the work to be covered by the permit for which application is to be made. 
(B)  Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done (i.e., lot, block, track, street address or similar description) that will readily identify and locate the work to be done. 
(C)  Indication of the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended. 
(D)  Elevation of the one hundred-year flood. 
(E)  Elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) of the lowest floor (including basement) of buildings or of the level to which a building is to be floodproofed.

(G)  Such other information as the administrator deems reasonably necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter. 
(3)  Action on Permit Application. The administrator shall, within a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed flood plain development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the board of adjustment. 
(4)  Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans. Flood plain development permits based on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill, building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or occupancy of any structure.

Chapter 16.12. - JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURE 
Sections: 

16.12.010 - Jurisdiction. 
(a)  These subdivision regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land, as defined herein, located within the corporate limits of the city and within the unincorporated areas within two miles of the corporate limits of the city. 
(b)  No land shall be subdivided within the corporate limits of the city and within the unincorporated areas within two miles of the corporate limits of the city until: 
(1)  The sudivider or his agent has obtained final approval of the plan itself by the city council; and 
(2)  The approved plat is filed with the Webster County recorder. 
(c)  No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective date of, and not in conformity with the provisions of these subdivision regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with these regulations. 
(d)  With regard to subdivisions located within the unincorporated areas within two miles of the corporate limits of the city of Fort Dodge, the commission and council shall have the right to waive the requirements contained in this chapter to the end that the commission and council are satisfied that suitable restrictions and regulations have been placed on the subdivisions by the county plan and zoning commission and county board of supervisors; provided, however, that the secretary of the county plan and zoning commission furnish the city plan and zoning commission with a copy of the subdivision certifying that all requirements and appropriate county ordinances, including but not limited to Webster County subdivision ordinance, have been met. The commission shall thereafter study the plat to determine that no conflict exists with the extension of existing streets and rights-of-way within the city into the unincorporated areas and whether the plat would otherwise interfere in any way with the carrying out of the comprehensive plan for the city. If the commission is satisfied by their studies that these conditions are provided for, they shall endorse their approval upon the plat and submit it to the city council. Upon approval by the city council, the city planner shall notify the county auditor and recorder according to the provisions of existing statutes. The purpose of this section is to facilitate the orderly processing of subdivisions in unincorporated areas within two miles of the city, and to avoid conflicting regulations while at the same time assuring that provisions are made for proper and orderly growth of the city as outlined in the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 1641 Art. 3 § 1, 1984). 
16.12.020 - Procedure-Preapplication conference. 
    Whenever a subdivision of any tract of land located within the platting jurisdiction of the city of Fort Dodge is proposed, it is recommended that the applicant submit to the Fort Dodge planning department a request for a preapplication conference. The conference should include the applicant or his engineer, or both, along with staff from the city planning department and city engineering department. The purpose of the conference shall be to acquaint the city staff with proposed subdivision and acquaint the applicant and his engineer with the procedures and with any special problems that might relate to the proposed subdivision. By way of concept review at this stage it is intended that potential problems will be avoided, and development cost savings will result. 
    Sketch Plan. The developer shall have the option to submit a sketch plan to the plan commission and/or city council for preliminary approval prior to incurring significant costs in preliminary development. This sketch plan may be of a format determined by the developer and shall indicate the general layout and procedures to be incorporated in the subsequent preliminary and final plats. 
(a)  The subdivider shall prepare and file with the city clerk five copies of a preliminary plat as well as a three hundred-dollar filing fee which conforms to the requirements set forth in this regulation. The city clerk shall then forward said copies to the city planner for review. 
(b)  The city planner shall forthwith refer two copies to the city engineer. 
(c)  The city engineer and city planner shall examine said plan as to its compliance with the laws and regulations of the city, the existing street system, and good engineering and planning practices, and shall within fifteen days, submit their findings to the city plan commission. 
(d)  The city plan commission shall, upon receiving the city engineer's and city planner's report, as soon as possible but not more than thirty days thereafter, consider said report and pass upon the plan. It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification or disapproval. In case of modification or disapproval, it shall give its reasons therefor. 
    The city plan commission shall forthwith return one copy of the approved preliminary plat to the subdivider. 
(e)  Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the city plan commission, the subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and detailed construction drawings and specifications for the improvements required under this regulation. 
(f)  In the case that the proposed subdivision constitutes a minor plat, no preliminary plat shall be required. 
(g)  The approval of the preliminary plat by the city plan commission is revocable and does not constitute final approval or acceptance of the subdivision by the city council or authorization to proceed on construction of improvements within the subdivision but shall constitute approval of layout and general planning proposals. 
(h)  Before submitting the final plat to the city plan commission for approval, the subdivider shall furnish all plans, specifications and information as necessary for the detailed engineering consideration of the improvements required to the city engineer. 
(i)  For final plat approval, and at least fourteen days prior to its consideration for final approval at public meeting, the subdivider shall submit to the city plan commission: 
(1)  A reproducible copy of the final plat; 
(2)  Certification from the city engineer that specifications for the improvements are acceptable and that the final plat is substantially in accord with the preliminary plat as approved by the city plan commission; 
(3)  A performance bond and a maintenance bond in amounts approved by the city engineer, to be approved by the city council, the maintenance bond covering a period of two years on all subdivision improvements conditioned that the subdivider shall maintain such improvements in good repair for the periods specified therein and the performance bond which insures completion of improvements within five years of subdivision approval by the city council. 
(j)  When the final plat has been passed upon the city plan commission, a reproducible copy of the final plat and performance and maintenance bonds shall forthwith be transmitted to the city council, together with a certificate showing the action of the city plan commission as well as all certificates required by state code to be entered of record together with the certified plat. 
(k)  When the final plat has been approved by the city council and the performance and maintenance bond accepted, eleven copies shall be duly certified; one copy shall be forwarded to the city engineer and one copy shall be forwarded to the city clerk for their respective files, and one to the subdivider for recording. Eight copies shall be retained by the city planner. If said plat is disapproved by the city council, such disapproval shall point out in writing where in said proposed plat is objectionable. 
(l)  The passage of a resolution accepting the plat shall constitute approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat, but the owner shall cause such plat to be recorded in the office of the county recorder of Webster County, Iowa, and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the city planner before the city shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect and final approval is granted. If the plat is not recorded within thirty days of the council approval, said approval shall be automatically revoked. The city planner shall upon notification of recording, subsequently notify the city clerk, city building inspector and city engineer of the same. 
(m)  Upon receipt of the evidence of recording of the final plat the city planner will transmit copies of the plat, upon which have been placed the official house numbers as determined by the city engineer, to the subdivider, the waterworks department, the gas company, the telephone company, the city building inspector/zoning administrator and postmaster. 
(n)  Upon provision of evidence of recording of the final plat to the city planner by the subdivider, he may proceed with the installation and construction of the required improvements. 
(o)  The city council will return the performance bond to the subdivider upon certification by the city engineer of satisfactory completion of the improvements and acceptance thereof by the city council. Prior to certification by the city engineer, the subdivider shall file with the city engineer plans of the required improvements as they have been built. 
(p)  Upon being notified in writing by the city planning department that the certified final plat has been recorded, the building department may proceed to issue building permits for lots contained within such plat. 
(q)  No certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of street, water, and sanitary sewer improvements, and dedication of same to and accepted by the city or the entity responsible for the operation and maintenance of such improvement, as specified in the approved construction plans and final subdivision plat as recorded.

Chapter 16.16 - PLANNING CRITERIA 
Sections: 

16.16.010 - Streets. 
(a)  New subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for the public requirements. Where the parcel of land is subdivided into larger tracts than ordinarily used for building lots, such parcel shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets, may, at the discretion of the city council, be made a requirement of the plat. 
(b)  The width and locations of major street rights-of-way shall be sixty feet. Where streets adjoin unsubdivided property a half-street at least thirty feet in width shall be dedicated. No private improvements shall be utilized for occupancy. 
(c)  Alleys shall not be provided in a residential block. Alleys are required in the rear of all business lots and shall be at least twenty feet wide. The city council shall have the right to waive the required alley at the rear of business lots where the public interest will still be served. 
(d)  Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length of five hundred feet and shall terminate at the closed end with a vehicular turnaround (minimum fifty-foot radius right-of-way circular). 
(e)  In the case of temporarily dead-ended streets, which are stub streets designed to provide future connection with unsubdivided areas adjoining, the city council may require a temporary easement for a turnaround of the nature indicated above, or an appropriate area for a background, or a roadway at least twenty-seven feet in width of not excessive length to connect the temporary dead-end with an existing street. 
(f)  Streets should be laid out to intersect at right angles, and may be curved approaching the intersection in order to bring this about; no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than sixty degrees. The design of the intersection should be such that a clear sight distance will be maintained for seventy-five feet at the roadway centerline, with no obstruction to sight within the triangle formed at these points. 
(g)  Streets that are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets shall be shown on the final plat and such names shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. The city engineer shall propose street names and house numbers. 
(Ord. 1641 Art. 4 § 1, 1984). 
16.16.020 - Blocks-Lots. 
(a)  No block shall be longer than one thousand feet between street lines. An easement near the center of the block not less than ten feet wide for a crosswalk may be required on blocks that are over seven hundred fifty feet in length. The width of blocks shall not be less than two hundred feet and not more than seven hundred fifty feet. 
(b)  The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the character of surrounding development. 
(c)  The width and area of all lots shall comply to the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. However, no residential lot shall be less than sixty feet in width at the front building line, or less than one hundred feet in depth, or less than six thousand square feet in area. However, in subdivisions which are concurrently being approved for zero lot line regulations, lot sizes may be reduced to a minimum of thirty-five feet in width and a minimum of four thousand square feet in area. 
(d)  Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the establishment of front building lines on both adjoining streets. Corner lots, however, shall be a minimum of fifty feet in width and five thousand square feet in area. 
(e)  In all lots so far as possible, the side lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines except where a variation of this rule will prove a better street and lot layout. 
(f)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where their use will produce definite advantages in meeting special situations in relation to topography, sound site planning and property land use. 
(g)  A strip of land shall not be reserved by the subdivider unless the land is of sufficient size and shape to be of some practical use or service as determined by the city plan commission. 
(Ord. 1641 Art. 4 § 2, 1984). 
16.16.030 - Parks and school sites. 
    If the land to be subdivided contains sites that are designated in the comprehensive city plan to be used for schools or parks, the developer of the subdivision shall dedicate or reserve such site for such use. In the event that sites have been so reserved and are not acquired by the city, by the board of education, or other interested public agency, within one year of the final approval of the final plat, then such sites may be subdivided by the developer or proprietor of the subdivision in the usual manner, subject accordingly to all pertinent and prevailing zoning regulations in the said area. 
(Ord. 1641 Art. 4 § 4, 1984). 
16.16.040 - Character of development. 
    The city plan commission and city council may require that certain minimum regulations regarding type and character of development be incorporated in the owner's declaration of plat. Such regulations shall be intended to protect the character and development of the platted subdivision, as well as that of the surrounding development.

(a)  Prior to the offering of the plat of any subdivision for record, the registered land surveyor shall confirm the prior establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent control monuments exist, the registered land surveyor shall establish at least two permanent control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments shall be constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment. The registered land surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the registered land surveyor to the top of the monument. 
(b)  Other monuments established prior to the recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Monuments other than the permanent control monuments required in Subsection (a) of this section shall not be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the registered land surveyor includes in the certification of the plat that the additional monuments required by this chapter or by any local ordinance shall be established before a specified future date. 
(d)  Additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in this section, and shall be set at all of the following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or subsequent to such recording: 
(1)  At every corner and angle point of every lot, block or parcel of land created; 
(2)  At every point of intersection of the outer boundary of the subdivision with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street, railroad, or other way; 
(3)  At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve on every right-of-way line established. 
    When the placement of a monument required by this chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location. If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument shall be confirmed by the registered land surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.

The regulations set by this Ordinance within each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, and particularly, except as hereinafter provided.
A. No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with all the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located.

A. Official Zoning Map. The City shall be divided into districts, as shown on the Official Zoning Map which, together with all explanatory matter thereon shall be adopted by Ordinance.
The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the Seal of the City, under the following words: This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in Section 17.10.02 of Ordinance No. 1491 of the City of Fort Dodge, Iowa, together with the date of adoption.
If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance and Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council, with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: By official action of the City Council, the following changes are made in the Official Zoning Map. (Indicating the changes by Ordinance Numbers and date of publication).

unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance and punishable as provided under Section 17.09.03.
Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or published, the City Planner shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the City.
B. Replacement of the Official Zoning Map. In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the City Council may by Ordinance adopt a new Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original Official Zoning Map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the Seal of the City under the following words: This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted as part of Ordinance No. 1160 of the City of Fort Dodge, Iowa.
Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
17.02.03  RULES INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
A. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines;

F. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in Subsections A through C above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
G. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by Subsections A through F above, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries.
H. Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may permit, as a special exception, the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot except in the case of an overlay district boundary. Where an overlay district boundary divides a lot, the overlay district regulations shall apply to the entire lot and also to the entire development area when being considered as part of a site plan review as required in Section 17.08.03.
I. Whenever Council vacates and disposes of a Street or Alley, adjacent districts shall extend to the centerline of the vacation.

d) characteristics of use,
which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendment.

Non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.

a) No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
b) No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.

a) No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located except for existing manufacturing, assembly or repair shops (fully enclosed) as provided for in Section 17.07.11.D.3.
b) Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
c) If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to another non-conforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Ordinance.
d) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.

Updated 11/23/2021
38
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
f) When non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost at time of destruction, except in the Downtown District where any damaged structure for existing manufacturing, assembly or repair shops (fully enclosed) may be replaced as provided for by special exception.
17.04.06 Repair and Maintenance  On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of the current replacement cost of the non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased. In the case of those existing manufacturing, assembly or repair shops (fully enclosed) allowed by Section 17.07.11.D.3 in the Downtown District, this provision shall not apply.
If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
17.04.07 Uses Under Special Exception Provisions Not Non-Conforming Uses  Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this Ordinance (other than a change through Board of Adjustment action from a non-conforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a non-conforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.

17.07.11 D  DOWNTOWN DISTRICT
A. INTENT: This District is intended to accommodate a mixed use of buildings that provide a variety of retail, service, entertainment, office, lodging, residential and civic functions. It is also intended to preserve and build upon the historic character of the central business district, create attractive entry points and plazas centered on the pedestrian, and maintain appropriate buffers to surrounding residential areas.
B. DOWNTOWN DISTRICT SUBDISTRICTS: Because different areas of the downtown have differing intensities of use, physical characters and functions, two zoning sub-districts, each with its own set of allowable uses, bulk and setback regulations, and design standards control development and use in the traditional downtown of the City. The locations of these two sub-districts are shown on the Official Zoning Map for the City of Fort Dodge. The purpose of each sub-district is described as follows:
1. D-1 Downtown Core Sub-District: The D-1 Downtown Core Sub-District is intended for the historic commercial core of the City located along Central Avenue. Regulations maintain the pedestrian-orientation and reflect the traditional character of downtown development. Parking is a secondary use; therefore, it is not located such that it would be visible from a public street. A variety of commercial uses are permitted, including mercantile (retail) goods and personal service establishments, educational, office and medical uses, as well as residential uses that are consistent with the density and intensity of downtown development patterns. Mixed-use development involving different combinations of commercial, office and residential uses in individual buildings is encouraged for the D-1 Downtown Core Sub-District.
2. D-2 Downtown Corridor Sub-District: The D-2 Downtown Corridor Sub-District is intended to accommodate a variety of office, mercantile (retail), commercial and existing light manufacturing land uses that can thrive when provided direct or adjacent access to downtowns arterial streets that function as the gateways to the downtown core. It is also a transition area from primarily residential to the Citys downtown core business district. The district allows a variety of mercantile (retail) goods establishments, personal service establishments and office uses, which are typically oriented toward vehicular access and may be located within larger retail centers. Many of the lots in this district that accommodate these uses also provide on-site parking, with proper screening to promote the pedestrian scale.
C. PERMITTED USES: Table 17.07.11-1 establishes the permitted uses, uses permitted subject to a special exception, or uses permitted subject to specific conditions and requirements intended to make them compatible with and acceptable to adjacent uses. Uses not identified in the table are not permitted. The legend for this table is as follows:
P  Permitted: This use is permitted within the Downtown Sub-District. A property owner or developer should take into account Bulk, Site and Building Design, Site

Plan, and Sign regulations, as addressed within this Ordinance.
S  Special Exception: This use is permitted subject to review by the Citys Board of Adjustment, which shall find that requirements of Section 17.06.02.B are met, and that the proposed use will be compatible with the character of the neighborhood, promote goals of adopted plans and create synergies among uses.
C  Permitted with Conditions: This use is permitted subject to review by the Citys Planning Staff, which shall find pertinent requirements of 17.07.11.D. are met for the applicable use.

2. Parking may be provided in a designated parking lot, either adjacent to or non-adjacent to the lot, where the parking spaces are within 500 of the entrance to the principal building on a lot as measured on a reasonable walking path from the furthest space to the building entry for each use.
3. Required off-street parking may be provided in a parking lot under different ownership or management than the lot being supplied with parking, so long as a shared parking agreement is signed by the owners of all properties involved and then recorded with Webster County and a copy of that is filed with the City. The agreement should indicate the number of required spaces to be provided for a specific user and the reasonable long-term commitment of both parties to maintain the demand for and supply of such parking.
4. To foster shared parking in the downtown district, a reduction in the total parking required for two or more uses may be requested. The following regulations apply for establishing such an agreement and calculating the reduced amount of required parking.
a. For any property under one ownership and used for two or more uses, the number of spaces shall be computed by multiplying the minimum amount of parking required for each land use, as stated under Section 17.07.11.G.1 (above), by the appropriate percentage as shown in the shared parking requirements by time period (see Table 17.07.11-7). The number of spaces required for the development is then determined by adding the results in each column. The column totaling the highest number of parking spaces becomes the minimum off-street parking requirement.
Updated 11/23/2021
107
b. For two or more uses under multiple ownership, the total off-street parking requirement may be satisfied by providing a joint parking facility, and the minimum requirements may be reduced in accordance with the procedure outlined in Section 17.07.11.G.4.a. (above) for shared parking for single ownership. The appropriateness of shared parking shall be determined during site plan review, provided the following criteria are met:
i. The shared parking facility is within 500 linear feet, measured along the most appropriate walking routes between the furthest space of the shared parking facility and the entrances to all establishments being served.
ii. The applicant provides a recorded shared-use parking agreement per Section 17.07.11.G.3.

17.07.15 PD  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
A. INTENT: This district is intended to provide flexible land use and design regulations through the use of performance criteria so that small-to-large scale neighborhoods, or portions thereof, may be developed with a variety of residential types and non-residential uses, may contain both individual building sites and common property which are planned and developed as a unit. Such a planned development is to be designed and organized so as to be capable of satisfactory use and operation as a separate entity without necessarily needing the participation of other building sites or other common property in order to function as a neighborhood. Planned Development specifically encourages innovations so that the growing demands of housing may be met by greater variety in type, design, and siting of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land.
This district recognizes that the standard zoning function (use and bulk) and the subdivision function (platting and design) are appropriate for the regulation of land use in areas or neighborhoods that are already substantially developed. This district further recognizes that a rigid set of space requirements along with bulk and use specifications would frustrate the application of the Planned Development concept. Therefore, where PD techniques are deemed appropriate the land may be rezoned to a PD District providing an approval process in which an approved PD plan becomes the basis for continuing land use controls.
To carry out the intent a PD District endeavors to provide:
1. A choice in the types of environment, occupancy tenure (e.g., cooperatives, individual ownership, condominium, leasing, etc.) types of housing, types of ownership, and community facilities available to existing and potential residents.
2. Useable open space and recreation areas.
3. Convenience in location of accessory commercial and service areas.
4. Preservation of natural topographical, geological features with emphasis upon:
a. Prevention of soil erosion.
b. Conservation of existing surface and subsurface water.
c. Preservation of major trees or other environmental enhancing features.
5. An efficient network of streets and utilities.
Updated 11/23/2021

4. Public and private educational and recreational facilities.
C. ACCESSORY USES: Uses of land or structure customarily incidental and subordinate to a permitted use in the PD District:
1. Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to a permitted use.
2. Storage of material or merchandise incidental to the principal use, but not to exceed 40% of the floor area for each purposes.
D. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS: All uses permitted in the PD District are subject to specific conditions and requirements intended to make them compatible with and acceptable to adjacent uses.

-Total car ratio 1.2
5. All non-residential uses  F.A.R.  1.0, excluding bulk regulations above.
6. The above bulk regulations, when met, do not automatically constitute approval of the submitted plan. The City Council reserves the right to approve or reject any plans submitted that are not in conformance with the Citys Comprehensive Plan, are not properly related to adequate traffic arteries, are not compatible with surrounding land uses or are not otherwise in the best interest of the City of Fort Dodge.

2. A PD which only involves one housing type, such as all detached or all attached units, shall not be considered as inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this section and shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval.
3. Architectural style of buildings shall not solely be a basis for denial or approval of a plan. However, the overall appearance and compatibility of individual buildings to other site elements or to surrounding development will be primary consideration in the review stages of the Plan and Zoning Commission and City Council.
4. No building permit shall be granted for any buildings on land for which a plan for a PD is in the process of City review or which does not conform to the approved final plan.
5. Staging of Development:
a. Any PD plan proposed to be constructed in stages shall include full details relating thereto and the City Council may approve or modify where necessary, any such proposals.

6. Open Space: A primary function of the PD provision is to encourage development which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain characteristics and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order to arrive at the maximum density allowed. In evaluating each individual proposal the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial including but not limited to the following:
a. The amount and location of common open space shall be consistent with the stated purpose and intent of this section.
b. All common open space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or designed functions.
Updated 11/23/2021

7. Covenants, Easements, and Restrictions: The final plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the bulk, location and density of such residential units, non-residential uses and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the PD and area consistent with the best interest of the entire city. All or any of the covenants, easements and other provisions, if part of the final plan may be modified, enforced, removed or released as deemed necessary by the City Council for the preservation of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of all city residents.
8. Streets, Utilities, Services and Public Facilities: The uniqueness of each proposal for a PD requires that specifications and standards for streets, utilities and services shall be subject to minor modifications from the specifications and standards established in this and other city ordinances governing their construction. The City Council may therefore waive or modify the specifications or standards where it is found that they are not required in the interests of the residents or of the entire city. The plans and profiles of all streets, utilities and services shall be reviewed, modified if necessary, and approved by the City Engineer, Fire Chief, and Building Inspector, prior to the final approval of the PD plan by the City Council.

17.08.02 - WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES: ESTABLISHING REQUIREMENTS FOR SITING AND DESIGN OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, FACILITIES AND RELATED UTILITIES.
A. Purpose. The provisions of this section are intended to regulate and guide the location of new communication towers, antennas, and related accessory structures. It is the Desire of the City of Fort Dodge to encourage the development of an aesthetically pleasing local environment. It is also the intent of the City to encourage the expansion of wireless technology, as it provides a valuable service to City residents and businesses. It is not the Citys goal to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and to not have the effect of prohibiting, either directly or indirectly, the provisions of personal wireless services. It is the Citys goal to encourage wireless providers to construct new facilities disguised through techniques of camouflage design, as defined in this Ordinance. It is the intent of these regulations to achieve the following objectives:
1. To minimize the adverse visual effects of communication structures through careful design, siting, locating, and screening;
2. To locate and engineer communications support structures in a manner which minimizes potential damage to adjacent properties from structural failure; and
3. To allow for the reasonable location and efficient use of communication structures through the co-location of carriers.
B. Definitions, as used in this Chapter:
1. Base station  a structure other than a tower that supports or houses an antenna, transceiver, or other associated equipment that constitutes part of a base station at the time the relevant application is filed with the City, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support, but does not include structures that do not at that time support or house base station components.
2. Camouflage design  Structures and associated equipment taking on the appearance of a piece of art, a natural feature, an architectural structural component or other similar element and which aesthetically blends with the surrounding building environment. Examples of camouflage design include, but are not limited to: architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas; antennas integrated into architectural elements; antennas designed to look other than an antenna; antennas integrated into existing buildings, sports field lights, highway signs, water towers, etc; and towers designed to blend into the surrounding environment or to look other than a tower, such as flag poles, trees, clock towers, monuments, and church steeples. All such designs are subject to the review and approval of the
Updated 11/23/2021
172
communications carrier, the landlord, and the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee. If deemed to require a special exception, the request would be contingent upon approval by the Board of Adjustment.
3. Collocation  the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure, as defined in this section, for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes.
4. Communications structure  any communications tower, antenna, and related accessory structure used in the transmission or reception of microwave energy, analog data transfer techniques, radio frequency energy, and other digital data transfer techniques.
5. Communication structure site  a tract or parcel of land that contains the wireless communication structure, accessory building(s), on-site parking, and may include other uses associated with and necessary for wireless communication and transmission.
6. Effectively screened  an area of planting which provides an effective visual barrier. For a single row the screen shall consist of Spruce, Fir, or Pine trees spaced at a maximum distance of 15 feet or a double staggered row of Spruce, Fir, or Pine spaced at a maximum interval of 20 feet within each row; for Arborvitae and Juniper the spacing shall be a double staggered row with maximum spacing of 10 feet within each row, or a single row with maximum spacing of 6 feet.
7. Eligible facilities request  any request for modification of any existing wireless tower or base station that involves (a) collocation of new transmission equipment; (b) removal of transmission equipment; or (c) replacement of transmission equipment.
8. Eligible support structure  any tower or base station, as defined in this section, provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed to the City.
9. Existing  tower or base station previously reviewed and approved under the applicable local zoning or siting process.
10. Lattice tower  an antenna support tower that is self-supporting with multiple legs and cross-bracing of structural steel.
11. Minimum height  the lowest vertical distance at which the structure can still operate at an efficient level of service. An efficient level of service is deemed to be 95% or greater of possible service levels.
12. Modification  includes collocation, removal, or replacement of an antenna or any other transmission equipment associated with the supporting structure.
Updated 11/23/2021
173
13. Monopole  a tower consisting of a single vertical structure not supported by radiating guy wires or support structure. A monopole tower shall be distinctive from a two-legged or multi-legged, lattice constructed tower structure.
14. Replacement  exchanging of transmission equipment; not to include the structure on which the equipment is located.
15. Structure height  the vertical distance measured from the base of the antenna support structure at grade to the highest point of the structure. If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average between the highest and lowest grades of the cell site shall be used in calculating the height.
16. Substantial change 
a. For all towers and base stations, a substantial change:
i. Involves the installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets;
ii. Entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site or the tower or base station;
iii. Defeats the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station; or
iv. Does not comply with conditions associated with the prior approval of construction or modification of the tower or base station unless the non-compliance is due to any of the substantial change thresholds as identified below.
b. For towers outside of the public right-of-way, a substantial change:

A. INTENT AND PURPOSES: The purposes of this chapter are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the citys ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. The intent of this chapter as more specifically set out is:
1. Ensure that the informational needs of sign users are met in a way that is compatible with the surrounding urban environment;
2. Improve the legibility, efficiency and graphic design of individual signs;
3. Provide for the design, location, and maintenance of signs in a manner that does not endanger public safety, or increase the probability of traffic congestion and accidents;
4. Reduce conflict among signs and lights and between public and private information systems;
5. Provide flexibility for sign users to communicate effectively within certain standards;
6. Recognize the special characteristics of specific areas and the impact of signage on urban environmental design.
B. APPLICABILITY: A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created or maintained within the city only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions and other requirements of this chapter. The effect of this chapter as more specifically set out is:
1. To implement a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and permit procedures of this chapter;

4. To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this chapter;
Updated 11/23/2021
206

C. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS: Words and phrases used in this chapter have the meanings set forth in this chapter. Words and phrases not defined in this chapter but defined elsewhere in the zoning ordinance or in the adopted building code shall have the meanings set forth in the zoning or adopted building code, respectively. All other words and phrases shall have their common, ordinary meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise. Section headings or captions are for reference purposes only and shall not be used in the interpretation of this chapter.
D. COMPLIANCE AND CONFLICTS: Each sign or part of a sign within the jurisdiction of the City of Fort Dodge, Iowa, must comply with the terms and provisions of this chapter of the Municipal Code of Fort Dodge, Iowa. In the event of conflicts between or among code sections, the most restrictive of these provisions shall apply.
E. COMPUTATIONS: The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
1. Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, skirting, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
2. Computation of Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign area from a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
3. Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area. The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs (attached, detached and on-premise directionals) on a lot shall be limited to the frontage of the premises along a street or private way. For property with frontage on more than one street, the total frontage shall be calculated as the longest frontage plus one-half the length of all additional frontages.
Updated 11/23/2021
207
4. For purposes of this chapter, that part of a property line abutting the right-of-way of a divided four-lane highway, including ramps, shall not be considered street frontage for calculating the maximum total permitted sign area.
5. The maximum allowable area of each monument sign face will be measured from the finish grade to the top of the structure and from one end of the structure to the other. The maximum allowable square feet per sign face shall not be greater than each propertys linear feet of street frontage, as measured on one adjacent street, or one hundred fifty (150) square feet, whichever is less.
6. Properties without street frontage. Any commercial or industrial zoned existing lot of record that do not have street frontage shall be permitted wall signage as described in Section J.1. of this ordinance. The maximum permitted area for any such sign shall be calculated by building frontage, up to 400 square feet. Such sign shall comply with all provisions of this chapter, except that requirements related to street frontage shall not apply.
