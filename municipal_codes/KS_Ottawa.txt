Article VII. Indoor Clean Air

10-701.       Legislative findings.

(A)  Smoking areas may be designated pursuant to K.S.A. 21 4010 by proprietors or other persons in charge of public places, except those places where smoking is prohibited by law.

(B)   There exists a substantial body of scientific research demonstrating that smoking and the effects of second hand smoke pose significant health hazards to persons who are in the presence of smokers.

(C)   Kansas statutory law regarding smoking in public places addresses at K.S.A. 21 4013 the potential for city or county regulation of smoking within its boundaries, so long as such regulation is at least as stringent as state law.

(D)  Secondhand smoke, which contains 4,000 chemicals, 63 of which cause cancer, is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and the National Cancer Institute determined in 2000 (Monograph # 10) that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of as many as 65,000 Americans annually; and

(E)   The Public Health Services National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen (U.S. DHHS, 2000, citing Cal. EPA, 1997), and (2) numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke)is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer; and

(F)   The ills of smoking and secondhand smoke are well documented in all of the independent medical studies and secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, children individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and

(G)  (1) the U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation, (3) air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke, (4) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke free environments because it cannot determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer causing chemicals, and ASHRAE acknowledges that the technology does not exist that can remove chemicals from the air that cause cancer; and

(H)  (1) a recently promulgated ASHRAE Position Document of Environment Tobacco Smoke concludes that at present, the only means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban all smoking activity, and (2) ASHRAE further concludes that no current ventilation, air cleaning or other technologies have been demonstrated to control health risks from environmental tobacco smoke exposure in spaces where smoking occurs; and

(I)    A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace, and employees who work in smoking permitted businesses suffer a higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and a measurable decrease in lung function; and

(J)    Smoke filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke; and

(K)  The Ottawa City Commission recognizes that environmental tobacco smoke poses a serious public health hazard; that nonsmokers need protection from environmental tobacco smoke exposure and that regulation of the burning of tobacco in public places and places of employment is imperative in order to protect the public health and welfare of the citizens of the City of Ottawa;

(L)   Numerous studies have determined that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a significant source of exposure to toxic air indoor contaminants, causally associated with respiratory illness, including lung cancer, asthma and emphysema; and

(M)  There is scientific research linking ETS with heart disease, responsible for an estimated 35,000 coronary heart disease deaths annually among adult nonsmokers in the United States as a result of ETS exposure; and

(N)  ETS carcinogens and poisons pose special risk to children, the elderly, food service employees, and individuals with cardiovascular disease and/or impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and

(O)  ETS exposure has been causally associated with developmental, respiratory, carcinogenic and cardiovascular effects, including fetal outcomes such as sudden infant death syndrome. 

(P)   Tobacco use is the single largest cause of preventable death in Kansas, and according to the CDC’s Tobacco Control State Highlights 2002, tobacco use alone was responsible for an estimated 3,800 deaths in Kansas in 1999, or 16% of the total deaths in Kansas in 1999; and

(Q)  The separation of smokers from nonsmokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to ETS, given that no safe level of exposure to ETS has been found;

(R)   Accordingly the Ottawa City Commission recognizes that ETS poses a serious public health hazard, that nonsmokers need protection from ETS exposure and that therefore, regulation by the Governing Body of the burning of tobacco in public places and places of employment is imperative in order to protect the public health and welfare of the citizens of the City of Ottawa.

A.    Legislative determination.  The Governing Body hereby declares as a matter of legislative determination that:

1.     Adult businesses require special supervision from the Ottawa Police Department in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of Ottawa.

2.     Adult businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.

3.     Allowing or providing such activities creates conditions that generate prostitution, disorderly conduct, fights, drug dealing and usage, infiltration of other criminal activities into the premises, and adversely affects public health by the transfer of contagious or communicable diseases, all of which require a significant and disproportionate allocation of law enforcement resources.

4.     The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the City of Ottawa which demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.

5.     Employees of adult businesses have been convicted of prostitution and other crimes against public morals and crimes involving moral turpitude in adult businesses.

6.     Motels which permit rental of rooms for ten hours or less foster and facilitate prostitution and increase the likelihood of the proliferation of contagious and communicable diseases.

7.     Permitting and/or licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.

8.     There is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and downgrading of property values.

9.     Adult businesses, due to their nature, have operational characteristics which contribute to urban blight and downgrade the quality of life in the adjacent area.

10.   Except for adult cabarets, in those types of adult businesses in which patrons, seminude or scantily clad employees, other entertainers or models come in actual or close contact with patrons and with one another, the sale and consumption of cereal malt beverages and alcoholic liquor should be prohibited since the number and degree of crime and activities set out in subparagraphs (1)-(3) and (5) hereinabove increase and further endanger public health, safety, and welfare and require increased law enforcement and an even greater disproportion of law enforcement and administrative inspections and resources.

11.   The Governing Body desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight.

12.   Because of increased administrative costs incurred by the City Clerk’s office and the Ottawa Police Department and because of the building and health inspections required by the licensing and enforcement processes, the license fees for such establishments and for the entertainers and employees must be set in a reasonable amount to offset the cost to the City so that as far as reasonably possible the costs incurred are borne by the adult businesses, entertainers, and employees and not subsidized by the taxpayers.

13.   Businesses allowing the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquor or cereal malt beverages on the premises frequently are the scene of disturbances, disorderly conduct and other criminal activity.  Furthermore, case law and studies have established that the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquor or cereal malt beverages on the premises of an adult business will increase criminal behavior on the premises and create undesirable community conditions, including depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior and the acceleration of community blight, thereby exacerbating the adverse secondary effects associated with such businesses.

14.   It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment business to prevent the exploitation of minors, to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult, to ensure that each such entertainer has not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible, and to ensure that such entertainers are not involved in criminal activity.

15.   It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will, at all necessary times, be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees.

16.   Hidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment business in the absence of regulation.  These hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white collar crime elements.  In order for the City to effectively protect the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry, it is important that the City be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments.

17.   The harmful secondary effects of adult businesses are more pronounced when conducted continuously or during late night hours, and limiting the hours of operation of such businesses will enable law enforcement to concentrate its limited resources for those business hours.

18.   Certain employees of unregulated adult businesses engage in a higher incidence of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments; further, an applicant for an adult business or employee license that has been convicted of a sexually-related crime is likely to engage in that behavior again in the future, and preventing such a person from opening or working at an adult business for a specified period of time will help to reduce the chance that such crimes will occur at the business.

B.    The secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this Article are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and therefore, such activities must be regulated as provided in this Article.

C.    It is the purpose of this Article to promote, protect, and secure the general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of Ottawa and to preserve and protect the quality of life by all citizens and especially minors by regulating the secondary effects of such businesses.  It is not the intent of this Article to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact content neutral regulations which address the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.  Finally, it is not the intent of this Article to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity, as obscenity is regulated by state law.

Article XII. Pay Day Loan & Title Loan Businesses

11-1201.     Findings and purpose.

The Governing Body members, Planning Commissioners and City staff have conducted a review of several available reports and studies concerning the payday loan and title businesses.

The City Attorney has reviewed court cases regarding the regulation of payday loan and title businesses and any detrimental secondary effects associated with such businesses and has advised the Governing Body as to the rationale for the holdings in such court cases.  Among the court cases and research reviewed and relied upon in the enactment of this Article are the following: 

A.    Legislative determination.  The Governing Body hereby declares as a matter of legislative determination that:

1.     Pay Day Loan and Title Loan businesses require licensing in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of Ottawa.

2.     Certain loan and title loan practices have proven detrimental to the financial security of individuals and families residing in the city.  Some lending practices often have an unreasonably adverse effect upon the elderly, the economically disadvantaged and other residents of the city.

3.     Permitting and/or licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of pay day and title loan businesses comply with reasonable regulations.

4.     It is important to regulate the placement and location of such businesses to prevent them from clustering together and thereby avoid the negative secondary effects associated with such clustering.  These types of business are allowed as a permitted use in certain Commercial Zoning Districts and must conform to the zoning ordinance.

5.     Because of increased administrative costs incurred by the City Clerk’s office and the Community Development Department, the license fees for such establishments must be set in a reasonable amount to offset the cost to the City so that as far as reasonably possible the costs incurred are borne by the businesses and not subsidized by the taxpayers.

6.     To ensure that such regulation are consistent with the laws of the State of Kansas.

(Code 2015)

13-602.       Findings and statements of policy.

A.    The City maintains a system of storm and surface water management facilities including, but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration facilities and other components as well as natural waterways. The stormwater system needs regular maintenance and improvements.

B.    All developed property in the City either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the stormwater system.  The extent of use of the stormwater system by each property is dependent on factors that influence runoff and overland flow, including land use and the amount of impervious surface on the property.

C.    The costs of improving, maintaining, operating and monitoring the stormwater system should be allocated, to the extent practicable, to all developed properties based on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of the property on the stormwater management system.

D.    Management of the stormwater system to protect the public health, safety and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the public to finance stormwater management adequately with a user fee system that is reasonable and equitable so that each user of the system pays to the extent to which the user contributes to the need for it. The City is responsible for the provision of a planned and orderly system for managing and mitigating the effects of development on stormwater and appropriate balancing between development and preservation of the natural environment.  To accomplish these ends, the City desires to create a Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) and Stormwater Utility.

E.     The Stormwater Management Program will also initiate innovative and proactive approaches to stormwater management within the City to address problems in areas of the City that currently are prone to flooding, protect against replication of these types of problems in newly developing areas of the City, and assist in meeting the mandates of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) as created by the Federal Clean Water Act and associated state and federal laws and their supporting regulations.

F.     The Stormwater Utility Fee imposed by this Article is neither a tax nor a special assessment, but a charge (in the nature of tolls, fees or rents) for services rendered or available.

(Code 2015)

13-603.       Establishment of stormwater management program and stormwater utility.

Pursuant to this Article, Chapter 14, the City’s general home rule authority, its nuisance abatement authority, its police powers and all other authority, the governing body does hereby establish both a Stormwater Management Program and a Stormwater Utility and hereby declares its intention to operate the same.

(Code 2015)

13-604.       Administration of the stormwater management program.

Under the Stormwater Utility, the City Manager or his/her designee shall have the power to undertake the following activities to administer the Stormwater Management Program:

A.    To advise the governing body on matters relating to the Stormwater Management Program and to make recommendations to the governing body concerning the adoption of ordinances, resolutions, policies and regulations in furtherance of the objectives of the Stormwater Management Program.

B.    The acquisition by gift, purchase or eminent domain of real property, easements thereon and/or interests therein necessary to construct, operate and maintain stormwater management facilities.

C.    To undertake the engineering and design, debt service and related financing expenses, construction costs for new facilities and enlargement or improvement of existing facilities, operation and maintenance of the stormwater system.

D.    Regulate, establish standards, review and inspect land use or property owner activities when such activities have the potential to affect the quantity, timing, velocity, erosive forces, quality, environmental value or other characteristics of stormwater which would flow into the stormwater management system or in any way affect the implementation of the Stormwater Management Program.

E.     Monitoring, sampling and inspection of stormwater management facilities.

F.     Water quality monitoring and water quality programs.

G.    Retrofitting developed areas for pollution control.

H.    Inspection and enforcement activities.

I.      Analyze the cost of services and benefits provided by the Stormwater Utility and the structure of fees, service charges, credits and other revenues on a regular basis and make recommendations to the governing body regarding the same.

J.     To undertake expenditures as required to implement these activities, including costs of capital improvements, operations, maintenance and other costs as may be required.

K.    Other activities, which are reasonably required.

(Code 2015)

13-605.       Classification of property for purposes of determining the stormwater utility fee.

For purposes of determining the Stormwater Utility Fee, all properties in the City are classified into one of the following classes:

A.    Residential property.

1.     Residential Fee.  The Commission has determined that a flat Stormwater Utility Fee shall be charged against all residential properties classified as a dwelling unit.  The Commission reserves the right to amend or adjust this Stormwater Utility Fee or to establish a formula for calculating the Stormwater Utility Fee at any time.

2.     The Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) is hereby established for purposes of calculating the Stormwater Utility User Fee.  The ERU is hereby established to be 2,600square feet of Impervious Area.

3.     The initial ERU rate to be used for calculating the Stormwater Utility Fee per ERU shall be established by resolution, with recommended revisions set by resolution of the governing body.  The Stormwater Utility User Fee for residential property shall be the ERU rate multiplied by the number of individual dwelling units existing on the property.

a.     Multiple Water Meter Residential:  the charge for each water customer shall be the ERU multiplier times the ERU rate.

b.     Master Water Meter Residential: the charge for the single water customer shall be the ERU rate multiplied by one (1).

B.    Non-residential Property.

1.     For non-residential property, the charge shall be the ERU rate times the square footage of all impervious area of the property divided by 2,600 square feet.  Non-residential properties with shared impervious area shall be charged on a proportionate amount as determined by the City Manager.

2.     Properties less than 2,600 square feet shall be defined as 1 ERU and assessed a minimum stormwater utility fee.

C.    Undeveloped Property.

1.     There shall be no fee for undeveloped property.

(Code 2015)

13-606.       Stormwater utility fee.

A monthly service charge is imposed upon all developed property, not including exempt property as defined in 13-601, in the City to fund Stormwater Management Programs. The amount of the fee will be established by resolution and shall be implemented as stated in the resolution.

Thereafter, the monthly service charge shall be calculated annually on January 1 and monthly during the following 12-month period. This service charge shall be known as the Stormwater Utility Fee (“Fee”). The Fee shall be calculated to ensure adequate revenues to fund the costs of the Stormwater Management Program and to provide for the operation, maintenance and capital improvements of the stormwater system in the City.

The City Manager or his/her designee shall make an annual recommendation to the governing body as to the monthly charge necessary to fulfill the proposed purpose of the Stormwater Management Program.  Any changes in the fee may then be established by resolution of the Governing Body.

(Code 2015)

13-607.       Charges for tax-exempt properties.

The governing body finds that all real property in the City contributes to stormwater runoff and either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the stormwater system.  Therefore, except as otherwise provided in Section 13-601, all developed property in the City, including property that is exempt from property tax shall be charged the appropriate Stormwater Utility Fee.

(Code 2015)

13-608.       When stormwater utility fee payable; failure to pay; vacant improved property; lien on real property.

The Stormwater Utility Fee shall become part of the monthly water bill sent to utility customers, paid in accordance with Chapter 14, Article 2, Water Service.  Any account that is inactive in the utility billing system shall not be charged the Stormwater Utility Fee until the account becomes active.  In the event any person, shall fail to pay the user charges when due, water service shall be terminated as provided in section Chapter 14, Article 2 of Municipal Code of the City of Ottawa, Kansas.

In the event a developed or improved non-residential property is vacant, and does not have an active water account for more than 30 days, the Stormwater Utility fee assigned to the property in question may be billed directly to the property owner.  If the direct billing is not paid after 60 days of being issued, the finance office will have authority to place a lien on the same commercial property for the amount(s) billed.

(Code 2015)

13-609.       Requests for appeal or correction of the stormwater utility fee.

A customer/property owner may request an appeal or correction of the fee by submitting the request in writing to the Director of Finance (or his/her designee) within thirty (30) days after the issue date of the contested bill.  Grounds for appeal or correction of the fee include:

A.    Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of determining the fee; and

B.    Errors in the identification of the property subject to the fee.

The Director of Finance shall make a determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the customer/property owner’s completed written request for appeal or correction of the fee.  The Director’s decision on a request for appeal or correction of the fee shall be final.  A customer/property owner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by the City when submitting a request for appeal or correction of the fee and must provide all information necessary for the Director to make a determination on a request for correction of the fee.  The burden of proof shall be on the customer/property owner to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the determination of the Director, from which the appeal is being taken, is erroneous. The Director shall notify the customer/property owner in writing of the decision. Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection shall be grounds for denial of the request. The filing of a notice of appeal shall not stay the imposition or duty to pay the fee. If the Director determines that the fee should not be paid or the amount is less than the amount appealed, the City shall issue a refund in the appropriate amount to the customer/property owner. All refunds shall be without interest.

(Code 2015)

13-610.       Rules and regulations, authority to promulgate.

The City Manager or his/her designee shall promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as may from time to time be necessary to properly conduct and administer the operation of the stormwater management system.  Violations of such rules and regulations will be punishable as provided in this Article.  Fees for insufficient fund checks or other uncollectible instruments of payment may be established from time to time.

(Code 2015)

13-611.       Right of entry and inspection.

The City Manager or his/her designee shall have access to any premises within the City’s stormwater management program area, and shall have authority to direct compliance with the provisions of this Article and with the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the authority set forth in this Article.

(Code 2015)

13-612.       Failure to comply with article and rules; duty of director; discontinuance of service; prosecution.

If the City Manager or his/her designee shall discover, upon any premises served by the stormwater management program, any violation of this Article, or of any rule or regulation promulgated there under, the City Manager or his/her designee shall order cessation of the prohibited practice or discontinue service to the premises or both, and s/he may request the City Attorney to prosecute the offending customer/property owner.

(Code 2015)

13-613.       Time for payment; late payment fee.

Each customer shall make payment of the amount shown on his/her statement to be due at the Office of the Department of Utilities in City Hall during regular hours on or before the due date or within fifteen (15) days thereafter; provided, that if the due date is the twenty-fifth (25th) day of a calendar month, payment may be on or before the tenth (10th) day of the calendar month following.  If the amount due is not paid within said time, the account shall be classified as delinquent and shall therefore have a late payment fee consisting of the greater of ten dollars ($10.00) or ten percent (10%) of the billed amount.

(Code 2015)

13-614.       Unpaid and delinquent utility bills, costs of collection.

After authorization by the City Manager, on any collection action filed by the City Attorney or any attorney acting on behalf of the City of Ottawa, for an unpaid and delinquent stormwater utility bill, the City hereby authorizes the said attorney to include as the costs of the action the reasonable collection costs, including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees necessary there under, as a lawful damage to be sought by the City Attorney in any collection.

(Code 2015)

13-615.       Stormwater utility fee credits.

The Governing Body may, by resolution, establish a system of credits for best management practices (BMPs) that assist in minimizing site-specific stormwater runoff and/or reducing site pollutants in stormwater runoff or any other similar BMP measure. This credit may reduce the Stormwater Utility Fee that is imposed in Section 13-605.

(Code 2015)

Article VII. Impact Fee Policy

13-701.       Purpose.

The City of Ottawa encourages the development of each part of the City to its highest and best use for the maximum benefit of all citizens. The use of impact fees helps properly assess the costs of necessary infrastructure between the city at large and those specific properties which may derive a direct benefit. There are times that the use of impact fees is more desirable to the City than using the Kansas General Improvement and Assessment Law (K.S.A. 12-6a01 et seq.). However, the use of impact fees should be governed by a set policy adopted by the governing body to ensure consistency and fairness for all under the law.

A.    Purpose.  In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Ottawa, this chapter is enacted for the general purpose of assuring the proper balance between the use of land and the preservation of a safe and beneficial environment.  More specifically, the provisions of these regulations, as they may be amended from time to time, are intended to reduce property and environmental damage and to minimize the excessive impact of hazardous substances and sediment on the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4).

B.    Objectives.  These impacts shall be minimized by the following minimum control measures:

1.     To maintain and improve the quality of water impacted by the storm drainage system within the City of Ottawa;

2.     To prevent the discharge of contaminated stormwater runoff and illicit discharges from industrial, commercial, residential, and construction sites into the storm drainage system within the City of Ottawa;

3.     To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of sediment, trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, and other pollutants into the storm drainage system;

4.     To encourage recycling of used motor oil and safe disposal of other hazardous consumer products;

5.     To enable the City of Ottawa to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting requirements for stormwater discharges; and

6.     To establish the legal authority to carry out all inspections, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Chapter.

(Code 2015)

14-102.       Chapter general provisions.

A.    Authority.  These regulations are adopted pursuant to the power and authority vested through relevant statutory enabling provisions and other applicable laws and statutes of the State of Kansas and Constitution of Kansas.

B.    Applicability.  This Chapter shall apply to all land, existing or proposed development, waters or substances entering the MS4 within the City, generated from any developed and/or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by subsequent Articles or an authorized enforcement agency.

1.     The requirements of this Chapter shall not apply, unless superseded by State or Federal regulation, to:

a)     Site plans which were approved by Planning Commission prior to July 1, 2011; and

b)     Redevelopment projects that consist solely of ordinary maintenance activities, remodeling of buildings on the existing foundation, resurfacing (milling and overlay) of existing paved areas, and building exterior changes or improvements.

C.    Administration.  The City of Ottawa shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this Chapter.  The City Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority to adopt regulations, policies and procedures as necessary for the enforcement of this Chapter.  Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the authorized enforcement agency may be delegated to persons or entities acting in the employ of the City.

D.    Amendment.  For the purpose of providing the public health, safety and general welfare, the governing body may, from time to time, amend the provisions of these regulations.

E.     Severability.  If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase in this Chapter or any part thereof is held to be unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Chapter.

F.     Right of Entry.  Whenever the City has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises, any condition which constitutes a violation of any portion of this Chapter, the City Manager or his/her designee is authorized to enter the premises at reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this Chapter.  Dischargers shall allow ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, copying, and for the performance of any additional duties.

(Code 2015)

14-103.       Legal provisions.

A.    Interpretations.  The provisions of this Chapter are intended to supplement existing codes, including zoning and land use ordinances of the City.  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of public health, safety and general welfare.

B.    Conflict with Public and Private Provisions.  These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, stature, easement, covenant, any other private agreement or other provision of law.  Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation or other provision of the law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.

C.    Other Laws.  Neither this Chapter nor any administrative decision made under it exempts the permit holder or any other person from other requirements of this code, state and federal laws, or from procuring other required permits, including any state or federal stormwater permits authorized under the NPDES, or limits the right of any person to maintain, at any time, any appropriate action at law or in equity, for relief  or damages against the permit holder or any person arising from the activity regulated by this  Chapter.

3.     SWP2 Plan Amendments.  The owner shall amend the SWP2 Plan whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWP2 Plan, or if the SWP2 Plan proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges.

C.    Owner and Contractor Responsibilities

1.     Contractor Schedule.  The contractor shall provide a detailed schedule of work prior to construction activities, which shall include information on timing, duration, and sequencing of erosion and sediment control measures and construction phasing. Once approved, such schedule shall become a part of the SWP2 Plan, and changes to the schedule shall require amendment to the SWP2 Plan.

2.     Contractor Responsibilities.  Any and all contractors working on a site subject to an NPDES permit shall be responsible for their own activities to ensure that they comply with the owner’s SWP2 Plan.  Failure to comply with the SWP2 Plan or malicious destruction of BMP devices is hereby deemed a violation of this Chapter.

3.     Inspections by Owner Required.  Qualified personnel (as defined by KDHE) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every fourteen (14) calendar days and within twenty-four (24) hours of the end of the storm that produces 1/2”(one-half) inch or greater of precipitation.  Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.  Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP2 Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4.  Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of tracking sediment off-site onto adjacent roads and/or properties.

a)     SWP2 Plan to be Revised as Appropriate.  Based on the results of the inspections required by the above subsection, the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWP2 Plan shall be revised as appropriate.  Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWP2 Plan within ten calendar days following the inspection.

b)     Documentation of Required Inspections.  Any and all inspections made shall be documented.  Documentation shall include the name(s) and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, effectiveness and, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP2 Plan, and any actions taken as a result of the inspection to correct deficiencies and listing of areas where construction operations have permanently or temporarily stopped. Any instance(s) of non-compliance identified during the inspection shall be included in the documentation. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector.  Where an inspection does not identify any non-compliance, the person responsible for making the inspection shall certify by signature that the facility is in compliance with the SWP2 Plan, the NPDES permit, and this Chapter.

c)     Documents to be Retained.  The owner shall retain copies of any SWP2 Plan and all inspection reports required by this chapter or by the NPDES permit for the site, and records of all data used to complete the NOI for a period of at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized and provide all documentation to the City at the conclusion of the project construction.

4.     Duration of Owner/Contractor Responsibility.  The owner/contractor is responsible for water pollution control and permit compliance from the issuance of Notice to Proceed until final completion of the work and during any subsequent maintenance bond period.  The contractor will be released from responsibility for erosion and sediment control for any portion of the job for which a Notice of Termination (NOT) has been submitted and accepted by the local permit authority, provided that the contractor does not subsequently do work in such areas that create new disturbances. The NOT will not be submitted by the owner until all permit requirements are met, which includes the requirement that final stabilization be achieved. Vegetation must have a density of at least 70% of the density of the undisturbed areas of the site.

In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Ottawa, this Article acts to regulate and control the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development and its BMPs from activities that disturb or break the topsoil or result in the significant movement of earth.

(Code 2015)

14-302.       General provisions.

A.    Any person undertaking land disturbance activities, including the clearing, grading, excavating, filling, storing, and disposing of soil and earth materials, shall comply with the requirements and standards set forth in this Article.  Permit requirements for land disturbance activities are described in Section 14-303 of this Article.

B.    Responsible Person(s).  The responsible person(s) are the owner of the property upon which a land disturbance takes place and any person(s) performing a land disturbance activity. When a Land Disturbance Permit or Building Permit is issued, an owner is responsible for land disturbance activities from permit issuance to closure, unless the City approves a transfer of responsibility to a new owner when land is sold.  When land disturbance is authorized through the issuance of a permit pursuant to the Building Code, the owner remains responsible until that permit is closed and any open Land Disturbance Permits on the same property are closed according to Section 14-303(F).

(Code 2015; Ord. 4025-19)

14-303.       Land disturbance activities and permits.

A.    When required. A land disturbance permit (LDP) shall be obtained from the City prior to commencement of any of the following, unless exempted in 14-303(B):

1.     Any activity that changes the physical conditions of landform, vegetation and hydrology, creates bare soil, or otherwise may cause erosion or sedimentation. Such activities include, but are not limited to, clearing, removal of vegetation, stripping, grading, grubbing, excavating, filling, logging and storing of materials.

2.     Any new development or redevelopment that cumulatively disturbs equal to one (1) acre or more of land and must complete a SWP2 Plan in accordance with Section 14-108. 

3.     Utility construction.

B.    Exemptions.  A Land Disturbance Permit is not required for the following:

1.     Residential land disturbance activities that cumulatively disturb less than one (1) acre and are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale that disturbs a cumulative area of 1 acre or more.  Residential projects less than one (1) acre shall implement effective erosion and sediment control techniques in accordance with City BMP standards.

2.     Work to correct or remedy emergencies, including situations that pose an immediate danger to life or property or substantial flood or fire hazards.

3.     Agricultural uses and nursery operations.

4.     Land disturbance activities specifically authorized by a building permit that includes an erosion and sediment control plan covering the entire area of disturbance.  This exemption is not intended to exempt the building permit from erosion and sediment control requirements provided by Section 14-306.

5.     Land disturbance activities in the Special Flood Hazard Area shall adhere to the City of Ottawa Zoning Regulations, Article 19.

6.     Linear utility projects with less than 1,000 feet of cumulative open trench construction that are located outside the boundaries of a development project.

C.    Limitations of usage.  Construction of a project with a final development plan approved by the City also requires a building permit. Construction of a project with a final development plan cannot be accomplished solely through a land disturbance permit.

D.    Applications.

1.     Applications for land disturbance, site plan approval, or building permits shall be filed upon forms prescribed by the City and conform to the following:

a)     Construction documents shall clearly indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this Article, and other relevant laws, rules and regulations as determined by the City Engineer; and

b)     Shall include a site plan drawn to an engineer scale showing the size and location of new construction and existing structures on the site and the legal description of the lot tract or parcel; and

c)     Shall include a grading plan, drainage map, and an erosion and sediment control plan in conformance with Section 14-306.

2.     Applications for land disturbance permits shall be submitted for approval by the City.  Issuance of land disturbance permits shall conform to the following:

a)     Where the proposed land disturbance activity covers multiple tracts of land or multiple lots, the permit shall be issued only to the common owner.

b)     A contact person or field representative shall be identified on every permit as a responsible party whom the City can contact regarding the installation, maintenance, and removal of erosion and sediment control measures.  The land disturbance permit holder is responsible for timely written notification to the City Manager of any changes to the contact person or field representative. 

c)     The land disturbance permit holder may request that the permit be transferred to another party.  The transfer of a permit from one party to another shall be subject to the approval of the City Manager and not be effective until written approval is issued.

d)     The owner of the property may designate, in writing, others to act on his or her behalf, however the responsibility for compliance with this Article with respect to land disturbance activities shall remain with the owner of the property until the issued permit has been officially closed.

E.     Fees.  Application fees for all permit applications shall be established by resolution of the Governing Body.  Application fees may be reviewed on an annual basis and revised as necessary by adoption of a new resolution.

F.     Closure.  Closure of a land disturbance permit is independent of closure of other permits.

1.     Stabilized Site.  The site shall be considered stabilized when perennial vegetation, pavement, buildings or structures using permanent materials, cover all areas that have been disturbed.  Perennial vegetation shall be considered established and completed for stabilization when it has established a healthy and growing stand with a density of at least 70 percent of undisturbed areas at the site.

2.     Partially Stabilized Site.  If a site has been partially stabilized, a land disturbance permit shall be closed upon issuance of a subsequent land disturbance permit covering remaining unstabilized areas.  Closure of a land disturbance permit shall be completed by obtaining a satisfactory final inspection and issuance of a certificate of compliance.  Timing of final inspections for land disturbance permits shall conform to the following:

a)     For phased residential development, where the permit holder seeks closure of the entire site subject to the permit, a final inspection can be completed after 80 percent of the housing units in the associated final plat have received final certificates of occupancy, or a minimum of three years after issuance of the first building permit for a housing unit.  Additionally, no final inspection can be made before any temporary BMP’s serving more than one lot are no longer needed and are removed.

b)     For development other than phased residential development, a final inspection can occur when all temporary BMPs serving more than one lot are no longer needed and are removed.

c)     For single-family or two-family construction only, the holder of a land disturbance permit that includes multiple lots shall no longer be responsible for activities that occur on an individual lot for which all dwellings have received certificates of occupancy. In that event there shall be a final inspection of that lot and partial closure of the land disturbance permit prior to or at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

(Code 2015; Ord 4025-19)

14-304.       Expiration, suspension and revocation of permits.

A.    Expiration of Permits.  Land disturbance permits shall expire if the authorized work has not commenced within 180 days after permit issuance. A land disturbance permit shall not expire after land disturbance activities have begun but shall be closed according to Section 14-303(F).

B.    Suspension of Permits.  Suspension of land disturbance permits shall comply with the following:

1.     A land disturbance permit can be suspended by the City if determined that:

a)     The site is not in substantial compliance with the approved plan or any permit condition.

b)     A violation of any provision of this Article or any other applicable law, Article, rule, or regulation relating to this work exists.

c)     A condition exists, or act is being done that constitutes a nuisance or hazard or endangers human life or the property of others.

d)     The approved plan is failing to achieve required erosion and sediment control objectives due to improper installation, maintenance, or failure of the plan to perform anticipated erosion and sediment control functions as required by Section 14-305.

2.     A land disturbance permit shall be suspended by issuance of written notice to the permit holder, or the permit holder’s representative.  The notice shall indicate the reason for permit suspension and indicate corrective measures required and the timeframe within which corrections must be made to reinstate the permit.  The notice shall also include a stop work order according to Section 14-104(C)(1), if not previously issued.  If the applicant fails to make corrective measures within the timeframe required, the City Manager may revoke the permit.

C.    Revocation of Permits.  A permit may be revoked by the City issuing the permit at any time prior to the completion of the land disturbance when it appears that one or more of the following conditions is present:

1.     There is departure from the plans, specifications or conditions as required under the terms of the permit;

2.     The permit was procured by false representation;

3.     The permit was issued by mistake; or

4.     Any of the provisions of this Article are being violated.

Written notice of such revocation shall be served upon the owner, the owner’s agent or contractor, or upon any person employed in the building or structure for which such permit was issued, or shall be posted in a prominent location on the property.  Where notice of revocation has been served or posted, no further construction or use of the property shall proceed.  Any revocation of a permit other than a building permit may be appealed to the Governing Body.  A revoked permit may not be reinstated, except where revocation of a building permit is successfully appealed to the Construction Board of Appeals.

(Code 2015; Ord. 4025-19)

14-305.       Other permits.

A.    Building Permits and Compliance

1.     Compliance with existing land disturbance permits.  Issuance of any building permit that is part of a common plan of development with a pre-existing land disturbance permit, will require written agreement by the permit applicant to comply with the provisions of the pre-existing land disturbance permit.

2.     Closure.  Closure of a building permit shall be completed in accordance with the provisions of Section 14-303(F).  In cases where there is not a separate land disturbance permit issued for a particular site, a final certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until the site has been permanently stabilized and all temporary BMP’s removed and all drainage and grading is found to be in compliance with this Article.

B.    General Permit for Franchised/Public Utilities.  In lieu of obtaining individual project Land Disturbance Permits for utility-funded linear projects, the City may issue a General Permit to franchise and public utilities that shall be renewed annually.  To apply for a General Permit, the utility must submit a permit application which includes:

1.     Effective erosion control standards and construction methods that are to be implemented on the utility’s projects, conforming to Section 14-305.  The General Permit does not relieve the utility of the responsibility of preparing and implementing project specific SWP3, as defined by the State of Kansas, for projects disturbing over one (1) acre of area.

2.     A procedure to notify the City, no less than fourteen (14) days prior to work beginning, of projects disturbing a cumulative area greater than one (1) acre. The notification shall be accompanied by a copy of SWP3 and the associated KDHE NOI.

3.     A mechanism to reimburse the City for the cost of all abatement actions.  The City Manager may revoke a Land Disturbance General Permit for failure to reimburse City abatement costs within sixty (60) days of receipt of an abatement invoice. The utility must notify the City Manager in writing within fourteen (14) days of any State or Federal citations related to erosion and sediment control violations in the City.

4.     The City Manager shall revoke any general permit when the activities authorized by that General Permit cause the City of Ottawa to be noncompliant with the NPDES permit.

14-306.       Erosion and sediment control plans.

A.    All proposed land disturbance activity that requires a permit in accordance with Section 14-303 shall be depicted on a site-specific Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.  Land disturbance activities that do not require a permit in accordance with Section 14-303(B) are required to employ applicable BMPs included in standard details provided by the City.  For persons not subject to permit requirements, any pollutants or sediment found emanating from a site or parcel may constitute a violation of Article II.

B.    Other Pollutants.  In addition to sediment, the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall provide for the control of other pollutants related to the land disturbance activity that might cause an adverse impact to water quality, including, but not limited to, discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, fuel, hydraulic fluids, chemicals, litter, and sanitary wastes.

C.    Design Requirements.

1.     Where land disturbance activities have temporarily or permanently ceased on a portion of a project site for over fourteen (14) consecutive days, the disturbed areas shall be protected from erosion by stabilizing the areas with mulch or other similarly effective soil stabilizing BMPs.  If seeding or other vegetative erosion control method is used, it shall become established in two (2) weeks or the City may require the site to be reseeded or a non-vegetative option employed, unless the timeframe for compliance is extended by the City Engineer.  Where implementation of stabilization measures is precluded by snow cover, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable.

2.     Cut and fill slopes shall not exceed 3:1, except as approved by the City Engineer to meet other community or environmental objectives.

3.     Erosion and sediment controls shall not obstruct any existing or built drainage ways.

4.     Clearing and grading of natural resources, such as forests and wetlands, shall not be permitted, except as approved by the City Engineer.  Clearing techniques that retain natural vegetation and drainage patterns shall be upon approval of the City Engineer.

5.     Clearing, except that necessary to establish sediment control devices, shall not begin until all sediment control devices have been installed and have been stabilized.

6.     Phasing shall be required on all sites disturbing greater than thirty (30) acres, with the size of each phase to be established at plan review and as approved by the City Engineer.

D.    The Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall include the following:

1.     A natural resources map identifying soils, forest cover, and resources.

2.     A sequence of construction of the development site, including stripping and clearing; rough grading; construction of utilities, infrastructure, and buildings; and final grading and landscaping.  Sequencing shall identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas, areas of clearing, installation of temporary erosion and sediment control measures, and establishment of permanent vegetation.

3.     All erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the objectives of this Article throughout all phases of construction and after completion of development of the site. Depending upon the complexity of the project, the drafting of intermediate plans may be required at the close of each season.

4.     Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer application, and kind and quantity of mulching for both temporary and permanent vegetative control measures.

5.     Provisions for maintenance of control facilities, including easements and estimates of the cost of maintenance.

E.     Modifications to the plan shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as Section 14-108, and shall include:

1.     Major amendments of the erosion and sediment control plan.

2.     Field modifications of a minor nature.

F.     Erosion control requirements shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.     Special techniques for steep slopes or in drainage ways shall be used to ensure stabilization.

2.     Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each workday.

3.     The entire site must be stabilized, using a heavy mulch layer or another method that does not require germination to control erosion, at the close of the construction season.

4.     Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the site.

5.     Techniques that divert upland runoff past disturbed slopes shall be employed.

6.     Sediment control requirements shall include:

a)     Settling basins, sediment traps, or tanks and perimeter controls.

b)     Settling basins that are designed in a manner that allows adaptation to provide long-term stormwater management.

c)     Protection for adjacent properties by the use of a vegetated buffer strip in combination with perimeter controls.

7.     Construction site access requirements shall include:

a)     A temporary access road provided at all sites.

b)     Other measures required by the City Engineer in order to ensure that sediment is not tracked into public streets by construction vehicles or washed into stormwater drains.

Article IV. Post-Construction Management

14-401.       Purpose of article.

A.    Purpose.  In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Ottawa, the purpose of this Article shall be to establish post-construction minimum stormwater management requirements and controls on any new development or redevelopment project(s) with subdivision or site plan applications.

B.    Objectives.  This Article seeks to meet this purpose through the following objectives:

1.     Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce non-point source pollution, siltation, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;

2.     Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality, particularly if receiving bodies are classified as impaired on the most recent version of the 303d listing of impaired waters in Kansas as identified by KDHE;

3.     Reduce stormwater runoff rates, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and to ensure that these BMPs are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.

Within this Article, the term Stormwater Management Facility shall mean BMPs that are implemented or constructed in order to comply with this Article.

(Code 2015; Ord. 4001-18)

14-402.       Waivers and exemptions.

A.    Applicability.  This section is applicable to development and redevelopment projects for commercial, industrial and new residential subdivisions that disturb 1 acre or greater or increase net impervious surfaces by 500 square feet or greater.

B.    Exemptions.  Owners of properties where the following activities are undertaken are exempt from the stated requirements.

1.     Farming activities;

2.     Unplanned emergency work and emergency repairs necessary to protect life or property.

C.    Waivers.  All or some of the required stormwater management facility standards may be waived by the City under the following circumstances:

1.     If it can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this ordinance; or

2.     The City of Ottawa finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of the site; or engineering studies determine that installing a stormwater management facility in order to meet the stormwater management standard(s) will cause adverse impact to water quality, or cause increased channel erosion, or downstream flooding.

(Code 2015; Ord. 4001-18)

14-403.       Design criteria and stormwater design plans.

A.    Technical Specifications and Design Criteria

Whereas, the State of Kansas has passed legislation, known as the Kansas Water Pollution Act, K.S.A. 12-3101 et seq. ( KWPA) which has been found by the Kansas Supreme Court to be a non-uniform legislative act that affects different classes of cities in the State in different manners; and

Whereas, the KWPA also has a provision that allows the Secretary of the KDHE to, by resolution, allow cities to create their own storm water utility; and

Whereas, the Kansas Legislature has not created, in the KWPA the authority for the KDHE to issue resolutions, and KDHE has taken the position that it does not have the authority to issue resolutions allowing cities to create a storm water utility under the KWPA; and

Whereas, various cities have used their Constitutional Charter Ordinance authority to exempt themselves from the provisions of the KWPA, and the Kansas Supreme Court has determined, on a number of occasions, that the KWPA is not uniform as it applies to all cities in the State; and

Whereas, the City of Ottawa seeks to create a storm water utility for the purpose of managing storm water in the city and to collect of fee for that sole purpose, and to manage, administer and enforce such regulations as promulgated by the City of Ottawa for that purpose;

Now, Therefore Be it Ordained by the Governing Body of the City of Ottawa, Kansas, that:

Section 1. Exemption from State law.

Section 2. Repeal of inconsistent provisions. Any provision of the current ordinances of the City of Ottawa that are inconsistent or in conflict with this Charter Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict; otherwise all such provisions are hereby ratified and confirmed.

“Settlement Prices” shall mean the settlement prices for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month as published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), or other nationally recognized publication, on the following business day (or the next day in which a Settlement Price is published).

“Transportation Consumer” shall mean without limitation, any Entity that transports “Transport Gas” within the Corporate City limits through Grantee’s Distribution Facilities for consumption within the City’s corporate limits.

“Transport Gas” shall mean all natural gas transported by the Grantee, or by others, but not sold by the Grantee, to any consumer within the City through the Distribution Facilities of the Grantee.

“Volumetric Rate” shall mean $.1733 (5%); MCF for Transport Gas distributed to Transportation Consumers.  The Volumetric Rate shall be subject to adjustment and recalculation in the future in accordance with the provisions set forth below.  The Volumetric Rate Calculation form incorporated herein and attached hereto as Attachment A shall be used for recalculating the Volumetric Rate.  There shall be an annual recalculation of the Volumetric Rate which shall be effective each January 1.  The recalculation shall be based on Settlement Prices for the twelve (12) month period beginning in July of the second (2nd) preceding year and ending in June of the preceding year.  For the fifteen (15th) day of each month during said twelve (12) month period, the Settlement Prices for natural gas for the next twelve (12) months will be summed and divided by twelve (12) to determine an average Settlement Price.  The average Settlement Prices for each of the twelve (12) months shall then be summed and divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by 5 percent (5%) to obtain the Volumetric Rate to be effective January 1 of the next succeeding year.  The Volumetric Rates shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures set out herein and filed with the City Clerk by July 31 of each year for those rates to be effective on January 1 of the following year.  

SECTION 2.          Grant of Franchise:

That in consideration of the benefits to be derived by the City and its inhabitants, there is hereby granted to Grantee the right, privilege, and authority for the full term of this Franchise Ordinance, the non-exclusive right, privilege and franchise to occupy and use the Right-of-Way of the City, for the placing and maintaining of Distribution Facilities necessary to carry on the business of  distributing natural gas for all purposes to the City, and its inhabitants, and through said City and beyond the limits thereof; to obtain said natural gas from any source available; and to do all things necessary or proper to carry on said business.

SECTION 3:  Term and Re-opener Provisions.

A.    The term of this Franchise shall be ten (10) years from the effective date of this Franchise Ordinance.

B.    Upon written request of either the City or the Grantee, this Franchise may be reopened and reviewed after five (5) years from the effective date and every five (5) years from the effective date of this Franchise Ordinance and either the City or the Grantee may propose amendments to any provision of this Franchise by giving sixty (60) days written notice to the other of the amendment(s) desired.  The City and the Grantee shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a mutually satisfactory amendment(s).

C.    Upon written request of either the City or the Grantee, the Franchise Ordinance shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time upon any of the following events:

1.     Change in federal, state, or local law, regulation, or order, which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or the Grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the grant to the Grantee or the compensation to be received by the City;

2.     Change in the structure or operation of the natural gas industry which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or the Grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the grant to the Grantee or the compensation to be received by the City:

D.    Upon written request by the Grantee to the City, the compensation provisions of this Franchise Ordinance shall be reopened and renegotiated if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy which use the Right-of-Way and/or easements granted on publicly owned property and pay a franchise fee or other payment which results in a material or economic disadvantage to the Grantee.  Upon written request by the Grantee to the City, the compensation provisions of this Franchise Ordinance and the use of the Right-of-Way provisions of this Franchise Ordinance shall be reopened and renegotiated if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy which use the Right-of-Way and do not have requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way substantially equivalent to the requirements of this Franchise Ordinance, which results in a material or economic disadvantage to the Grantee.  Upon any such event, the City shall have up to ninety (90) days after written request of the Grantee to restore competitive neutrality. Following notice to the City, Grantee may suspend collection and payment of the franchise fee to the City for the affected customers until the City resolves the competitive disadvantage.  After the last above referred ninety (90) day period expires without resolution of the competitive disadvantage, the Grantee shall have no liability to the City for any uncollected franchise fees suspended as provided in this subsection.

E.     Amendments under this Section, if any, shall be made by ordinance as prescribed by statute.  This Franchise Ordinance shall remain in effect according to its terms pending completion of any review or renegotiation pursuant to this Section.

SECTION 4:  Compensation to the City.

In consideration of and as compensation for the Franchise hereby granted to the Grantee by the City, the Grantee shall make an accounting to the City of all natural gas that has been “Distributed” within the City on a monthly basis. The Grantee shall pay the City as compensation:

A.    A sum equal to five (5%) of the Gross Receipts received by Grantee from the Grantee’s Distribution of natural gas to Sales and Transportation Consumers; plus

B.    A sum equal to the Volumetric Rate multiplied by the number of MCF of Transport Gas for the distribution of Transport Gas for Transportation Consumers.

The sums in A above shall be collected from Sales Consumers and the sums in A and B above shall be collected from Transportation Consumers and shall be adjusted for uncollectible receivables and for uncollectible receivables which are later collected.

Payments of the compensation above shall commence with the first cycle of the monthly billing cycle which begins in July 2016. Prior to that date, payments shall continue to be calculated and be paid in the manner previously provided in Ordinance Nos. 3575-06 and 3576-06 and amendments thereto.  Such payments shall be made on or before the last day of each month and shall be based upon such Gross Receipts charges and collected for the preceding month.

The payments and compensation herein provided shall be in lieu of all other licenses, taxes, charges, and fees, except that the usual general property taxes and special ad valorem property assessments, sales, and excise taxes or charges made for privileges which are not connected with the natural gas business, will be imposed on the Grantee and are not covered by the payments herein.  From and after the date hereof, however, the permit fees required of the Grantee by any ordinance presently in effect or hereafter adopted for a permit to excavate in or adjacent to any street, alley, or other public place shall be deemed a part of the compensation paid in this Section 4 and shall not be separately assessed or collected by the City; in no event, however, shall this provision be interpreted to waive the requirement of notice to the City and the procedural requirements of such ordinance.

SECTION 5.  Use of Right-of-Way

A.    The Grantee’s use of the Right of Way granted by the City shall be subject to all rules, regulations and policies now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power.  In addition, the Grantee shall be subject to all  rules, regulations and policies now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to permits, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, and other requirements on the use of the Right of Way; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Grantee to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation or policy proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City and, further provided other than the items enumerated in Section 4 herein, that such rules, regulations or policies shall not require the payment of additional fees or additional costs for the use of the Right of Way.  In any event, the Grantee is granted an offset for such fees and costs against the franchise fees required to be paid hereunder.

B.    All mains, services, and pipe which shall be laid or installed under this grant shall be so located and laid as not to obstruct or interfere with any water pipes, drains, sewers, or other structures already installed.  Grantee shall provide, prior to commencing work, information to the City concerning work to be performed in the streets, avenues, bridges, parks, parking areas, and public places of the City, as the City may from time to time require for purposes of record keeping.  The City may require that the information be provided on its standard permit form, but without requiring approval, consent, or fees.  In the event of an emergency, Grantee shall have the right to commence work without having first providing such form(s).

C.    Grantee shall, in doing the work in connection with its said gas mains, pipes, and services, avoid, so far as may be practicable, interfering with the use of any street, alley, avenue, or other public thoroughfare.  It shall, without expense to the City, and in a manner satisfactory to the duly authorized representatives of the City, replace such paving or surface in substantially as good condition as before said work was commenced.

D.    It is recognized that the natural gas to be delivered hereunder is to be supplied from a pipeline system transporting natural gas from distant sources of supply; and the Grantee, by its acceptance of this Franchise Ordinance as hereinafter provided, does obligate itself to furnish natural gas in such quantity and for such length of time, limited by the terms hereof, as the said sources and said pipelines are reasonably capable of supplying.

E.     Grantee, its successors and assigns, in the construction, maintenance, and operation of its natural gas system, shall use all reasonable and proper precaution to avoid damage or injury to persons and property, and shall hold and save harmless the City from any and all damage, injury, and expense caused by the negligence of said Grantee, its successors and assigns, or its or their agents or servants.

SECTION 6.  Acceptance of Terms by Grantee and Effective Date of Ordinance.

This Franchise Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, approval by the City, acceptance by the Grantee, and publication in the official city newspaper.

Grantee shall have sixty (60) days after the final passage and approval of this Franchise Ordinance to file with the City Clerk its acceptance in writing of the provisions, terms and conditions of this Franchise Ordinance and when so accepted, this Franchise Ordinance and acceptance shall constitute a contract between the City and Grantee and said contract shall be deemed effective on the date Grantee files acceptance with the City.

SECTION 7.  Notice of Property Annexed by City.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Franchise Ordinance, the fees provided for in Section 4 above shall not become effective within any area annexed by the City until the first of the month billing cycle which begins no more than 60 days after the date that the City provides the Grantee with a certified copy of the annexation ordinance, proof of publication as required by law and a map of the City detailing the annexed area.

SECTION 8.          Payment of Costs.

Grantee shall be responsible for payment of all costs and expense of publishing this Franchise Ordinance and any amendments thereof.

SECTION 9. 

This Franchise Ordinance is granted pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 12-2001 and amendments thereto.

SECTION 10.        Actions by the Kansas Corporation Commission.

Should the Kansas Corporation Commission take any action with respect to this Franchise Ordinance and any amendments thereto which precludes Grantee from recovering from its customers any costs or fees provided for hereunder, the parties shall renegotiate this Franchise Ordinance in accordance with the Commission’s ruling.

WHEREAS, the Company is operating a system for the production, transmission and distribution of electric current in the State of Kansas and has heretofore built, or proposes to build, its electric facilities within and through the City of Ottawa, Kansas (herein called the City); and

SECTION I.

(a) In consideration of the benefits to be derived by the City and the inhabitants thereof from the construction, operation and maintenance of an electric light and power system and the supplying of electric energy to the public, there is hereby granted to the Company and to its successors and assigns, for the term of ten (10) years from the effective date hereof (subject to termination as provided for in Section VII, below) a non-exclusive franchise and authority to construct, operate and maintain within the existing and any future extended corporate limits of the City for which the Company now or shall hereafter hold a Certificate of Convenience and Authority from the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas all appropriate facilities and plants for the purpose of supplying electric energy to that specific area of the City to be called the Franchise Area and for the purpose of transmitting power through the City via transmission lines and related facilities and all other operations connected therewith or incident thereto for the purpose of supplying within the Franchise Area electric or other energy in such forms as may be reasonably required for domestic, commercial, industrial, municipal and other purposes and to produce and supply such energy by manufacture, generation, purchase or otherwise, and to transmit and distribute same by means of underground or overhead facilities or otherwise, and for any or all of said purposes it is authorized to (i) construct, install, replace and remove conduits, poles, lamp posts, guys, anchors, wires, cables, street lights and all other related facilities in, on, under, along, across and over all streets, alleys, avenues, bridges, parks, parking and other existing and any future alleys, avenues, bridges, parks, parking and other existing and any future public places or thoroughfares, (ii) construct, erect, maintain and remove all structures, machinery and attachments of any and every kind for any and all said purposes, (iii) enter upon any and all of said public places within the corporate limits of the City as they now exist or may hereafter be opened, widened, extended, laid out and established, including any other territory hereafter added thereto or coming under the City’s jurisdiction, and (iv) to trim trees upon and overhanging such places and make such excavations thereon as may be appropriate for the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, renewal and removal of the Company’s overhead and underground facilities and plants.

(b) The Franchise Area shall consist of those certain properties and the customers thereon contained in Exhibit A to this Agreement. A listing of the legal descriptions of the properties comprising the Franchise Area is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference:

(c) The Company shall not use, or allow any other person or entity to use, its facilities or the City’s right-of-way for any purpose other than the provision of electric power; provided, however, that nothing contained herein is intended to limit or restrict facilities already in place or indirectly related to the provision of electric power, such as Company communications equipment. The Company shall not permit a subsidiary, affiliate, or a third party to acquire rights to occupy the rights-of-way under this franchise, except that the Company may allow the use of its facilities when the City receives prior written notification of such use, and such use is compensated to the City under the provisions of a franchise granted by the city to any such third party.

SECTION II. Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up or any and all excavations made shall be done under the supervision and directions of the governing body of said City under all necessary permits issued for the work, and shall be made and done in such manner as to give the least reasonable inconvenience to the inhabitants of the City and the public generally, and pavements, sidewalks, curbing and excavations shall be replaced and repaired in as good condition as before with all convenient speed, by and at the expense of the Company.

SECTION III. The Company shall at all times during the term of this franchise supply to consumers of electric energy, residing in those portions of the Franchise Area duly certificated to the Company by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas, such electric energy as they may require, and shall extend and construct its lines and services in accordance with legal requirements, and rules and regulations as filed from time to time with the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed as a guarantee upon the part of the Company to furnish uninterrupted service, and interruptions due to Acts of God, fire, strikes, civil or military authority, orders of the court and other causes reasonably beyond the control of the Company are specifically exempted from the terms of this Section. The City shall provide the Company a map of the City’s corporate limits (the “Map”). The Map shall be of sufficient detail to assist Company in determining whether their customers reside within the City’s corporate limits. The Map shall serve as a basis for determining Company’s obligation hereunder to collect and pay the franchise fee from customers; provided, however, that if the City’s corporate limits are changed by annexation or otherwise, it shall be the City’s responsibility to (a) update the Map so that such changes are included therein, and (b) provide the updated Map to the Company.

The Company shall comply with all building, electrical, and zoning codes currently or hereafter in force in the City.

SECTION V. The Company shall, at all times, in the construction, maintenance, and operation of its electric transmission, distribution and street lighting system, use all reasonable and proper precaution to avoid damage or injury to persons or property, and shall hold and save harmless said City from any and all claims, damage, injury and expense caused by the negligence, in whole or in part, of the Company, its successors and assigns.

SECTION VI. As a further consideration for the rights, privileges and franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of all rental, license or occupation taxes for the use of the ways and alleys and streets involved herein, the Company agrees to pay to the City, and the City agrees to accept as adequate compensation and consideration for the Franchise hereby granted five percent (5%) of the total gross receipts charged and collected solely from the sale of electric energy used within the Franchise Area for domestic, commercial and industrial consumption. Any consideration made hereunder shall be reported and paid to the City by the Company on a semiannual basis on each March 31 and September 30 for the years in which this Franchise remains in effect, reflecting such electric energy sold to customers for the six months’ period ending at the last meter reading preceding each February 28 and August 31, respectively.

SECTION VII. The City of Ottawa has the right to terminate this Franchise as of the fifth or succeeding anniversary dates hereof by providing written notice of such termination to the Company at least one hundred twenty (120) days in advance of such anniversary date.

SECTION VIII. The term “gross receipts,” when used in this ordinance shall mean the aggregate amount of all sales and charges from the business of supplying electricity by Company, or any affiliated company, in said municipality during any period less discounts, late payment charges, credits, refunds, sales taxes, uncollectible accounts and payments made pursuant to this agreement.

SECTION IX. All provisions of this Ordinance shall be binding upon the Company and successors and assigns from and after the date of written acceptance hereof by the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, its grantees and its successors and assigns.

SECTION X. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance.

SECTION XI. This Ordinance is made under and in conformity with the laws of the State of Kansas, and shall take effect and be in force as of the first day of the first month after written acceptance by the Company.

by any other provision of these regulations or of any other law, rule or
regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive shall govern
unless otherwise excepted.
3. Private agreements. These regulations are not intended to abrogate, annul
or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant or any other private agreement of legal relationship; provided, however, that where the provisions
of these regulations are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than such easements, covenants or other private agreements or legal relationships, the provisions of these regulations shall govern.
4. Unlawful structures and uses. No structure or use which was not lawfully
existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations shall become or be
made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of these regulations; and to the
extent that, and in any respect that, said unlawful structure or use is in conflict with the requirements of these regulations, said structure or use remains unlawful hereunder.

2-201. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City that the several provisions of these
regulations are separable, in accordance with the following rules:

6-502. Density Requirements for R-1 and R-2 Conditional Use Permits.
a. The following dwelling unit density standards must be met before any application for a conditional use permit under Table 6-1, item 7 Dwellings, may be considered by the Planning Commission.
1. R-1 District Conditional Uses. In the R-1 low-density residential district two- and three-family dwelling units are allowed as conditional uses. To be considered for such a conditional use permit the Zoning Administrator must make the following analysis and reach a finding that the subject property meets the requirements of this section:
(a) All dwelling units on lots on the same block as the subject property and the one-half of the block facing the subject property shall be counted. Only those dwelling units on lots zoned for residential use shall be included in the count. Undeveloped lots zoned R-1 shall be counted as one (1) dwelling unit. Undeveloped lots zoned R-2 shall be counted as two (2) dwelling units.
(b) The number of dwelling units from (a) above shall be divided into the total square footage of the lots included in the count in (a) above.
(c) The resulting calculation of dwelling units/square footage cannot be less than the minimum lot area for single-family dwellings in R-1 in Table 6-2 (7,000 sq. ft.).
(d) In addition to the above requirement, the subject property itself must meet the minimum lot area/dwelling unit as set forth in Table 6-2 (4,500 sq. ft. for both two-family and three-family dwelling units, per unit.
(e) Upon the Zoning Administrator’s finding that density requirements would be met, the application for conditional use permit may then proceed in accordance with Article 26.
2. R-2 District Conditional Use. In the R-2 medium-density residential district four-plus family dwelling units are allowed as a conditional use. To be considered for such a conditional use permit the Zoning Administrator must make the following analysis and

ARTICLE 7
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT (TN)
Sections:
7-1 Intent
7-2 Applicability
7-3 Application Procedure and Approval Process
7-4 Traditional Neighborhood Development Design Standards
7-5 Definitions
SECTION 7-1 INTENT
7-101. The intent of this Article is to allow the optional development and redevelopment of land consistent with the design principles of traditional neighborhoods. A traditional neighborhood has the following characteristics: compact; designed for the human scale; provides a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, public, and open space uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood; provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes; and incorporates a system of relatively narrow interconnected streets with sidewalks and bikeways that offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and provides for the connections of those streets to existing and future development. A traditional neighborhood also: retains existing buildings with historical features or architectural features that enhance the visual character of the community; and incorporates significant environmental factors into the design.
SECTION 7-2 APPLICABILITY
7-201. The Traditional Neighborhood Development regulations are an alternative set of standards for development within the City for development of ten (10) acres or more contiguous to existing development and redevelopment or infill development of five (5) acres or more.
SECTION 7-3 APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND APPROVAL PROCESS
7-301. The application procedure and plan approval process for development within the TN District shall follow the same procedures and processes set out for Planned Unit Developments in Sections 18-4:6 of these regulations.
7-302. Subdivision of Land. If the Traditional Neighborhood Development involves the subdivision of land as defined in the City’s subdivision regulations, the applicant shall submit all required land division documents in accordance with those requirements. If there is a conflict between the design standards of the subdivision regulations and the design guidelines of this Article, the provisions of this Article shall apply.
7-303. Ownership and Maintenance of Public Space. Provisions shall be made for the ownership and maintenance of streets, squares, parks, open space, and other public spaces in a Traditional Neighborhood Development by dedication to the City.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
7-2
Article 7
7-304. Recording of Documents. The following documents shall be filed by the applicant in the Franklin County Register of Deeds Office within 21 calendar days after approval of the documents by the Governing Body; a certified copy of the zoning ordinance amendment designating a tract of land as a Traditional Neighborhood Development; and the final plan.
SECTION 7-4 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS
7-401. Development within the TN District should provide for a mix of the following residential, commercial and public uses:
a. Any permitted or conditional use in the R-1 District.
b. Any permitted use in the C-1 District.
c. Any permitted use in the P District.
Figure 1. Plan-view conceptual diagrams of neighborhood commercial “service areas” (hexagons). Each hexagon represents a neighborhood with a mixed-use center (dot) that is within a five-minute walking distance of the neighborhood’s edge. Clusters of neighborhoods (larger hexagon) can support more extensive commercial development than individual neighborhoods. The appropriate amount of commercial uses within a traditional neighborhood development depends on the location, or community context, of the new development (darker shaded hexagon).

Article 7
Figure 2. Elevation sketch of a typical “streetscape” within a fixed-use area. Architectural design, street furniture, and landscaping all contribute to an attractive, human-scaled environment with a distinct visual character.
Figure 3. Plan-view diagram illustrating the importance of context in planning public open spaces. Large, contiguous open spaces are community-wide resources with environmental, aesthetic, recreational, and educational benefits. Smaller parks and open spaces (asterisk) should be located in neighborhoods (hexagons) that are not within easy walking distance of community parks and open space.
7-402. Development Units. The number of residential dwelling units and the amount of nonresidential development (including open spaces) shall be determined as follows:
1. In areas devoted to mixed residential uses:
a. The number of single-family attached and detached units permitted shall be six (6) dwelling units per net acre;
b. The number of multifamily units shall be twenty (20) dwelling units per net acre;
c. Secondary dwelling units shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this section. However, the total number of secondary dwelling units shall not be more than ten (10) percent of the total number of single-family attached and detached units.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
7-4
Article 7
d. For each affordable housing unit one additional dwelling unit shall be permitted, up to a maximum 15 percent increase in dwelling units.
2. In mixed use areas:
a. The number of single-family and multifamily dwelling units permitted shall be calculated the same as above plus an additional number of units not to exceed 10 percent of the amount permitted above.
b. All dwelling units constructed above commercial uses shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this section. However, the total number of dwelling units shall not be increased by more than 10 dwelling units or 10 percent, whichever is greater.
c. The total ground floor area of nonresidential development uses, including off-street parking areas, shall not exceed 25 percent of the Traditional Neighborhood Development.
7-403. Open Space. At least ten (10) percent of the gross acreage of the Traditional Neighborhood Development must be open space. At least 25 percent of the open space must be common open space dedicated to the public for parkland. Ninety (90) percent of the lots within the areas devoted to mixed residential uses shall be within ¼ mile or a five minute walk from common open space.
7-404. Stormwater Management. The design and development of the Traditional Neighborhood Development should minimize off-site stormwater runoff, promote on-site filtration, and minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Natural topography and existing land cover should be maintained/protected to the maximum extent possible. New development and redevelopment shall meet the following requirements:
1. Untreated, directed stormwater discharges to wetlands or surface waters are not allowed.
2. Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to remove 80 percent of the average annual load of total suspended solids.
3. All treatment systems must have operation and maintenance plans to ensure that systems function as designed.
7-405. Lot and Block Standards.
1. Block and Lot Size Diversity. Street layouts should provide for perimeter blocks that are generally in the range of 200-400 feet deep by 400-800 feet long. A variety of lot sizes should be provided to facilitate housing diversity and choice and meet the projected requirements of people with different housing needs.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
7-5
Article 7
Figure 4. Plan-view diagram of a street grid showing a diversity of lot (parcel) size.
2. Lot Widths. Lot widths should create a relatively symmetrical street cross section that reinforces the public space of the street as a simple, unified public space.
3. Building Setbacks, Front – Mixed Use Area. Structures in the mixed use area have no minimum setback. Commercial and civic or institutional buildings should abut the sidewalks in the mixed use area.
Figure 5. Plan-view diagrams showing two alternatives for building setbacks from the street right-of-way in mixed-use areas. Relatively uniform setbacks (a) are preferable to widely varying building setbacks (b).
4. Building Setback, Front – Areas of Mixed Residential Uses. Single-family detached residences shall have a building setback in the front between five (5) and twenty (20) feet. Single-family attached residences and multifamily residences shall have a building setback in the front between 0 and 15 feet.
5. Building Setback, Rear – Areas of Mixed Residential Uses. The principal building on lots devoted to single-family detached residences shall be setback no less than twenty-five (25) feet from the rear lot line.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
7-6
Article 7
6. Side Setbacks. Provision for zero lot-line single-family dwellings should be made, provided that a reciprocal access easement is recorded for both lots and townhouses or other attached dwellings, provided that all dwellings have pedestrian access to the rear yard through means other than the principal structure.
Figure 6. Plan-view diagram of the “zero-lot line” concept. A large side-yard on each parcel is created by uniformly eliminating one of the side-yard setbacks.
7-406. Circulation Standards. The circulation system shall allow for different modes of transportation. The circulation system shall provide functional and visual links within the residential areas, mixed use area, and open space of the Traditional Neighborhood Development shall be connected to existing and proposed external development. The circulation system shall provide adequate traffic capacity, provide connected pedestrian and bicycle routes (especially off street bicycle or multi-use paths or bicycle lanes on the streets), control through traffic, limit lot access to streets of lower traffic volumes, and promote safe and efficient mobility through the traditional neighborhood development.
a. Pedestrian Circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation systems that minimize pedestrian-motor vehicle conflicts shall be provided continuously throughout the Traditional Neighborhood Development. Where feasible, any existing pedestrian routes through the site shall be preserved and enhanced. All streets, except for alleys, may, at the City’s request, be bordered by sidewalks on both sides. The following provisions also apply:
1. Sidewalks in Residential Areas. Clear and well-lighted sidewalks, a minimum of four (4) feet in width, depending on projected pedestrian traffic, shall connect all dwelling entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk.
2. Sidewalks in Mixed Use Areas. Clear and well-lighted walkways shall connect building entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk and to associated parking areas. Such walkways shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width.
b. Bicycle Circulation. Bicycle circulation shall be accommodated on streets and/or on dedicated bicycle paths. Facilities for bicycle travel may include off-street bicycle paths (generally shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized users) and separate, striped, 4 foot bicycle lanes on streets. If a bicycle lane is combined with a lane for parking, the combined width should be 14 feet.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
7-7
Article 7
c. Motor Vehicle Circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic calming features such as “queuing streets,” curb extensions, traffic circles, and medians may be used to encourage slow traffic speeds.

SECTION 8-1 INTENT
8-101. The “CS” Countryside District is intended to reduce the number of nonconforming properties, both undeveloped and developed, which would otherwise result from the application of these regulations to newly-annexed property. The CS district will provide a rural residential lifestyle where residents have adequate open space by which to preserve that character even after the area becomes fully developed in accordance with this Article. The district will allow for limited future single-family residential development without encouraging the premature loss of open space or the loss of land used for agricultural purposes. Development in rural areas is encouraged to utilize cluster subdivisions methods to allow density in the future when infrastructure becomes available. 8-102. Following the effective date of these Regulations, to be eligible for zoning classification as Countryside, land should be at least twenty (20) acres in area. Land which does not itself meet the above criteria, but which is surrounded by sections of land zoned Countryside, may also be zoned Countryside. 8-103. New lots shall be created within the Countryside District only if constituting 5 or more acres, as provided in Section 8-5. New lots less than 5 acres may be permitted if developed in accordance with Article 13, Conservation Subdivision Development Standards, of the City’s Subdivision Regulations.

Lot Area: For every lot created after March 1, 2005, the minimum lot area shall be 5 acres with 300 feet or more of frontage on a public road. In cases where unusual lot configuration or dedications for public uses have created a lot of less than 5 acres, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the lot area nonetheless meets the spirit and intent of this requirement. 2. Lot Dimensions: For every lot created after March 1, 2005, the minimum width of a lot shall be 300 feet. The minimum depth of a lot shall be 500 feet. There shall not be a lot depth-to-width ratio greater than 3:1 (i.e. the depth of a lot cannot be greater than 3 times its width).

SECTION 12A-5 ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
12A-501. Design Guidelines: The purpose of these design guidelines is to encourage development that will contribute to the overall aesthetics of the Proximity Park Development District as a unique place by enhancing the built environment. These guidelines are intended to ensure that new development and redevelopment will be compatible and will enhance the overall appearance of the Proximity Park Development District. Exceptions to requirements may be allowed on a case by case basis by the Planning Commission upon submission and approval of the drawings and details of the proposed project.
12A-502. Building Materials and Construction: All buildings and other structures within Proximity Park District shall be constructed of attractive exterior sides of high quality materials including masonry, concrete, glass, and metal (when used in an incidental role).
One hundred percent (100%) of the surface of each exterior wall (excluding doors and windows) facing a public street, residential use or public open space shall consist of materials including but not limited to stone, brick, glass block, tile, cast metal, cast or cultured stone, concrete (tilt-up walls), glass, or a combination of these materials. The use of other cementitious products (e.g. stucco, Hardy Plank, or other similar materials) shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the buildings’ exterior finishes where it is deemed important as a design feature and where it will be applied under the highest standards for quality and durability. However, stucco may not be located in the first eight feet (8’) above grade on a façade visible from a public right-of-way or a public area.
Specific materials which will be excluded include exposed (i) galvanized metal facades, (ii) nondecorative cinder or concrete block, and (iii) double T concrete panels.
Exterior mechanical or electrical equipment, including, but not limited to, HVAC equipment shall be so placed or screened that the predominant design lines of the building or structure continue without visual distraction or interruption. If the function of the building or structure dictates placement of such equipment in such a manner or location that the building exterior walls themselves are unable to screen the equipment from view of adjacent existing or proposed streets or highways, they must be separately screened using materials compatible with the approved building materials with use of an appropriately designed parapet wall and the height of such screening shall be equal to the height of the equipment to be screened; or with acceptable landscaping. Accessory buildings, enclosures, appurtenant structures to, or extrusions from, any building or structure shall be of similar or compatible materials, design and construction.
When more than one (1) building is planned for PPD-O District property, the development plan shall
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS –ZONING REGULATIONS
Adopted March 21, 2018 12A-4
Article 12A
demonstrate integration and coordination of the architectural design for buildings, structures, landscaping and open space.
Buildings should be oriented so that the front or side of the building faces the public street frontage of the property. The City will consider an exception to orient a rear elevation towards a public street for unique situations due to the configuration of the lot.
12A-503. Building Material Colors: Color of materials used on the construction of all buildings, enclosures, and appurtenant structures shall be consistent throughout the entire development and will present a predominantly warm earth tone appearance. Exact color palette and materials will be approved by the City Manager.
12A-504. Architectural Design Standards:
a. Building Massing and Scale. A building’s massing is defined as its exterior volume. The height, width and depth of a structure create the overall massing of a building. A building’s scale is the relationship of its overall size and its component parts with its adjoining spaces and buildings.
b. Large Expanses. Large expanses of blank walls of any material or metal siding are not allowed. Building facades over one hundred feet (100’) long facing public right-of-way or residential property shall break up massing of buildings by dividing building facade into smaller components with a minimum of three (3) of the following elements:
1. Articulating details around doors, windows, balconies, plate lines, providing details such as “belly-bands,” recessed design elements, interesting cornice treatment details, exposed expansion joints, reveals, change in texture, or other such methods of visual relief;
2. Avoiding long, repetitive, monotonous facades – particularly those that repeat the same design element several times along the same elevation;
3. Use of darker building color and varied wall treatments;
4. Varying roof lines (see Vertical Articulation section); and
5. Change of wall plane (see Horizontal Articulation section).
c. Facade Guidelines:
1. Horizontal Articulation. Walls facing a public right-of-way or a residentially zoned property shall not extend for a distance greater than four (4) times the wall’s height without having an off-set of ten percent (10%) of the wall’s height (maximum of five (5) feet); the new plane shall extend for a distance equal to a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the maximum length of the first plane. The City may allow exceptions to this requirement upon review and approval of a typical façade elevation.

Walls facing a public right-of-way or a residentially zoned property shall not extend for a distance greater than four (4) times the height of the wall without changing height by a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the wall’s height (maximum of five (5) feet). The City may allow exceptions to this requirement upon review and approval of a typical façade elevation.
Walls not facing a public right-of-way or residentially zoned properties are exempt from the vertical articulation requirement.
12A-505. Outside Storage and Equipment in Industrial Zones: Although the outdoor storage of materials in Proximity Park is not preferred, the City recognizes it may be necessary. The temporary storage of cargo containers, operational trailers and tractors shall be allowed in the PPD-O District for up to 30 days. For long term storage, the storage shall be on hard surface or porous surface (if porous is to include rock, it must be clean rock to allow stormwater to permeate) and must be identified with site plan submitted to the City and consistent with the conditions below. If a need arises later, to accommodate businesses that are experiencing growth and/or change the process for approval must be applied for prior to establishing any storage. Considering this, the outdoor storage of materials may be permitted in accordance with the following regulations with a formal application and review. These regulations do not apply to the customary trailer parking activities associated industrial uses.
1. A request must be made to the City Manager and granted to allow outside storage.
2. Included with the request be a written explanation as to why the business needs the outdoor storage, how long they intend to have the outdoor storage and what their long term plan is to accommodate the storage.

SECTION 19-1 FINDINGS
19-101. Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the
City are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
19-102. General Causes of the Flood Losses. Flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative
effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
19-103. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the
basis of this Article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of
a series of interrelated steps.
a. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Article is
representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Article. It is in the general order of a flood which could
be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on
the Federal Insurance Administrator's most current FIS, and illustrative materials; or as
determined by a qualified engineer or hydrologist.
(19-103-a revised 09-19-18)
b. Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory
flood.
c. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood elevations at
any point.

d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.
SECTION 19-2 PURPOSE
19-201. It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 19-101; to establish or maintain the City’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this Article to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
b. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
c. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.
d. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
(19-201-d added 09-19-18)
e. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction;
(19-201-e added 09-19-18)
f. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard; and
(19-201-f added 09-19-18)
g. Preserve the integrity and stability of streams and protect water quality by restricting uses that harm natural stream functions, and by preserving the streams’ ability to function as natural filters for pollutants from urban runoff.

Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, the installation of streets and/or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, the erection of temporary forms, nor installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial-improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
State coordinating agency means the Division of Water Resources, Kansas Department of Agriculture, or other office designated by the Governor of the State or by state statute at the request of the Administrator to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in that state.
Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. "Structure" for insurance purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial-damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."

21-101. The intent of this Article is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures, lots and uses, and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures, lots and uses shall be permitted to lawfully continue notwithstanding their nonconformance to these regulations. It is in the best interest of the entire community that those nonconforming buildings, structures, lots and uses, which adversely affect the orderly development and value of other property not be permitted to continue unless restricted.

b. Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 21-12.
c. The burden shall be on the landowner or developer to establish entitlement to continuation of nonconforming situations or completion of nonconforming projects.
SECTION 21-4 NONCONFORMING LOTS
21-401.
a. This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. A substantial structure shall include any structure in excess of eight hundred (800) square feet in floor area which was constructed for a principal use permitted in the zoning district at the time of construction. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may occur only in accordance with Section 21-7.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
21-3
Article 21
b. Where a nonconforming lot does not conform to the lot area or dimensions applicable to that zoning district, the lot may be used for any permitted use in that zoning district provided all other requirements and regulations are met.
c. When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot be complied with, then the Board of Zoning Appeals may allow variances from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that:
1. Development of the property is not reasonably possible for the use proposed without such variance;
2. The variance is necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and
3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
d. For purposes of subsection c, development in compliance with the applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
e. If, on the effective date of these regulations, an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one (1) or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his or her successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within five hundred (500) feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots, but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with existing patterns of development.
f. The subdivision of any land, lot or parcel which creates a lot area or dimension which does not meet the minimum standards of these regulations is prohibited.
SECTION 21-5 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
21-501.
a. No person may increase the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in:
1. An increase in the total amount of space of building area devoted to a nonconforming use; or
2. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as building setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements, or other requirements such as parking requirements.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
21-4
Article 21
b. Subject to subsection d, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by these regulations, was designed or arranged to accommodate that non-conforming use. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21-12, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.
c. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21-12, a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming. However, a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the land may be expanded to other portions of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the natural products had already been removed on the effective date of these regulations, and where the development and performance standards otherwise applicable to such a use were complied with.
d. The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be one-time increased up to ten percent (10%) and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other provisions of this section occur.
e. Notwithstanding subsection 21-501.a., any structure used as a single-family dwelling and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not:
1. create new nonconformities,
2. increase the extent of the existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements, and
3. violate the limitations of Section 21-7.
SECTION 21-6 REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND ALTERATIONS
21-601.
a. Repairs, alterations and maintenance of structures and property where nonconforming situations exist may be made provided those repairs, alterations and maintenance conform to the regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located.
b. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy to an extent that the costs of repair or restoration would not exceed fifty percent (50%) of its structural value, then the damaged structure may be repaired or restored only in accordance with a nonconforming situation permit issued by the Zoning Administrator.
SECTION 21-7 CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USE
21-701.
a. A change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may not be made except in accordance with this section.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
21-5
Article 21
b. If the change in use is to a permitted use in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of these regulations are complied with, no permission from the City to make the change need be obtained. Once conformity with these regulations is achieved, the property may not revert to nonconforming status.
c. If the change in use is to a permitted use in the district where the property is located, however the site or development requirements cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change in use is permissible only if the Zoning Administrator issues a nonconforming situation permit. This permit may be issued if the Zoning Administrator finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by these regulations, that the intended change will not result in a violation of Section 21-8 and that all of the applicable requirements of this Article will be complied with that are reasonably possible.
d. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use if the Planning Commission finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than is the existing nonconforming use.
SECTION 21-8 NONCONFORMING SITE IMPROVEMENTS
21-801.
a. On lots with nonconforming site improvements, no additions to, or repairs or alterations of any structure or site improvement may be made without first either bringing the nonconforming site improvements into conformity with the regulations applicable to the zoning district or obtaining a nonconforming situation permit. This section shall not apply to minor repairs and renovations (less than ten percent (10%) of the structural value of a structure or site improvements), or repairs or alterations to a structure pursuant to Section 21-6.
b. When an addition to, or repairs or alterations to, any structure or site improvement is proposed on a lot with a nonconforming site improvement, the Zoning Administrator may approve a nonconforming situation permit allowing such addition or repairs or renovation upon finding that all of the following criteria are met:
1. The nonconforming site improvement(s) is the only nonconforming situation pertaining to the property.
2. Compliance with the site improvement requirements applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located is not reasonably possible.
3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
c. For the purposes of subsection b, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance with the site improvement requirements is not reasonably possible.

SECTION 21-9 ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
21-901.
a. When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 360 consecutive days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located.
b. If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a period of 360 consecutive days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located unless the Zoning Administrator issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting nonconforming situations. Such permit may be issued if the Zoning Administrator finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible.
c. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by these regulations is vacant or discontinued on the effective date of these regulations, the 360 day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of these regulations.
SECTION 21-10 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
21-1001.
a. Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of these regulations may be continued.

c. A nonconforming sign may be altered to bring the sign into complete conformity with these regulations.
d. Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be maintained.
e. If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed within thirty (30) days after such abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign.
f. If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within thirty (30) days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with this Article or be removed by the sign owner or owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign.

a. Upon removal of a nonconforming manufactured home, unless another manufactured home is moved onto the same lot within thirty (30) days from the date that the previous manufactured home was moved off the lot, such use is forfeited and shall not thereafter be reestablished.
b. Any manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be placed on a permanent, enclosed perimeter foundation within thirty (30) days from the date it is moved onto the lot.
c. No manufactured home shall be moved onto the lot if such will result in an increase in nonconformity with respect to lot size, yard or bulk requirements.

e. Upon proper application the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an exception to the time requirements of subsections a. and b. above upon a finding by the Board of hardship for the party who would reside in the manufactured home upon its relocation.
SECTION 21-12 COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS AND VESTED RIGHTS
21-1201.
a. All nonconforming projects, except as provided in paragraphs a., e., f. and g. of this section on which construction has begun, based upon the issuance of a building permit before the effective date of these regulations, and at least ten percent (10%) completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of these regulations, may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits provided a vested rights permit is obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
b. Except as provided in subsections a., e. and g., all work on any nonconforming projects shall cease on the effective date of these regulations and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a vested rights permit issued in accordance with this section by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall approve such a permit upon finding that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his or her position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the regulations as they existed before the effective date of these regulations and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete its project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be made, the Zoning Administrator shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
21-8
Article 21
1. All expenditures made to obtain a validly issued and unrevoked building, land use or sign permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the regulations that existed before the effective date of these regulations.
2. To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property.
3. To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a nonconforming project, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures.
4. An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant in dollar amount in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed project and the ordinary business practices of the developer.
c. When it appears from the developer’s plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments or other discrete units, the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection b. Subject to the guidelines in subsection b, 1:4, the Zoning Administrator shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in addition to other relevant factors:
1. Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural or engineering work.
2. Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not yet completed.
3. Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or to such a scale, in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases, that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations.
d. The Zoning Administrator shall not consider any application for a vested rights permit authorized by subsection b. that is submitted more than 180 days after the effective date of these regulations.
e. Completion of Single-Family Residential Development: Nothing in this Article shall prevent development of a single-family residential development in accordance with a final plat recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Franklin County. However, if construction is not commenced on any such land within five (5) years of the recording of the plat, the development rights shall expire.

SECTION 22-1 INTENT
22-101. These regulations are intended to require off-street parking proportional to the need created by each use in order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing, and secure off-street parking facilities. These regulations and standards also provide for loading and unloading spaces and are intended to ensure usefulness of parking and loading facilities, to protect public safety, and where appropriate, to limit potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.
SECTION 22-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
22-201. Applicability. Off-street parking facilities, as required in this Article, shall be provided for any new building and for any new use established, additions to existing use, or any change in manner of use which results in increased capacity. Additional parking need only be provided for the addition, enlargement, or change and not the entire building or use. No off-street parking facilities shall be required in the C-4 Central Business District.
22-202. Maintenance. All existing and required parking facilities shall be maintained and shall not be reduced so long as the use requiring such parking remains.
22-203. Utilization. Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same site as the use for which such facilities are required, except as authorized by Section 22-6. Such facilities shall be used exclusively for temporary parking of motor vehicles and shall not be utilized for sale or storage of merchandise, or for storage or repair of vehicles, equipment or trailers.
22-204. Residential districts. Parking facilities which make provisions for more than three (3) vehicles shall not be located within the required front yard for the district.
22-205. Computation. Where the determination of number of off-street parking spaces required results in a fractional part of a space, a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as a full space and a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded. Where requirements are established on the basis of seats or person capacity, the provisions of the City-adopted building code applicable at the time shall be used to calculate maximum design capacity.

For the purpose of this section, a compact car is a motor vehicle with an overall length which does not exceed fourteen (14) feet.
22-207. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve variations of up to ten percent (10%) from the size and number of parking spaces otherwise required under this Article when, in his or her discretion, such variation does not violate the purpose of these regulations and does not harm public health, safety or welfare. In interpreting and applying this Article the Zoning Administrator shall rely on “Parking Standards,” November 2002 edition, published by the American Planning Association.
SECTION 22-3 LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Any alley used for access to other than a single-family residence shall be paved when such is required under City-adopted regulations.
22-303. Design standards. Minimum parking facility design standards shall comply with Section 22-7.
22-304. Driveways. Driveway location and spacing shall comply with City-adopted standards. Site plans for commercial properties may include a traffic impact analysis and an internal traffic circulation plan making full use of shared entrances.

(22-305, a, b, c, d, Revised and adding e, new paragraph, a, & b, 12-21-05)
Driveways from gravel alleys to a rear garage or parking area may be covered by six (6) inches of gravel, including base, as an alternative to these surfacing requirements.
Driveways and parking areas for single-family units in residential districts may elect to pave only the vehicular wheel tracks beyond the right-of-way.
Gravel areas lawfully in existence prior to the effective date of these regulations may be maintained with six (6) inches of gravel, including base, as an alternative to these surfacing requirements.
The Zoning Administrator may, upon receiving a specific written request from an owner of a property, authorize temporary occupancy for a time period not to exceed one (1) year prior to accomplishing the required paving or a portion thereof, provided a security (such as bond, cashiers check, escrow account, letter of credit or like security) for 125% of engineering estimate or actual bids, is submitted. The security would be exercised by the City if the applicant failed to perform as agreed.
In reviewing a request for temporary occupancy prior to accomplishing required paving, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the following criteria:
a. Season of the year.
b. Affect on the adjoining property.
c. Surfacing of the connecting street.
d. Surfacing of existing adjoining parking facilities.

22-307. Drainage. All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed with storm drainage facilities so as to channel surface water away from adjoining properties and to an approved storm drainage system.
22-308. Parking facilities in residential districts.

energy conversion system within the City of Ottawa, unless a building permit has been
granted by the zoning administrator. The permit may be revoked any time the approved
system does not comply with the rules set forth in this chapter and the conditions imposed.
The owner of the wind energy conversion system must also obtain any other permits
required by other federal, state and local agencies/departments prior to erecting the system.
c. It shall be unlawful to erect or maintain a commercial wind energy conversion system within
the City of Ottawa. Commercial wind energy conversion system is a wind energy conversion
system which is intended to produce electricity for sale to a rate regulated or non-regulated
utility or for use off site.

the ground, and the tower must be designed to prevent climbing within the first twelve feet
(12').
e. Maintenance: Facilities shall be well maintained in an operational condition that poses no
potential safety hazard.
f. Restriction On Use Of Electricity Generated: A wind energy conversion system shall be used
exclusively to supply electrical power for on site consumption, except that when a parcel on
which a wind energy conversion system is installed also receives electrical power supplied
by a utility company, excess electrical power generated by the wind energy conversion
system and not presently needed for on site use may be used by the utility company in
accordance with their connection requirements.
g. Clearance of Blade Aboveground: No portion of the small wind energy system blade shall
extend within twenty feet (20') of the ground. No blades may extend over parking areas,
driveways or sidewalks.
h. Automatic Overspeed Controls: All wind energy conversion systems shall be equipped with
manual and automatic overspeed controls to limit the blade rotation speed to within the
design limits of the wind energy conversion system. All overspeed controls shall meet the
requirements as set forth by the interconnected utility.
i. Noise: For wind speeds in the range of 0-25 mph, small wind turbines shall not cause a
sound pressure level in excess of 60 dB(A), or in excess of 5 dB(A) above the background
noise, whichever is greater, as measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling. This
level, however, may be exceeded during events such as utility outages and sever wind
storms.

Article 24
j. Electromagnetic Interference: All blades shall be constructed of a nonmetallic substance. No
wind energy conversion system shall be installed in any location where its proximity with
existing fixed broadcast, retransmission, or reception antenna for radio, television, or
wireless phone or other personal communication systems would produce electromagnetic
interference with signal transmission or reception. No wind energy conversion system shall
be installed in any location along the major axis of an existing microwave communications
link where its operation is likely to produce electromagnetic interference in the link's
operation. If it is determined that the wind energy conversion system is causing
electromagnetic interference, the operator shall take the necessary corrective action to
eliminate this interference including relocation or removal of the facilities, subject to the
approval of the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator may revoke a permit
approving a wind energy conversion system if electromagnetic interference from the wind
energy conversion system becomes evident.
k. Interconnection: The wind energy conversion system, if interconnected to a utility system,
shall meet the requirements for interconnection and operation as set forth by the
interconnected utility.
l. Removal: If the wind energy conversion system remains nonfunctional or inoperative for a
continuous period of one year, the system shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall
constitute a public nuisance. The owner shall remove the abandoned system at their
expense. Removal of the system includes the entire structure including foundations and
transmission equipment. If removal of towers and appurtenant facilities is required, the
zoning administrator shall notify the owner. If the city removes a tower and appurtenant
facilities, it may sell the salvage to defray the cost of removal.
m. Right of Entrance: As a condition of operating a wind energy conversion system, the owner
irrevocably grants permission to the City to enter the property to remove the wind energy
conversion system pursuant to the terms of the conditional use permit and to inspect for
compliance with the conditions as established by the interconnected utility.

Revised 02-15-06 26-2
Article 26
regarding the proposed changes in regulations or restrictions, or proposed change in the boundary or classification of any zone or district, or the requested conditional use. c. If the application is not a general amendment, revision or change to the zoning regulations, but is for a rezoning or Conditional Use Permit affecting specific property, the property affected shall be designated by legal description and by a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. In addition to such publication notice, written notice of the proposed rezoning or conditional use shall be mailed at least twenty (20) days before the public hearing to all owners of record of the property affected and all owners of record of lands located within at least 200 feet of the area proposed to be altered. In accordance with state law such notice shall extend 1000 feet in those areas where the notification area extends outside the corporate limits of the City. All notices shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection in the office of the Zoning Administrator.

CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
Revised 02-15-06 26-3
Article 26
property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment and its reasons for recommending approval or denial.
c. Adoption of amendments. The Governing Body shall not consider an amendment which would result in a change of zoning classification for a specific property, or any application for a Conditional Use Permit, until its next regular meeting after the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period provided by state law. A proposed amendment which changes the text of the regulations but would not result in change of zoning classification of any specific property may be considered by the Governing Body without waiting for the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission and any protest petitions that have been submitted, the Governing Body shall make its consideration of the application based upon the record submitted by the Planning Commission. However, the Governing Body may, at its sole discretion, supplement that record as follows: (1) Information provided by City staff; or (2) New evidence from the applicant or any interested party, following the Governing Body’s determination that: (a) the evidence is material and significant; and (b) good cause existed for it not being presented to the Planning Commission at or before the public hearing. The Governing Body’s acceptance and consideration for such new information and/or evidence does not preclude the Governing Body from returning the recommendation of the Planning Commission to the Planning Commission for its reconsideration, whether for purposes of consideration of the new information and/or evidence, or for any other reason for reconsideration. The Governing Body may: 1) approve the recommendation of the Planning Commission without change; 2) override the Planning Commission’s recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the Governing Body; or 3) return such recommendation to the Planning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body’s failure to approve or disapprove. Upon return of a recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Governing Body may take whatever action it deems necessary. Whenever a proposed amendment is defeated by vote of the Governing Body, such amendment shall not thereafter be passed without a further public hearing and notice thereof as provided in this article. d. If such amendment or Conditional Use Permit affects the boundaries of any zone or district, the ordinance shall describe the boundaries as amended, or if provision is made for the fixing of the same upon the official maps which as been incorporated by reference, the amending ordinance shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall order the official maps be changed to reflect such amendment or conditional use, shall amend the section of the ordinance incorporating the same and shall reincorporate such maps as amended. 26-105. Protest Petition. Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves a proposed zoning amendment, revision, change, or Conditional Use Permit, if a protest petition against such amendment is filed in the office of the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of twenty (20) percent or more of the total area, excepting public streets and ways, which is located within the notification area described in Section 26-102, the ordinance adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 majority vote of all the members of the Governing Body. Immediately upon receiving the filing of such a protest petition the City Clerk shall notify the Zoning Administrator of such petition. 26-106. Limitations on Successive Applications. Provisions for a limitation on successive applications to the Planning Commission shall be as follows:
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
Revised 02-15-06 26-4
Article 26
a. No application for an amendment to these regulations including the zoning map shall be accepted by the Planning Commission if an application for the same amendment has been denied by the Planning Commission within the preceding twelve (12) months. The withdrawal of an application after it has been advertised for public hearing shall constitute a denial of the application just as if the public hearing had been held and concluded. For good cause shown by the applicant the Governing Body may waive the twelve (12) month requirements. b. Irrespective of the preceding subsection, an application for a rehearing may be accepted by the Planning Commission if in the judgment of the Planning Commission substantial justification is given. All such applications for a rehearing must be submitted to the secretary at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission following the denial of the application. If the Planning Commission at such meeting determines that there has been substantial change or justification for a rehearing, the item will be advertised and a public hearing held at the next regular scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. 26-107. Posting of Sign. An applicant for a rezoning or for a Conditional Use Permit may be required by the Zoning Administrator to place a sign upon the lot, tract or parcel of land for which the application was filed. Said sign shall be furnished by the Zoning Administrator to the applicant and the applicant shall display the sign as instructed by the Zoning Administrator. Failure to comply with this requirement shall not deprive the Planning Commission of its jurisdiction or affect any decision, but may be due cause for the Planning Commission to refuse to hear the application or to adjourn the hearing or to require further notice. 26-108. Factors to be Considered in a Rezoning. When a proposed amendment would result in a change of the zoning classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission, accompanied by a copy of the record of the hearing, shall contain statements as to the present classification, the classification under the proposed amendment, the reasons for seeking such reclassification, a summary of the facts presented, and a statement of the factors upon which the recommendation of the Planning Commission is based, using the following guidelines: a. Whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations; b. The character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its effect on the proposed change; c. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected, and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing conditions; d. The current zoning and uses of nearby properties, and the effect on existing nearby land uses upon such a change in classification; e. Whether every use that would be permitted on the property as reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the immediate vicinity; f. The suitability of the applicants property for the uses to which it has been restricted; g. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned;
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
Revised 02-15-06 26-5

Because of particular conditions associated with their activities, certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are allowed as conditional uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional requirements so as to make the use requested compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning jurisdiction. b. In approving a conditional use, the minimum requirements set out in these regulations for the underlying district must be met unless otherwise specifically reduced by the Governing Body. The requirements of the underlying district may be made more stringent if there are potentially injurious effects which may be anticipated upon other property or the neighborhood or which may be contrary to public health, safety or welfare. c. A site plan will be required, for alterations to existing buildings and any new construction, for consideration in the review process of a conditional use permit application, which includes the following minimum information: 1. The dimensions and address of the tract to be used; 2. The location of all proposed improvements including driveway access, off-street parking and other such facilities the applicant proposes to install; 3. Grade elevations (if they are to be changed); 4. Building setbacks from all property lines; 5. Front, side and rear elevation drawings of all improvements to be erected.

Whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations; 2. Whether the location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses in the surrounding neighborhood; 3. Whether the proposed use places an undue burden on the existing transportation, utility and service facilities in the area affected and, if so, whether such additional facilities can be provided; 4. Whether the proposed use is made necessary or desirable because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected; 5. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned; 6. Whether the applicants property is suitable for the proposed conditional use; 7. The recommendations of professional staff; 8. Whether the proposed conditional use would be in conformance to and further enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
9. Whether the proposed conditional use, if it complies with all the conditions upon which the approval is made contingent, will not adversely affect the property in the area affected;
10. Such other factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant from the facts and evidence presented in the application; and 11.

a. The very nature of land development creates potential for traffic congestion, overcrowding, adverse visual environmental impacts, and health problems. Also, the City strives to achieve the goal of promoting growth in Ottawa, while stabilizing the established residential patterns of the area. The City seeks to ensure that any location that accommodates intense urban use be subject to Site Plan Review by the Planning Commission in accordance with this Article. Site Plan Review helps ensure that the meaning and intent of these zoning regulations are fully complied with and so property owners and developers understand City requirements under these regulations before projects begin.
b. Site Plan Review regulates the development of structures and sites in a manner that considers the following:
1. The balancing of landowners rights to use their land, with the corresponding rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without undue disturbances, including, for example, noise, smoke, fumes, dust, odor, glare, soil erosion, and stormwater runoff;
(28-101-b-1 Revised 11-16-11)
2. The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site, and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
3. The adequacy of waste disposal methods and protection from pollution of surface or groundwater;
4. The protection of historic and natural environmental features of the site under review, and those of adjacent areas; and

SECTION 28-7 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
28-701. Other than one-, two-, and three-family dwelling units, no building shall be erected that does not meet the following minimum standards:
a. Rooftop equipment shall be screened from view from the ground near the building with vertical extensions of the building walls or with parapets or other architectural design features of the same materials used on the wall of the building. Where the topography permits, it is
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
Revisions 09-19-18 28-8
Article 28
desirable to screen such equipment from adjacent property, but it is not the intent of this requirement to increase the height of the screening significantly above that of the equipment in order to screen it from view from tall buildings or from higher ground. Raised exterior walls or screen walls should be designed to enclose groups of equipment. Wall material should be compatible with or identical to the predominant opaque material on the exterior of the building.
b. Dumpster Enclosure and Improvements:
1. Exterior refuse shall be kept in an enclosed area large enough to contain one week’s production of refuse and shall be contained in a refuse bin equipped with a lid.
2. The enclosure shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide to allow access for the truck picking up the refuse bin. The depth of the enclosure should be the depth of the refuse bin being used plus an additional four (4) feet to allow for the mechanical dumping of the refuse bin. The enclosure shall have a minimum height of five (5) feet.
3. The floor of the enclosure shall be reinforced concrete with a minimum thickness of four inches (4”) with #4 reinforcing at twenty-four inches (24") each direction.
4. There shall be a 12' x 12' concrete pad in front of the enclosure. This pad should be a minimum depth of eight inches (8") and have #4 reinforcing rods every twenty-four inches (24") in each direction and have a test strength of 4,000 psi.
5. The enclosure should be shielded on three sides by a wall or decorative fence and positioned in such a manner to shield the refuse bins from sight of any public thoroughfare or adjoining property to extent possible. When decorative fence is used the corner post should be made of steel pipe with a four inch (4”) diameter and filled with concrete.
6. The number and location of the refuse bins shall be located on the site plans prior to approval.
c. The form and proportion of building shall be consistent or compatible with the scale, form and proportion of existing development in the immediate area.
d. The use of unusual shapes, color and other characteristics that cause new buildings to call excessive attention to themselves and create disharmony is discouraged.
e. The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as windows and glass doors, of a front facade should relate favorably to the rhythms established in adjacent buildings.
f. Overly long horizontal facades (walls) should be articulated with variations in the building plane and parapet height, materials and colors, entrance canopies, landscaping and other design or site plan features. Parking lots along the facade can also relieve horizontally through the use of landscaped fingers and island containing trees and shrubs.
g. Architectural design should create visual interest through the use of different textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes. The use of walls in a single color, with little detailing or completely bland, is discouraged.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – ZONING REGULATIONS
Revisions 09-19-18 28-9
Article 28
h. Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest.
i. Careful consideration of durable materials, proportions, and shapes, emphasizing the importance of roofs as integral and embracing elements of the over-all design, is encouraged.
j. Use of substantial amounts of masonry materials (face brick, stucco, stone) is encouraged. The use of aluminum siding, metal ribbed panels, and extensive mirrored glass surfaces is discouraged. Evaluation of building materials shall be based on the quality of its design and relationship and compatibility to building materials in the immediate neighborhood. Corrugated metal facades should be complemented with abundant use of masonry, whether brick, stone, stucco or split-face block, especially along perimeter streets. Architectural metal panels may be an acceptable substitute for masonry. Appropriate landscaping can be used to complement and enhance a building’s design, color and material.
k. Architectural treatments (e.g., building material, colors, facade design, roof lines, screening) shall be consistent and compatible on all sides. Treatment that is uniform on all sides will be deemed to meet the requirements of this principle. Adjacent land uses, visibility from public streets, use of screening devices (walls, fences, berms, landscaping) are criteria to be considered when varying this treatment. The applicant will have the burden of demonstrating the reasons for differing treatments on different sides (e.g., the need for truck access on one side and pedestrian access on another).
Long expanses of overhead doors should be relieved by matching their color to the wall or trim, recessing the doors, or adding architectural details to diminish the dominance of the doors.
28-702. Mini-warehouse facilities shall be developed in accordance with the following minimum standards:
a. Off street parking shall be provided as follows:
1. Parking shall be provided by parking/driving lanes adjacent to the buildings. These lanes shall be at least twenty feet (20’) wide for one-way access lanes and at least twenty-five feet (25’) wide for two-way access lanes.
2. One parking space for every one hundred fifty (150) storage cubicles shall be located adjacent to the leasing office. A minimum of three (3) such spaces shall be required.
3. Required parking spaces may not be rented as or used for vehicle storage, unless identified on the site plan or development plan.
b. There shall be landscaped screening and fencing around the perimeter of the project. The fending shall be a minimum of six feet (6’) in height. When a development borders an arterial street, adjoining residential or commercial development, the fence shall be constructed of decorative material approved by the Zoning Administrator along those sides. Chain link fencing (with or without barbed wire fencing on top) may be used on sides that adjoin other industrial property of similar or greater intensity, as approved by the Zoning Administrator.

SECTION 1-1 TITLE
1-101. These regulations shall hereinafter be known and may be cited as the Subdivision Regulations for the City of Ottawa, Kansas and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these regulations."
SECTION 1-2 PURPOSE
1-201.
a. Subdivision Regulations are the process through which undeveloped land is converted into buildable lots for residential, commercial and industrial uses. The physical arrangement of these lots along with provisions for streets, alleys, utilities, schools, parks and other community facilities will in a large part determine the quality of life in the community and, therefore, is of public interest. These regulations establish standards that insure that growth will reflect sound planning and will not be detrimental to the community.
b. These regulations are designed, intended and adopted for the following purposes:
1. To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the City of Ottawa.
2. To implement the Comprehensive Plan, area plans and corridor management plans for the City of Ottawa.
(1-201-b-2 02-19-14)
3. To provide for adequate light, air and privacy, to secure safety from fire, flood and other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land.
4. To protect and conserve the value and desirability of land and neighborhoods throughout the community.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Revised 02-19-14 1-2
Article 1
5. To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, playgrounds, recreation and other public requirements and facilities necessary to protect and promote public health, safety and general welfare.
6. To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and re-subdivisions.
7. To insure proper legal descriptions, monumenting of land, and adequate and accurate platting and records of land subdivision.
8. To harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land to the existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts.
9. To insure that public facilities are available and will have a sufficient capacity to serve the proposed development.
10. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public improvements including the reservation or dedication of land for park and recreational purposes.
11. To reserve or dedicate land for open space to preserve natural areas for watercourses, drainage ways, woodland, rugged topography, wildlife habitat, and for water quality and quantity, and to protect land from soil erosion.
12. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations, and other City regulations which affect the development of the land.
SECTION 1-3 AUTHORITY
1-301. These Subdivision Regulations and minimum standards for land development are adopted by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Governing Body under powers conferred by K.S.A. 12-749 and Article 12, Section 5 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas.
SECTION 1-4 POLICY
1-401.
a. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other menace nor unnecessarily subjecting existing development to such danger or peril. It is further intended that land shall not be subdivided until proper provision has been made for drainage, water and sewage and other necessary infrastructure.
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Revised 02-19-14 1-3
Article 1

1-601.
a. The regulations contained herein shall apply to the subdivision of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, tracts or other divisions of land for the purpose of sale or of building development, whether immediate or future, including the resubdivision or replatting of land or lots.
b. The owner(s) of any land subject to these regulations subdividing that land shall prepare a subdivision plat in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. No building or zoning permit shall hereafter be issued for construction on any land that has not been subdivided in compliance with these regulations and all other applicable state laws and local laws in effect at the time of the subdivision of that land.
SECTION 1-7 EXEMPTIONS
1-701. The following transactions shall be exempt from these regulations.
a. Boundary adjustments between one or more contiguous lots, tracts, or parcels of land, which will not create any additional lots, tracts or parcels, shall not be subject to the subdivision platting, or replatting requirements of these regulations.

c. A conveyance made to correct a bearing or distance description in a previously recorded conveyance.
d. Any transfer by operation of law.

effective date of these regulations. For purposes of these regulations, “legally subdivided, resubdivided, platted or replatted” shall include any certificate of survey submitted and recorded, as provided by these requirements, prior to the effective date of these regulations.
f. The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land that existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and was not previously exempted under any previous subdivision regulations, where no more than one (1) additional lot, tract or parcel is created, provided, however, that the creation of that additional lot, tract or parcel shall comply with the provisions for lot splits set forth in Article 11 of these regulations. Any further division of the lot, tract or parcel, including any remainder parcel or tract, shall be platted in conformance with the requirements of these regulations.
g. Division of land for agricultural purposes, or single-family residential purposes, in parcels or tracts of land of ten (10) acres or more, when not involving right-of-way for streets or easements and not involving the construction of other than agriculture buildings, shall be exempt from the requirements of these regulations, provided, however that an appropriate setback and easements be provided to protect long-term development of roadways.
h. The division of a platted lot zoned and used for industrial purposes only, as required by state law, provided each resulting lot has frontage on a public street.
SECTION 1-8 INTERPRETATIONS-CONFLICT
1-801.
a. Where a requirement of these regulations imposes restrictions that differ from those requirements imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other statute, regulation, or other provision of law; the provision which imposes the higher or more restrictive standard shall apply.
b. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or other private agreement.
c. A subdivision of land which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations shall not become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of these regulations.
d. The provision of these regulations are additional limitations upon all other laws heretofore passed or which may be passed hereafter governing any subject matter set forth in the provisions of these regulations.

Revised 02-19-14 1-5
Article 1
a period of five (5) years from the date upon which the plat for such property was first recorded with the Franklin County Register of Deeds. Provided, the division of land was legally done in conformance with the Ottawa Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time of such recording.
b. Properties divided or platted for any use other than residential purposes shall not be permitted to develop or further develop except in conformance with these regulations and the Ottawa Zoning Regulations. Persons who obtain a validly issued permit under the previous Ottawa Zoning Regulations shall be permitted to develop the property so long as the permit issued under the previous Ottawa Zoning Regulations does not expire. Failure to begin substantial construction under said permit before the expiration of the permit shall not protect the owner from the provisions of these regulations or the Ottawa Zoning Regulations then in effect.
SECTION 1-10 APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF SUBDIVISION PLATS; DEDICATIONS WITHIN URBAN GROWTH AREA
(1-10 revised 07-19-06)
1-1001. All subdivision plats or re-plats of land laid out in building lots, and the streets, alleys or other portions of the same intended to be dedicated for public use, or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting thereon, shall be submitted to the Ottawa Planning Commission for its consideration and approval.

(1-1002 added 07-19-06)
SECTION 1-11 ACCRUED RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES SAVED
1-1101. These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, corporation, or as waiving any right of the City under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation by lawful action of the City except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
SECTION 1-12 SEVERABILITY

The hearing may be adjourned from time to time and at the conclusion of the same, the Planning Commission shall prepare its recommendations and by an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Planning Commission, adopt the same in the form of proposed subdivision regulations and shall submit the same, together with the written summary of the hearing, to the Governing Body. 2-802. Action by the City Governing Body. The Governing Body may either: (1) approve such recommendations by ordinance; (2) override the Planning Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote; or (3) return the Planning Commission's recommendations, specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Planning Commission's recommendations, the Planning Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendations giving the reasons therefore, or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by the respective ordinance, or take no further action. If the Planning Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the Governing Body following the Planning Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Planning Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly.

The objective of this Article is to provide for the division of a tract of land or lot into not more than two buildable lots which meet the minimum size and area requirements for the zoning district in which said lots are located without having to comply with the platting requirements described in Article 6 of these Regulations. The new lots cannot, thereafter, be further subdivided without replatting. The Zoning Administrator may approve or disapprove lot splits in accordance with the requirements of this Article. 11-102. No building permit shall be issued for any structure to be located on a lot produced by a lot split until the lot split has been approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the requirements of this Article. SECTION 11-2 APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS; APPLICATION PROCEDURE 11-201. Request for lot split approval shall be made by the owner of the land to the Zoning Administrator. Four (4) copies of a scale drawing of the lots involved if there are no structures thereon or, if structures are located on any part of the lot being split, four (4) copies of a survey of the lot and the location of the structure(s) thereon together with the precise nature, location and dimensions of the proposed lot split, shall accompany the application. The application shall provide a legal description for the original lot and legal descriptions for each of the lots produced by the proposed lot split, and such legal description is required to be certified by a registered land surveyor. The application shall be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons to receive notices. The Zoning Administrator may require such list to be prepared by a registered abstractor. Written notices shall be mailed to all owners of land within two hundred (200) feet of the property proposed to be split. Such owners shall have ten (10) business days from the date of notification to notify the Zoning Administrator of any protests they may have concerning the lot split. The ten (10) day waiting period may be waived upon submission in writing of statements from those to be notified that they have no objection to the proposed lot split.

SECTION 13-4 DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
13-401. Developers desiring to develop property as a Conservation Subdivision in accordance with and subject to the development standards, conditions, procedures and regulations of this Article are provided the following Conservation Subdivision development options. These options are provided as an incentive for developers to preserve and protect natural resources on their property as permanent open space, particularly streams and floodplains; and to provide increasing incentives for those developers that protect a greater percentage of their property.
a. Tier One: Stream and Floodplain Conservation. Tier One Conservation Subdivision provides for residential development at the base density permitted in the underlying residential zoning district plus a net 5% density incentive. In order to obtain the Tier One density incentive permitted herein, the development must utilize a conservation design which sets aside and preserves all streams, stream corridors, and floodplains.
b. Tier Two: Natural Areas Conservation. Tier Two Conservation Subdivision provides for residential development at the base density permitted in the underlying residential zoning district plus a 10% net density incentive. In order to obtain the Tier Two density incentive permitted herein, the development must utilize a conservation design which sets aside and preserves all streams, floodplains and vegetated stream corridors, and all additional constrained and sensitive lands, natural hazards and resources.
c. Tier Three: Enhanced Conservation. Tier Three Conservation Subdivision provides for residential development at the base density permitted in the underlying residential zoning district plus a 15% net density incentive. In order to obtain the Tier Three density incentive permitted herein, the development must utilize a conservation design which sets aside and preserves all streams, floodplains and vegetated stream corridors; all additional constrained and sensitive lands and natural hazards and resources; and additional, usable open space. The total open space provided must equal at least 35% of the development to qualify.

a. Density. The permitted density for development within a Conservation Subdivision shall be determined in accordance with the following chart, hereinafter referred to as the Development Incentive Chart. The percentage increases noted as the multiplier in the Chart are percentage increases from the base density identified in the approved Subdivision Yield Plan for the proposed development.

b. Minimum Required Conservation Land. All Conservation Subdivisions shall preserve at a minimum streams, stream corridors and floodplains. Additional incentives are provided with greater percentages of conservation land within the Conservation Subdivision as set forth in the Development Incentive Chart in Subsection a. The percentage of conservation land for any given Conservation Subdivision shall be calculated based upon the total acreage of property within the proposed subdivision, less areas containing streams and stream corridors, floodplains, other constrained and sensitive lands, and additional usable open space. Required conservation land may include any constrained or sensitive lands as defined herein, including land preserved for stream setbacks. Except as otherwise provided herein, conservation land shall not be included within any residential lot.
c. Lot Area. The lot area and minimum lot size for lots within a Conservation Subdivision shall be determined in accordance with the Development Incentive Chart set forth in Subsection a. For Option Three Conservation Subdivisions, the minimum lot size shall be calculated by reducing the minimum lot size for the relevant zoning district by the proportion of land set aside for conservation, plus the appropriate incentive multiplier; except that in no case shall the minimum lot size be less than that allowed in an HO Housing Opportunity Overlay District, (see Article 12-404 of Zoning Regulations) including additional density incentives

Revisions 09-19-18 13-7
Article 13
allowed within that district. For Option One and Two Conservation Subdivisions the typical lot area is likely to be much closer in size to the established threshold for each zone because that lot size can be delivered by developers while still meeting the minimum conservation land requirements.
d. Lot Width at Building Line. The minimum lot dimensions for main buildings within a Conservation Subdivision shall be calculated by reducing the minimum lot dimensions for the base zoning district by the proportion of land set aside for conservation, plus the appropriate incentive multiplier; except that in no case shall the minimum lot width be less than that allowed in an HO Housing Opportunity Overlay District (see Article 12-404 of Zoning Regulations).
e. Yard Regulations. The builder or developer of a Conservation Subdivision is encouraged to consider variations in the principal building position and orientation, but shall observe the following minimum standards for buildings within a Conservation Subdivision. Minimum yard dimensions shall be calculated by reducing the yard dimensions for the base zoning district by the proportion of land set aside for conservation, plus the appropriate incentive multiplier; except that in no case shall the minimum yard dimensions be less than that allowed in an HO Housing Opportunity Overlay District (see Article 12-402 of Zoning Regulations). Exceptions to these minimum setback regulations may be approved by the City, in its sole discretion, during plat approval process when deemed appropriate and desirable under the circumstances.

SECTION 13-14 CONSERVATION LAND DESIGN STANDARDS
13-1401. Designated conservation land within a Conservation Subdivision shall meet the following standards:
a. Significant Areas and Features. Conservation land should include the most unique and sensitive resources and locally significant features of the property within the Subdivision such as meadows, grasslands, woodlands, streams, stream corridors, berms, watercourses, farmlands, wildlife habitats, historic buildings and/or sites, archeological sites, cultural features, green space, scenic views, etc.
b. Contiguous Land. Conservation lands within a development shall be contiguous to provide for large and integrated open space areas within the Subdivision. Non-contiguous parcels of conservation lands may be approved by the City during plat approval process upon a finding that such exception is necessary and/or desirable based upon consideration of the size of the project, the size of the conservation parcels, the types of features and resources included within the conservation lands, and other relevant considerations. Long thin strips of conservation land (less than one hundred (100) feet wide) are prohibited, unless approved by the City during plat approval process upon a finding that such configuration of the conservation land is necessary and/or desirable to connect other significant areas, to protect linear resources such a streams or trails, or to provide a buffer.
c. Open Space Network Connection. Whenever feasible, conservation land within a Conservation Subdivision shall be designed and laid out as part of a larger continuous and integrated open space system to ensure that an interconnected network of open space will be provided throughout the City.
d. Visibility. Conservation land shall be located and designed within the Conservation Subdivision to add to the visual amenities of neighborhoods and to the surrounding area by maximizing the visibility of internal open space. Such enhanced visibility of conservation land may be accomplished through design and location of such open space as terminals at the ends of streets or along single-loaded street segments, particularly along the outside edges of street curves, and by maximizing the visibility of external open space as perimeter greenbelt conservation land.
e. Resource Uses. A substantial amount of the minimum required conservation land may be devoted to active resource uses such as agriculture, horticulture, or equestrian uses; provided, at least twenty percent (20%) of the minimum required conservation land remains available for the common use and enjoyment of the subdivision residents or the public.
f. Recreational Uses. A substantial amount of the minimum required conservation land may be comprised of active recreation facilities such as playing fields, golf courses, tennis courts, etc., exclusive of parking lots; provided, at least twenty percent (20%) of the minimum required conservation land remains available for common use and enjoyment of the subdivision residents or the public.
g. Buffering. Conservation land shall be designed to provide buffers and to protect scenic views as seen from existing roadways and from public parks. Where the proposed development abuts a public park, open space, wildlife sanctuary or preserve, a natural greenway buffer at least fifty (50) feet wide shall be provided within the development along its common boundary with said land, within which no new structures shall be constructed, nor

SECTION 15-1 FINDINGS
Ottawa’s network of streams and rivers form the backbone of its drainage system and provide many
other critical benefits for the city’s environmental health and quality of life. The importance of this
natural “green infrastructure” system has become even more evident through multiple rounds of
stormwater master planning and implementation of stormwater management projects; preparation of
the city’s Comprehensive Plan; and as the city works collaboratively with community stakeholders to
protect and improve water quality through its Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)
program in accordance with the Clean Water Act. Critical benefits provided by streams and
particularly the vegetated riparian (stream) corridors through which they run, include but are not
limited to the following.
15-101. Water quality. Natural streams, creeks, and rivers provide important water quality benefits
as they collect and convey stormwater runoff from the city’s landscape. Riparian corridor vegetation
slows runoff that flows over stream banks, reducing runoff velocities and volumes by infiltrating
water into the ground, preventing erosion, and filtering pollutants from the remaining runoff that
enters the stream. Vegetated streambanks also resist erosion from stream flow by slowing flow
velocities and reinforcing bank stability, reducing the amount of sediment entering the stream from
bank erosion and failures. Natural vegetation and stream bed materials create turbulence that
aerates stream flows, increasing dissolved oxygen, supporting healthy aquatic life, and preventing
nuisance conditions from stagnant water and anaerobic bacteria. Riparian vegetation provides
shade that reduces water temperature for aquatic life and improves dissolved oxygen capacity.
15-102. Flood Protection. Floodplains and riparian corridors protect life, property and
infrastructure by more safely conveying flood waters. Streambank and riparian vegetation slows
flow velocities, reducing flash flood potential in downstream areas. Adequate, unobstructed and
vegetated floodplains provide capacity for higher flows when streams overflow their banks; and
infiltrate a portion of the flows into the ground. Adequate, undeveloped stream buffers also separate
occupied and unoccupied structures and infrastructure from flood hazards.
15-103. Stream Degradation. Extensive stream assessments and research conducted in Eastern
Kansas and nationally clearly demonstrate that adequate, healthy vegetated riparian corridors and
floodplains reduce and prevent stream degradation and improve overall stream health and quality.
By reducing runoff velocities and volumes, and reinforcing streambanks, healthy stream corridors
prevent incision (down cutting) of stream beds and lateral bank erosion and advancement.
15-104. Wildlife Habitat. Streams and riparian corridors provide critical habitat and resources for
wildlife, as well as a connected network that allows safe and unimpeded movement. This network is
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Added 09-19-18 15-2
Article 15
most valuable when it is complete and unfragmented, allowing migration through the larger riparian
system and connected upland habitat areas.
15-104. Open Space and Recreation. Streams and riparian corridors provide undeveloped open
space and natural areas throughout the community, improving neighborhood aesthetics, allowing the
enjoyment of nature, and providing greenways for recreational amenities like bicycle and pedestrian
trails. These benefits increase property values in nearby neighborhoods and districts and create
healthier environments.
15-105. Comprehensive Plan. For these reasons the Ottawa Comprehensive Plan (Chapter 4,
Rev. 11-16-11) calls for a holistic, watershed approach to stormwater management that preserves
and enhances water quality, while protecting and restoring natural systems. A key recommendation
is to develop and adopt a stream buffer ordinance, noting that:
Headwater streams are often severely degraded by urbanization and intense agricultural
practices. As a consequence, many communities have adopted stream buffer requirements
as part of an overall urban watershed protection strategy—a practice the City of Ottawa
should follow for the watershed of the Marais des Cygnes River and its tributaries and
creeks. Urban stream buffers are an integral element of any local stream protection
program. By adopting some of these rather simple performance criteria, communities can
make their stream buffers more than just a line on a map. Better design and planning also
ensure that communities realize the full environmental and social benefits of stream buffers.
SECTION 15-2 PURPOSE
15-201. Based on the findings described in Section 20-101 through 105, this Chapter is intended for
the following purposes.
a. Improving Water Quality.
b. Protecting Life and Property.
c. Protecting Infrastructure.
d. Providing Open Space Amenities.
e. Providing Greenway Trail Opportunities.
f. Protecting Environmental Quality.
g. Providing Certainty and Flexibility.
h. Increasing public knowledge and understanding of protecting water resources.
SECTION 15-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
15-301. Scope and Applicability.
a. Upon adoption the stream buffer regulations of this chapter will apply to all applications for
approval of preliminary plans, development plans, any other plans provided for in the zoning
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Added 09-19-18 15-3
Article 15
ordinance, preliminary plats, final plats and amendments to such plans or plats except as
follows:
1. If the City Planning Commission has not recommended approval of a final plat for a
unified development plan, preliminary plan, development plan or preliminary plat that
was approved before October 3, 2018, the regulations of this chapter will not apply to
any phases of the pre-adoption approved plan as long as the City Commission
recommends approval of the first final plat within one year of the date that the Director
of Community Development sends certified mail notice of this requirement to the
subject property owner.
2. If the City Commission has recommended approval of a final plat for a pre-adoption
approved plan before October 3, 2018, the regulations of this chapter will not apply to
any phases of the pre-adoption approved plan as long as the City Planning
Commission recommends approval of the next final plat for the pre-adoption
approved plan by October 3, 2018.
3. If the requirements of (1) through (2) have been met, the regulations of this chapter
will not apply to any phases of the unified development plan, preliminary plan,
development plan or preliminary plat as long as the City Planning Commission
recommends approval of each subsequent final plat within 3 years of the date that
City Planning Commission recommended approval of the immediately preceding final
plat.
4. The regulations of this chapter will not apply to amended development plans or
amended preliminary plats if no significant changes are made. A significant change is
any change that: (1) adds additional land area to the approved plan; (2) changes the
overall land use in a way that would increase stormwater runoff volumes and rates;
(3) increases the number of lots by 10% or more (as compared to the number of lots
included in the originally approved plan/plat); or (4) increases the developed area by
10% or more (as compared to the originally approved plan/plat).
5. The regulations of this chapter will not apply to amended development plans or
amended preliminary plats if the proposed changes to the development plan or
preliminary plat are not located in an area on the development plan or preliminary plat
where the buffer requirements would normally apply. If the proposed changes are
located in an area where the stream buffer requirements would normally apply, then
the amendment of that area on the plan/plat must comply with the regulations of this
chapter for the amended area only.
b. The Director of Community Development is authorized to approve an extension of the time
frames established above for a maximum of one year. Extension requests must be
submitted in writing and include an explanation and justification for the request.
c. For the purposes of this section, unified development means a development consisting of
one or more zoning or subdivision applications that were approved by City Commission on or
about the same date on contiguous property through the same applicant. Additionally, for
purposes of this section, commercial and residential plans approved collectively as one
unified development (although approved through separate ordinances and plans) will be
construed to be a single approved preliminary plan or phase.

Article 15
d. The stream buffer regulations of this chapter will apply to all public infrastructure projects for
which preliminary or final plans have not yet been approved by the City Commission.
15-302. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies.
a. The stream buffer standards of this chapter apply to all streams identified on the Natural
Resources Map.
b. The City Stormwater Coordinator/GIS Technician is authorized to maintain and periodically
update the Natural Resources Map to ensure its accuracy. Map updates that add stream
reaches or otherwise have the affect of expanding the land area affected by the stream
buffer regulations of this chapter must be noticed in the same manner as zoning map
amendments.
15-303. Lands to Which Ordinance Does Not Apply.
a. The stream buffer regulations of this chapter are not intended to prohibit maintenance of
existing City-owned facilities within the stream buffer.
b. Streams and rivers already protected by municipal levees at the time of adoption, such as
the Marais des Cygnes River.
c. Storm sewer systems, human-made channels (except those designed to function as natural
streams), and roadside ditches are not considered streams (except where natural streams
are aligned with a roadway).
15-304. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Article to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
Article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Article shall prevail. All other City laws
inconsistent with this Article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
15-305. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Article shall be
held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body, and
shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes.
SECTION 15-4 ADMINISTRATION
a. Administration. The Director of Community Development shall be responsible for
administration of this Chapter.
b. Review for Compliance. Review for compliance with these standards will be conducted in
conjunction with platting or preliminary or final plan review, as described in Section 20-403.
15-401. Buffer Plan.
a. A stream buffer plan must be provided when the stream buffer standards apply. The plan
must delineate the buffer zones and the proposed development site in relation to:

Article 15
c. Prohibited Activities and Uses. Anything not specifically allowed above is prohibited. Furthermore, streams may not be enclosed or otherwise altered from a natural state except as provided for by Section 20-6, and in accordance with all other applicable state and federal laws and regulations. d. Flexibility. The provisions of this Chapter are intended to coincide with other provisions of the Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Regulations, to create a streamlined system that provides multiple community benefits while maximizing developer flexibility. Specific provisions include the following. 1. Dedication and Reservation of Public Sites and Open Space (Subdivision Regulations Article 5). Floodplains and sensitive lands must be protected under Article 5, and count toward the total open space requirement. Privately owned open space, such as permanent open space created by a stream buffer that is accessible for recreation, also counts toward the total open space requirement. 2. Conservation Development Standards (Subdivision Regulation, Article 13). Article 13, Section 13-401 designates a stream buffer as Tier One Conservation Developments, and Section 13-1101 provides for a 5% net density bonus in Tier One Conservation Developments. Protecting additional natural and sensitive areas may increase the net density bonus to as great as 15%. 3. Non-residential Developments. Non-residential development sites that include stream buffer areas are allowed up to a 25-percent reduction in minimum required parking and up to a 25-percent increase in allowable building height over the base zoning requirements. In addition, parking areas may be sited in the Outer and Middle Zones provided that they are constructed with a pervious pavement surface, subject to approval by the City Engineer; and provided that the surface pavement is maintained such that sediments are removed, and infiltration capacity is continuously maintained. 15-502. Specific Standards. a. Vegetation. Disturbed stream buffer areas shall be revegetated with native vegetation appropriate for Eastern Kansas floodplains and riparian corridors. b. Ownership and Responsibility for Stream Buffer. 1. Stream buffer must be formally designated as permanent open space in common ownership and maintenance, such as by a Homeowners Association (HOA) or commercial property owner/manager; placed in a conservation easement or deeded to a land trust, park department, or other land management agency; or deeded to the City only if the City agrees to take ownership. Owners (including easement holders and land management agencies) must allow municipal bicycle/pedestrian trail connections through the permanent open space. 2. Where an HOA or commercial owner maintains the permanent open space, legal and financial provisions must be provided for perpetual maintenance of the permanent open space in the event that the original owner is dissolved or transfers ownership to another entity.

Article 15
3. Alternatively, the City may agree to take ownership in all cases in lieu of a
conservation easement or deed to a land management agency. See also Subdivision
Regulation Article 5 – Dedication and Preservation of Public Sites and Open Space.
4. Maintenance, the owner is responsible for all maintenance, including inspection and
enforcement of the buffer provisions and use restrictions, maintenance of vegetation
and removal of invasive species, and other reasonable maintenance as appropriate.
Maintenance activities must comply with all other state and federal regulations and
should minimize the use of chemical pesticides. The owner must submit a buffer
maintenance plan that defines the required maintenance activities and schedule; and
which clearly identifies the party or entity responsible for maintenance. Should the
responsible entity cease to exist (such as a homeowner’s association or corporation),
the maintenance plan must state that responsibility for its implementation would fall to
the current owners.
c. Boundary Markers.
1. Boundary markers must be put in place clearly marking required stream buffer before,
during and after construction.
2. Boundary markers must be installed at the intersection of private lot lines with the
outer edge of the permanent open space before receiving final City approval of plans
for clearing, grading, or sediment and erosion control.
3. Construction fencing must be placed at the outer edge of the permanent open space
in the outer zone to delineate the buffer. This fencing must be maintained throughout
the construction process.
4. Permanent signs must be placed at the edge of the permanent open space after
construction to denote the buffer as follows:
a. For single-lot developments, signs must be posted every 100 feet along the
boundary of the permanent open space.
b. For multiple lots located along a buffer, signs must be located at the
intersection of every other lot line along the boundary of the permanent open
space, or at 100-foot intervals, whichever is less.
5. The sign face shall be two square feet in area.
6. Required signs must read: “Protected Stream Buffer - No clearing, grading,
construction or disturbance of vegetation permitted. Routine maintenance and trash
removal are allowed. Ordinance 4004-18 with the sign message located
approximately 4 feet above the ground. No other message shall be on the sign.
7. Signs must be maintained and remain legible at all times.
d. Inspections. Required stream buffer must be accessible to the directors of Community
Development Department and Public Works and their designees to facilitate inspection,
construction, maintenance and other activities related to the stream and public infrastructure
in the buffer area.

SECTION 15-6 STREAM BUFFER VARIANCE PROCEDURES
15-601. Flexibility.
a. The stream buffer regulations of this chapter have the effect of limiting development near
streams identified on the Natural Resources Map.
b. To help offset potential adverse impacts on development yields for property near stream
corridors, property owners are encouraged to use the open space development and
conservation subdivision development options of Article 13 of the subdivision regulations.
15-602. Stream Buffer Variance Criteria. Variances to any of the standards of this chapter may
be approved by the City Commission, after review and recommendation of the City Planning
Commission, subject to all applicable city, state and federal regulations, and subject to the
provisions of this section. When exceptions are approved, applicants must mitigate impacts in
accordance with the mitigation standards in 20-4-c-6, below. Notice will be provided of the hearings
held by the City Planning Commission and the City Commission on the exception request in
accordance with adopted code.
a. The City Commission may approve a variance if it finds that a property that is subject to this
chapter is of such size or shape or is subject to or is affected by such topographical
conditions, or is to be devoted to such uses that full compliance with this chapter is
impossible or impractical and that the exception is necessary so that substantial justice may
be done and the public interest secured. In order to approve an exception request, the City
Commission must also determine that adequate measures will be put in place to protect the
integrity of the stream buffer that includes appropriate mitigation of disturbed natural
resources.
b. Variances must be identified on the preliminary plat or preliminary plan.
c. To recommend or approve a variance, the City Planning Commission and City Commission
must determine that all of the following conditions exist:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property;
2. That the exception is necessary for reasonable and acceptable development of the
property in question and is not a greater exception than is required to allow
reasonable and acceptable development of the subject property; and
3. That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property in the vicinity in which the subject property is situated.
d. Applicants for a variance must submit a stream buffer exception application and mitigation
plan, including any planned mitigation measures, to the Community Development
Department. The exception application and/or mitigation plan must include the following:
1. A written description of the requested variance and the special circumstances or
conditions affecting the property that warrant an exception under (1) through (3)
above;
CITY OF OTTAWA, KANSAS – SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Added 09-19-18 15-10
Article 15
2. A description of all measures taken to avoid or otherwise minimize encroachment into
the buffer zone;
3. Proposed mitigation for any encroachment; and
4. A preliminary buffer plan, as required by 20-401 that clearly displays the location and
total acreage of proposed clearing and grading, and the percentage of outer zone
area proposed to be cleared. The buffer plan must also include the limits and total
acreage of proposed mitigation, and ratio of proposed mitigation to cleared area.
e. The department must review the plan for compliance with the stream buffer regulations of
this chapter and recommend that the exception request be approved, approved with
conditions, or denied. An exception may be recommended for approval when the
Community Development Department director determines that an exception is warranted,
under the provisions of this section, and when the integrity of the stream corridor will be
protected through avoidance, minimization and appropriate mitigation measures.
f. Utilities may encroach into the streamside zone only when available system connection
points physically preclude an alignment farther from the edge of stream, or, in the case of
sanitary and storm sewers, when the controlling elevations provide insufficient head for
normal system function. Streambanks and natural resource areas affected by allowed
encroachments must be stabilized in accordance with the City’s standards, specifications
and design criteria.
15-603. Conditions for Approving Stream Buffer Variances. Disturbed natural resources must
also be mitigated. Mitigation may be provided on the property or in another location, provided that it
complies with the following criteria. Revegetation or restoration of any portion of the original
disturbance counts toward the required mitigation.
a. Mitigation of outer zone vegetation that is contiguous to the remaining outer zone vegetation
must be provided at a ratio of 1 unit of mitigation area to 1 unit of existing outer zone area.
b. Mitigation of outer zone vegetation that is not contiguous to the remaining outer zone
vegetation but is along the same stream must be provided at a ratio of 1.5 to 1.
c. Mitigation of outer zone vegetation that is not located along the same stream must be
provided at a ratio of 2.0 to 1.
d. Encroachment into the middle or streamside zones or alteration of the stream channel must
be mitigated at a ratio of 3 to 1.
e. The Community Development Department Director may approve mitigation at City
designated locations in lieu of locations owned or controlled by the applicant.
15-604. Further Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court as provided in K.S.A. 12-759 and 12-760.
