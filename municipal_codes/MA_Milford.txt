Town of Milford
P R E F A C E
The General By-Laws of the Town of Milford were adopted at the Annual Town Meeting on March 7, 1924. Since that time, those By-Laws have been amended on several occasions. In addition, some newer provisions, by covering the whole subject to which they relate, have by implication served to repeal earlier provisions. Moreover, by accepting certain state statutes, the provisions of which are inconsistent with certain provisions of these By-Laws, the Town has rendered the effect of those provisions null and void. This is also true in instances where subsequent enactments of the state Legislature either provide a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of the subject matter also covered by these By-Laws, or are otherwise inconsistent with them.
The following compilation of the General By-Laws of the Town of Milford contains editorial notes which reflect the dates of subsequent amendments, and those provisions which have been repealed by implication or otherwise. In certain instances, editorial corrections and additions have been supplied so that the By-Laws can be more readily understood. Such wording is set forth in parentheses ( ).
Finally, the 1959 Compilation of these By-Laws contain certain inaccuracies, not in the text, but in the numbering of the Articles of the By-Laws. As such, certain amendments, by referring to the 1959 compilation, would appear to refer to provisions which had not, in fact, been adopted. This compilation places those amendments in the proper relationship to the By-Laws as originally adopted in 1924, and an explanatory note has been provided where such placement has occurred.
This compilation does not include the Town’s Zoning By-Laws, its Building Code, its personnel Wage and Salary Administration Plan, or those by-law provisions dealing with the inspection of wires, plumbing and gas, except fee schedules.

and ATM 1976, Art. 71; Amended Annual Town Meeting (ATM)
May 21, 2012 Article 22; Approved by AG August 28, 2012.
ARTICLE 2
FINANCE COMMITTEE
Section 1 (Composition: Term of Office) - There shall be a Finance Committee consisting of fifteen citizens of the Town who shall be sworn to a faithful performance of their duties. No Town Employee or Official, either elective or appointed, shall be eligible to membership on the Finance Committee. For the purposes of this By-Law a person will not be considered a Town Official solely by virtue of being a Town Meeting member.
The Board of Selectmen shall appoint, not later than the first day of May, 1922, the said fifteen citizens, five for the term of one year, five for the term of two years and five for the term of three years, and annually not later than the first day of May, the said Selectmen shall appoint five members for the term of three years in place of those whose term shall expire in that year.
They shall immediately give public notice of such appointment in one of the local newspapers, if there be such.
If any person so appointed does not within fifteen days thereafter take the oath aforesaid, his office shall thereupon become vacant and such vacancy shall forthwith be filled by the Selectmen.
Section 2 (Officers) - The Committee shall meet, choose its own officers, and adopt such rules and regulations affecting its government as may from time to time be necessary.
Section 3 (Filling of Vacancies) - The Board of Selectmen shall fill any vacancy that may occur in the membership of the Finance Committee caused by death, resignation, removal from town or other causes.

and management of any department of the Town; and the books,

shall be open to its inspection.

NOTE: Amended, ATM 1975, Article 24. Although the 1975
Amendment purported to add a new Section 1 to
Article “9” of the By-Laws, that Amendment actually
served to add that Section 1 to this Article 2. The
Article number referred to in the Town Meeting Vote
had been improperly assigned to this Article 2 in
the 1959 compilation. Amended, STM March 13,
1989, Article 15. Amended, ATM May 13, 2011, Article 14, approved by AG September 9, 2011. Amended, ATM May 23, 2016, Article 16, approved by AG August 23, 2016.

NOTE: Article 3A, above, would appear to cover the entire
subject of appointment and duties of the Town’s legal staff.
Accordingly, this Article 5 would appear to have been
superseded by said Article 3A. See Sullivan vs. City of
Worcester, 346 Mass. 570 (1963).
ARTICLE 6
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION
Section 1 (Composition, Term of Office) - There shall be an Industrial Development Commission, consisting of eleven (11) members, appointed by the Board of Selectmen for three year overlapping terms, so arranged that the terms of four members shall expire on the first Monday following the annual Town election during the following year.

Such appointments shall take effect immediately;
however, the initial terms of office shall be deemed
effective as of the first meeting of the Board of Selectmen
held after the 1979 annual Town election.” This By-Law
was adopted in 1978, by deleting the former Article 6,
which dealt with the Town Physician, and inserting in

Section 4. Criminal History Check Authorization.
The Police Department may conduct State and Federal fingerprint based criminal history check for individuals applying for certain licenses including those engaged in the business of Hawking and Peddling or other Door-to-Door Salespeople, Pawn Dealers, and Hackney Drivers.
An applicant, seeking to engage in the above employment shall submit, if required by the licensing authority, fingerprints to be taken by the Police Department.
Upon receipt of the fingerprints the Police Department will transmit the fingerprints to the State Police Identification Unit through the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS), formerly the Criminal History System Board (CHSB).
In rendering a fitness determination, the Police Department will decide whether the record subject has been convicted of, or is under pending indictment for, a crime, which bears upon his/her ability or fitness to serve in that capacity, any felony or a misdemeanor, which involved force or threat of force, controlled substances, or was a sex-related offense.
A record subject may request and receive a copy of his/her criminal history record from the Police Department. Should the record subject seek to amend or correct his/her record, he/she must contact CHSB for a state record or the FBI for records from other jurisdictions maintained in its file.
The Town or any of its officers, departments, boards, committees or other licensing authorities is hereby authorized to deny any application for, or to revoke or suspend any license or permit, including renewals and transfers thereof, for any person who is determined unfit for the license, as determined by the licensing authority, due to information obtained pursuant to this by-law, or take any other action in relation thereto.
NOTE: On March 28, 1955 the Town voted to accept G.L. Ch. 41,
sec. 97A under Article 82 of the warrant for the Annual
Town Meeting. That Chapter, by providing a comprehensive
scheme for the establishment of the Town’s police department
and by setting forth the powers and duties of the chief-of-police,
effectively repeals this Article 7. On March 6, 1925, under
Articles 13 and 14 of the warrant for the Annual Town
Meeting, the Town voted to place its police officers and
the chief-of-police under Civil Service. On March 6, 1931,
the Town voted to accept the provisions of G.L. Ch. 147,
sec. 13A relative to the establishment of a reserve public
33
force. On March 25, 1957, under Article 88 of the warrant

Section 3 - The Board shall meet, choose its own officers, and adopt such rules and regulations affecting its government as may from time to time be necessary.

NOTE: On June 24, 1937, the ATM voted to establish a
Planning Board under G.L. Ch. 41, sec. 81A, inserted
by St. 1936, Ch. 211. The composition, term of
office and duties of the Town’s Planning Board are
generally mandated by G.L. Ch. 41, sec. 81A ff.
Thus, this Article 8 with the exception of Section 4,
has been superdated.
ARTICLE 9

At the time of a permit application or request for determination or application for a Certificate of Compliance, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified in the regulations of the Commission. The fee shall be deposited in a revolving fund in accordance with G.L.c.44, Section 53E ½ . If authorized pursuant to Ch. 44, Section 53E ½, such fee shall be deposited in a separate account, for use only for wetlands protection activities. The Conservation Commission shall use such filing fees to implement this Article, the regulations promulgated hereunder, and any policies developed by the Conservation Commission, including but not limited to the employment of a Conservation Agent, the responsibilities of such Conservation Agent to include, but not be limited to, review of resource areas, performing site visits, briefing the Conservation Commission, serving as liaison between the Conservation Commission, applicants, abutters, consultants and other interested parties, drafting determinations of applicability and orders of conditions, verifying implementation of erosion control measures, facilitating public hearings, issuing certificates of compliance and enforcing the provisions of this Article, the regulations promulgated hereunder, and the policies developed by the Conservation Commission. This fee is in addition to that required by the Wetlands Protection Act (General Laws Chapter 131, Section 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00), however, the Conservation Commission may credit this fee towards the fee required with the filing pursuant to the Wetlands Protection Act and its Regulations. The Conservation Commission may waive the filing fee for an application, request for determination or application for a Certificate of Compliance filed by a government agency.
In order to enforce the provisions of Article XXX, the regulations promulgated hereunder, and the policies developed by the Conservation Commission to the extent consistent with Ch. 44, Section 53G of the G.L. and any other law pertaining thereto, or at any point during the review of an application until a Certificate of Compliance is issued, the Conservation Commission may find that the assistance of outside consultants is warranted due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed project or because the project may have a significant effect upon the values the Conservation Commission is authorized to protect. Upon reaching such a finding, the Conservation Commission may require an applicant to pay the reasonable costs and expenses for consultant services deemed necessary by the Conservation Commission. This fee is called the Consultant Fee. The
73
consultant services may include, but shall not be limited to, ascertaining the extent of the Conservation Commission’s jurisdiction, analyzing resource area functions and values, evaluating wildlife habitat, analyzing hydrogeologic and drainage conditions, providing assistance during appeal or litigation, researching environmental or land use law, and inspecting work to insure compliance with Article XXX.

MILFORD POND AND LOUISA LAKE BOATING REGULATIONS
SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
1.1 Milford Pond, formerly known and named as Cedar Swamp Pond, was placed under the jurisdiction of the Milford Conservation Commission by vote of Town Meeting on April 24, 1979 (see Article 40 of the 1979 Adjourned Annual Town Meeting Warrant).
1.2 Town Meeting subsequently voted to rename Cedar Swamp Pond to Milford Pond on April 30, 1979 (see Article 48 of the 1979 Adjourned Annual Town Meeting Warrant).
1.3 The Board of Selectmen established the Milford Pond Restoration Committee on January 10, 1994 to oversee the long range planning effort to restore the pond.
1.4 The Town of Milford and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jointly conducted the Milford Pond Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Project in accordance with Plans dated July 25, 2014.
1.5 Said Restoration Project will increase the depth of approximately seventeen acres of Milford Pond by up to twelve feet to restore deep water aquatic habitat.
1.6 Said Restoration Project will also provide increased opportunities for boating and fishing in Milford Pond.
1.7 The Massachusetts Natural Heritage Endangered Species Program, during Project planning and permitting, identified the potential for migration of invasive species into Milford Pond by result of inappropriately cleaned recreational boats.
1.8 The Massachusetts Natural Heritage Endangered Species Program, during Project planning and permitting, identified the potential for protection of endangered species nesting in Milford Pond by control of noise and disturbances from recreational boating.
1.9 It is therefore the intent of the provisions contained herein to protect the restored Milford Pond aquatic ecosystem by strictly regulating the type of boats allowed and the maintenance of any boats launched into Milford Pond or Louisa Lake, which is upstream of Milford Pond.
93

SECTION 5: CONTROL OF INVASIVE PLANTS AND SPECIES
5.1 No person shall launch a vessel into the waters of Milford Pond or Louisa Lake, or at any time after such launch transfer a vessel or trailer from any public, private or commercial launch area on Milford Pond or Louisa Lake without first inspecting said vessel and trailer for visible marine growth, including macrophytes (weeds).
5.2 Any such visible marine growth shall be removed and disposed of in a manner so as to ensure that it is not released into Milford Pond, Louisa Lake, or any water body. In order to prevent the migration of invasive plants and species boat owners shall:
5.2.1 remove any visible mud, plants, fish or animals from structure before transporting equipment;
5.2.2 eliminate water from boat and equipment (bait buckets, pails, etc.) before transporting;
5.2.3 clean and dry anything that contacted water (boats, trailers, equipment, clothing, dogs, etc.); and
5.2.4 plants, fish or animals shall not be released into Milford Pond, Louisa Lake, or any water body unless taken from such body of water.
5.3 If any transportation or migration of an invasive species is suspected, the enforcement authorities identified in Section 6 hereinafter shall be notified immediately.
94

ZONING BY-LAW 
Town of Milford, Massachusetts 
 
 
As Amended Through October 15, 2018 
 
PREFACE 
 
 The Town of Milford initially enacted zoning regulations in the mid-1940's when the Town Meeting, on September 11, 1945, voted "to accept the recommendations of the Zoning Board appointed by the Selectmen under Article 22 of the Annual Town Meeting of 1945...for the purpose of original establishing the boundaries of the districts and the regulations and restrictions to be enforced therein, and adopt such....by-laws with respect thereto as may be contained in said recommendations."  Those by-laws subsequently became effective after they were approved by the Attorney General on May 3, 1946. 
 Those original zoning by-laws were amended by the Town Meeting from time to time after their initial adoption until the Special Town Meeting of November 15, 1965. At that time, the Town voted to adopt a new comprehensive Zoning By-Law to replace the zoning by-laws and all amendments thereto which were then in effect.  That new Zoning By-Law was approved by the Attorney General on December 20, 1965.  Since that time, the Town Meeting has amended the Zoning By-Law as indicated in the APPENDIX included at the end of this document. 
 The following pages contain the provisions of the Zoning By-Law as amended through October 15, 2018 Town Meeting.  It is anticipated that this booklet will be updated as necessary to reflect the amendments to the Zoning By-Law that have become effective on and after the date of this booklet.  A current version of the Zoning By-Law can be viewed by logging on the Town of Milford web page at www.milfordma.gov . 
 Although every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the content of this booklet, the Town of Milford expressly disclaims any liability for errors.  If any such errors are noted, they should be brought to the attention of the Town of Milford, Legal Department, Town Hall, Milford, MA 01757, (508) 634-2302.   
 Moreover, if there are any questions concerning any of the provisions set forth in this booklet, the official records of the town meetings at which those provisions were adopted should be consulted.  Those records are on file in the office of the Town Clerk, Town Hall, Milford, MA 01757. 
 It is hoped that this booklet will prove useful to the citizens of the Town of Milford and to those who own or use real estate within the Town.  It is suggested that the reader consult their attorney, however, before attempting to act upon its content.

ARTICLE   I  ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURE 
 
1.1 Title and Authorization. 
 
This By-Law shall be known and may be cited as the Zoning By-Law of the Town of Milford, Massachusetts and is referred to hereinafter as "This By-Law.”  This By-Law is adopted in accordance with and pursuant to the authority granted to the Town by Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution, and any and all amendments thereto. 
 
1.2 Purpose and Intent. 
 
This By-Law is designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, flood and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent overcrowding of land and undue concentration of population; to encourage housing for persons of all income levels; to facilitate the adequate provision of water supply, drainage, sewerage, schools, open space and other public requirements; to conserve the value of land and buildings, including the conservation of natural resources and the prevention of blight and pollution of the environment; to promote the development of the natural, scenic and aesthetic qualities of the community; to promote an efficient land use pattern which fosters a diversified tax base without imposing an undue burden on the Town's financial and service capabilities; and to promote the growth and physical development of the Town in accordance with plans, policies and programs adopted by the Planning Board, with due consideration given to the recommendations of the appropriate state and regional planning agencies. 
 
1.3 Administrative Official. 
 
This By-Law shall be administered and enforced by the Building Commissioner, with the assistance of such other persons as the Board of Selectmen or Town Meeting may direct.  Duties of the Commissioner under this By-Law shall include receiving applications, issuing building permits, interpreting district boundaries, approving plans, inspecting premises, issuing certificates of zoning compliance, taking action on violations, and any other lawful actions necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with this By-Law. 
 
1.4 Building Permit. 
 
1.4.1  Requirement of Permit:  No building or structure shall be erected, enlarged, moved, altered, removed or demolished without a permit issued by the Building Commissioner.  No such permit shall be issued until such construction, alteration or use, as proposed, shall comply in all respects with the provisions of this By-Law, or with a decision rendered or special permit granted by the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority. 
 
1.4.2  Permit Procedure:  The Building Commissioner shall require that all applications for building permits and accompanying plot plans and specifications required by the State Building Code contain the following: 
 
1.4.2(a)  A grading plan, prepared by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer, showing proposed finished grading at two-foot minimum contour intervals; the location of wetlands, the areas bordering such wetlands, and land within a flood hazard district on the site, if any; and drainage provisions and their effects on adjoining parcels.  Such grading plan shall comply with the individual lot drainage requirements of Section 3.16 herein. 
 
1.4.2(b)  Such other information as the Building Commissioner may require to ensure compliance with this By-Law, such as off-street parking areas, screening, fencing, open space and earth removal. 
 
1.4.3  Waivers:  The Building Commissioner may waive any requirement for a grading plan for the alteration or enlargement of an existing building or structure, or for the construction of an accessory building or structure.  Said requirement may also be waived for the construction or erection of a non-accessory building or structure if such a waiver is first approved by the Planning Board, the Board of Health and the Conservation Commission. 
 
1.4.4  Commencement of Work;  Compliance:  No work, involving the construction, enlargement, alteration, removal, demolition or moving of a building or structure, shall begin until all required plans accompanying the application for the building permit for such work have been approved by the Building Commissioner.  Such work shall be carried out in compliance with such plans. 
 
1.4.5  Time Limitations:  If the work authorized by any building permit has not commenced within six months after its issuance, or if such work is suspended for a period of one year after its commencement, said permit shall be canceled by the Building Commissioner, and written notice of such cancellation shall be given to the holder of said permit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing time limitations, the Building Commissioner may allow, for good cause, not more than two extensions of said permit; however, such extensions shall not exceed 90 days each. 
 
1.4.6  Foundation Location Plan- Upon the completion of the foundation of a new or substantially altered structure, a foundation location plan shall be submitted in triplicate to the Building Commissioner.  Said plan shall be signed by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer and shall indicate that the foundation is located in substantial accordance with the approved plans specified in Section 1.4.2, above.  An updated or modified plot plan may serve as a foundation location plan.  No further work shall proceed until such plan has been approved by the Building Commissioner, except for the modification of such foundation to comply with the approved plot plan.  No such foundation location plan shall be required relative to the construction or alteration of any structure for which a waiver has been granted in accordance with Section 1.4.3, above. 
 
1.4.7  Final Plan - Upon the completion of a new or substantially altered structure, for which a grading plan, as specified  in Section 1.4.2, above, was required, a final plan, signed by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer shall be submitted in triplicate to the Building Commissioner.  Such final plan shall show the location, ground coverage outline, gross floor area and external dimensions of any building or structure shown on the plans submitted pursuant to Section 1.4.2, above, and approved by the Building Commissioner as specified in Section 1.4.4, above.  Such final plan shall also show the drainage systems, off-street parking areas, signs, fences, screening areas and other accessory facilities, either shown on said approved plans, or otherwise required or regulated by this By-Law.  Such final plan shall contain a certification that the buildings, structures and other facilities shown thereon are in compliance with the said approved plans, with this By-Law and with any applicable decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority.  An updated or modified plot plan or foundation location plan may serve as the final plan.  Such final plan shall be accompanied by a written notification that the work shown on said approved plans has been substantially completed. No such final plan shall be required relative to the construction or alteration of any building or structure for which a waiver has been granted in accordance with Section 1.4.3, above.  
1.5  Certificate of Zoning Compliance. 
 
1.5.1  Requirement for Certificate - No premises and no building or structure, erected, constructed, enlarged or altered,  or in any way changed as to use, under a permit or otherwise, shall  be occupied or used unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for  such occupancy or use is issued by the Building Commissioner.  Such certificate shall not be issued until the premises, building or structure, and the proposed use and accessory uses comply in all respects with this By-Law, and with any applicable decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority including site plans approved by the Planning Board under Section 1.15 of this bylaw. 
 
1.5.2  Certificate Procedure - An application for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be filed with the Building Commissioner and shall be accompanied with the Certificate of Occupancy required by the State Building Code.  No such application, which involves the occupancy or use of premises with respect to which a final plan is required by Section 1.4.7, above, shall be favorably acted upon by the Building Commissioner until the notification of substantial completion and said final plan have been duly submitted in accordance with said Section 1.4.7, and the Commissioner has approved said final plan.  No such application which involves the occupancy or use of premises with respect to which a site plan is required by Section 1.15 of this bylaw shall be favorably acted upon by the Building Commissioner until the improvements shown on said site plan have been completed, confirmation of which shall be shown on an as-built plan.  Such as-built plan shall enumerate all deviations, if any, from said site plan.  Within seven days of the date on which such application is filed with the Building Commissioner, the Commissioner shall either allow or deny such application in writing and shall set forth the reasons for his action thereon.  A Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be conditional on the maintenance of full compliance with the provisions of this By-Law in effect at the time of issuance, and with any applicable decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority, and such certificate shall be revoked if such compliance should fail. 
 
1.5.3  Temporary Certificate - Pending the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance, as specified in Section 1.5.1, above, a temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance may be issued for a period not exceeding six months during the alteration of a presently occupied building or for partial occupancy or use of a building pending its completion.  No such temporary certificate shall be issued if the building and its accessory uses fail to conform to the provisions of this By-Law to such a degree as to create a discernible inconvenience or hazard to the public or to those who propose to occupy said building.  Notwithstanding the foregoing time limitation, the Building Commissioner may allow, for good cause, not more than two extensions of such temporary certificate; however, such extensions shall not exceed 90 days each.  Where a site plan is required by Section 1.15 of this bylaw, such temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance may only be issued provided the applicant produces appropriate surety in the form of a Bond or other appropriate form of performance guarantee for an amount and duration approved by the Planning Board. 
 
1.5.4  Completion of Plantings - All trees, landscaped open space and buffers, planting screens and other landscaping required by this By-Law or by any applicable decision of a designated special permit granting authority, shall be installed prior to occupancy or commencement of use.  No Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued until all required plantings have been completed.  Such Certificate shall be revoked if the owner fails to maintain such plantings or landscaping.  However, where such compliance is impracticable due to the season of the year, the Building Commissioner may issue a temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance as specified in Section 1.5.1 herein if appropriate surety has been provided as specified in Section 1.5.3 herein. 
1.6   Violations. 
 
1.6.1  General Requirement - If the Building Commissioner shall be informed or have reason to believe that this By-Law, any permit or plan required herein, or any decision of the Board of Appeals or other special permit granting authority has been, is being or may be violated, the Commissioner shall initiate an investigation of the facts and inspect the property where the violation is suspected. Written requests for the enforcement of this By-Law shall be acted upon by the Building Commissioner within fourteen days in accordance with Section 7 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws, and if the Commissioner shall refuse to act on any such request, an appeal may be taken in accordance with Section 8 of said Chapter 40A and Section 1.8 of this By-Law.  If any such violation is found by the Building Commissioner, the violator shall be duly notified of the nature of the violation and shall be subject to any and all actions specified below that may be deemed appropriate by the Commissioner to correct that violation. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any procedures provided by said Chapter 40A for the enforcement of zoning by-laws. 
 
1.6.2  Withholding of Permit - The Building Commissioner shall withhold a permit for the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, removal, demolition or moving of a building or structure of the building or structure, as erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, removed, demolished or moved, would be in violation of this By-Law, or any applicable decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority.  The Building Commissioner shall also withhold any Certificate of Zoning Compliance or other permit for the new use of any building, structure or land if such new use would be in violation of this By-Law or any decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority. No officer, board, committee or commission of the Town of Milford shall grant any permit or license for a new use of a building, structure or land if such use would be in violation of this By-Law or any such decision. 
 
1.6.3  Stop Order - A stop order may be issued by the Building Commissioner with respect to any violation of this By-Law or decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority.  Such order shall be issued to the owner of the property on which the violation is occurring, or to his agent. Such order shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the violation, and the conditions under which the work or use may continue.  A time limit, not to exceed seven days, shall be permitted to allow for the necessary correction of the violation, or for the initiation of appropriate action necessary to correct the violation.  Any person who shall perform work, or use or occupy property in violation of a stop order shall be in violation of this By-Law and shall be subject to the enforcement provisions provided herein.  The failure of the Building Commissioner to issue a stop order for any reason whatsoever shall not be construed as an estoppel against the Town of Milford, and shall not serve to prevent the town from pursuing any other legal remedy provided by Chapter 40A of the General Laws for the enforcement of zoning by-laws. 
 
1.6.4  Revocation of Permit - The Building Commissioner may revoke any permit or certificate issued under the provisions of this By-Law if there were any false statements or misrepresentations of fact in the application or plans on which such permit or certificate was based. 
 
1.6.5  Prosecution of Violation; Penalty - If the notice of any violation or stop order is not complied with by the expiration of the time specified therein for the correction of the violation, the Building Commissioner shall institute legal action with respect to the violative action, use or condition.  Any person who violates any provision of this By-Law or of any decision of the Board of Appeals or other designated special permit granting authority shall be subject to a fine of not more than $200.00.  Each day that any such violation continues to exist after written notice thereof by the Building Commissioner shall constitute a separate offense. 
1.7   Board of Appeals. 
 
1.7.1  Composition; Term of Office - There shall be a Board of Appeals, consisting of five members and three associate members, appointed by the Board of Selectmen. The five members of the Board of Appeals shall be appointed to five year overlapping terms so arranged that the term of one member shall expire each year on the first Monday following the Annual Town Election.  The three associate members of the Board of Appeals shall be appointed to three year terms, which shall expire on the first Monday following the Annual Town Election.  The terms of the said associate members shall be arranged so that the term of only one associate member shall expire in any single year. 
 
1.7.2  Vacancies; Removal from Office - Any vacancy in the office of member of the Board of Appeals and any vacancy in the office of associate member of the Board of Appeals, occurring by reason of death, resignation, removal, as herein provided, or otherwise, shall be filled by the Board of Selectmen for  
19the balance of the unexpired term.  Any member or associate member of the Board of Appeals may be removed from office by the Board of Selectmen upon written charges and after a public hearing. 
 
1.7.3  Compensation - Subject to appropriation, the members and associate members of the Board of Appeals shall receive such compensation as may from time to time be provided in the Personnel Wage and Salary Administration Plan. 
 
1.7.4  Powers and Duties - The Board of Appeals shall have the following powers: 
 
1.7.4(a)  To hear and decide appeals in accordance with Section 1.8 of this By-Law. 
 
1.7.4(b)  To hear and decide applications for special permits upon which the board is empowered to act under this By-Law. 
 
1.7.4(c)  To hear and decide petitions for variances. 
 
In exercising the powers granted by subsection (a) of this Section 1.7.4, the Board of Appeals may make orders or decisions, reverse or affirm in whole or in part, or modify any order or decision, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer or board from whom or which the appeal is taken, and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit or certificate. 
 
1.7.5  Officers; Rules - The Board of Appeals shall elect annually a chairman from its own number and a clerk, and may, subject to appropriation, employ experts and clerical and other assistants. The board shall adopt rules, not inconsistent with this By-Law or with Chapter 40A of the General Laws, for the conduct of its business, and regulating appeals, and applications and petitions for variances and special permits submitted for action to the board.  Such rules may prescribe the form, size, content and number of copies of any such application, petition or appeal, and accompanying plans, and may establish a filing fee to defray the cost of processing same.  Such rules shall be filed with the Town Clerk.  Failure of the board to so file such rules with the Town Clerk, as aforesaid, shall render such rules null and void. 
 
1.8 Appeals to the Board of Appeals. 
 
1.8.1  Persons Entitled to Bring Appeals - Any person, including an officer or board of the Town of Milford, or an officer or board of any adjoining town, that is aggrieved by an order or decision of the Building Commissioner or of any other administrative officer or board rendered under the provisions of this By-Law or of Chapter 40A of the General Laws, or the Metropolitan Area Planning Council may appeal that order or decision to the Board of Appeals. For the purpose of this section, the inability of a person to obtain a permit, certificate or enforcement action from the Building Commissioner or any other administrative officer or 
board under the provisions of this By-Law or of said Chapter 40A shall constitute an order or decision which can be appealed to the Board of Appeals in accordance with this section. 
 
1.8.2  Application Procedures - An appeal to the Board of Appeals shall be taken within 30 days of the date of the order or decision being appealed.  Such appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a notice of appeal, in quadruplicate, with the Town Clerk. Such notice of appeal shall be as specified by the rules of the Board of Appeals and shall specify the grounds for the appeal. 
 
1.8.3  Transmittal Requirements - Upon the receipt of any such notice of appeal, the Town Clerk shall forthwith transmit copies of that notice to the Building Commissioner, or to such other officer or board whose decision forms the subject matter of the appeal, and to the Board of Appeals and to the Planning Board.  An additional copy of that notice shall be kept on file in the office of the Town Clerk.  The Commissioner, or other officer or board, as the case may be, shall forthwith upon receipt of such copy submit to the Board of Appeals and to the Planning Board copies of all documents and papers relating to such order or decision. 
 
1.8.4  Review by the Planning Board - The Planning Board may, within 30 days of the date on which such notice of appeal was filed with the Town Clerk, submit a report to the Board of Appeals containing recommendations and the reasons therefore, which report should be designed to assist the Board of Appeals in reaching a determination of the appeal.  The Board of Appeals shall not hold a hearing or render a decision on any such appeal until said report has been received from the Planning Board and reviewed by the Board of Appeals, or the 30 day time limit specified in this section has expired.  The report of the Planning Board shall be advisory in nature and shall not prevent the Board of Appeals from reaching a decision contrary to the recommendations set forth in said report. 
 
1.8.5  Public Hearings - The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on any such appeal within 65 days of the date on which the notice of appeal, specified in Section 1.8.2, above, was filed with the Town Clerk.  Notice of that hearing shall be published, mailed and posted as required by Sections 11 and 15 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws. 
 
1.8.6  Decisions - The Board of Appeals shall make its decision on any such appeal within 75 days of the date on which the notice of appeal, specified in Section 1.8.2, above, was filed with the Town Clerk.  The concurring vote of four members of the Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse an order or decision of the Building Commissioner or of any other administrative officer or board. Within 14 days of the date on which the Board of Appeals shall make its decision, but in any event no later than 75 days after the date on which such notice of appeal was so filed with the Town Clerk, the Board of Appeals shall place its decision in written form, and shall file that written decision, together with the detailed record of its proceedings, specified in Section 15 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws, with the Town Clerk and in the office of the Planning Board.  Upon such filing, the Board of Appeals shall forthwith mail notices of its decision in the manner prescribed by said Section 15.  Failure of the Board of Appeals to so file its written decision and detailed report with the Town Clerk within the 75 day period shall result in the revocation of the order or decision which formed the subject matter of the appeal, and the Town Clerk shall, at the expiration of that 75 day period, file a notice to that effect in the office of the Town Clerk and shall cause copies of that notice to be mailed in the manner prescribed by said Section 15.  That notice shall specify that the order or decision which formed the subject matter of the appeal was revoked because of the failure of the Board of Appeals to file its written decision and report thereon within 75 days of the date on which the notice of appeal was filed with the Town Clerk.  That notice shall also specify that appeals from that constructive revocation, if any, shall be made pursuant to Section 17 of said Chapter 40A, and that any such appeal must be filed within 20 days after the date on which such notice was filed in the office of the Town Clerk. 
 
1.9    Variances 
 
1.9.1  Authorization - The Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant a variance from the terms of this By-Law, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws, in instances where the board specifically finds that each of the following conditions is met: 
 
1.9.1(a)  With respect to the particular land or structures for which the variance is sought, there are circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape or topography of the land or structures and especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which such land or structures are located. 
 
1.9.1(b)  A literal enforcement of the provisions of this By-Law from which the variance is sought would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the applicant for the variance, and that hardship caused by the circumstances referred to in (a), above. 
 
1.9.1(c)  The grant of the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public good. 
 
1.9.1(d)  The grant of the variance will neither nullify nor substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of this By-Law. 
 
1.9.2  Application Procedures - An application for a variance shall be filed, in triplicate, with the Town Clerk.  Such application shall be as specified by the rules of the Board of Appeals. 
 
1.9.3  Transmittal Requirements - Upon receipt of any such application, the Town Clerk shall forthwith transmit copies of that application to the Board of Appeals and to the Planning Board. An additional copy of that application shall be kept on file in the office of the Town Clerk. 
 
1.9.4  Review by the Planning Board - The Planning Board may, within 30 days of the date on which such application was filed with the Town Clerk, submit a report to the Board of Appeals containing recommendations and the reasons therefore, which report should be designed to assist the Board of Appeals in reaching a determination on the application.  Such report should specify whether, in the judgment of the Planning Board, any of the provisions of this By-Law should be varied in response to such application, and if so, to what extent and whether any conditions should be imposed on the applicant.

   l   Subject to Site Plan Review in accordance with Section 1.15, above. 
   2 Provided that the Board of Appeals specifically finds that there is adequate drainage of water and chemicals, and that no drainage will adversely affect the environment. 
   3 See Section 3.7 
   4 Clubs and lodges, the chief activity of which is customarily carried on as a business, are prohibited in any residential zoning district. 
  5 On Special Permit, issued by the Board of Appeals, a trailer may be temporarily occupied by persons engaged in the erection or construction of their own dwelling on the same premises for a period not to exceed one year.  A trailer may be temporarily occupied by persons who are engaged in the repair of their own dwelling after such dwelling was damaged by fire, storm or other causes, if the trailer so occupied is located on the same premises as the damaged dwelling.  Such occupancy shall  not exceed six months; however, that period may be extended for not more than an additional six months by the Building Commissioner for good cause shown. 
  6 Off-street parking customarily incidental to a residential use only. 
  7 Increase to 4 non-commercial vehicles for a detached single-family house. 
  8 Only if such use is accessory to activities which are permitted as a matter of right, and only if the Board of Appeals specifically finds that such use does not substantially derogate from the public good. 
  9 Any Special Permit issued shall lapse in the event that title to the principal building in which the supplemental apartment is created is transferred from the owner of said principal building at the time of issuance to any other person not his spouse.  Any such Special Permit shall lapse within three years of the date on which it is granted, subject to renewal. 
  10 Trailers may be authorized accessory to temporary recreational uses otherwise authorized by the Board of Selectmen and temporarily in connection with on-going construction projects.  Upon Special Permit issued by the Board of Appeals, a trailer may be utilized as an accessory structure (and use) to a primary hospital use. 
  11 All structures and activity areas appurtenant to the primary use shall be located at least 100 feet from abutting  residentially zoned or utilized land. 
  12 See Section 3.12 for standards of development for congregate retirement living facilities.

ARTICLE III  GENERAL REGULATIONS 
 
3.1  Non-Conforming Uses and Structures - The lawful use of any structure or land existing at the time of the enactment or subsequent amendment of this By-Law may be continued although such structure or use does not conform with the provisions of this By-Law, subject to the following conditions and exceptions:) 
 
3.1.1  Non-Use - Non-conforming uses which have not been in operation for two consecutive years shall not be re-established, and any future use shall conform with the provisions of this By-Law provided, however, that non-conforming uses which have not been in operation for a period of two consecutive years, but which use has not been abandoned, may be re-established in accordance with Section 3.1, above, upon the issuance of a Special Permit by the Board of Appeals.  A non-conforming use shall be considered abandoned when the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent. 
 
3.1.2  Restoration - No non-conforming structure damaged by fire, storm or other catastrophe to the extent of more than 75% of its re placement value as determined by the Building Commissioner shall be repaired or rebuilt except upon issuance of a Special Permit by the Board of Appeals authorizing such repair or rebuilding. 
 
3.1.3  Extensions - Any non-conforming structure or use may be extended, altered or structurally changed upon the issuance of a Special Permit by the Board of Appeals.  No such Special Permit shall be issued unless the Board of Appeals shall specifically find that such extension, alteration or change shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing non-conforming structure.  Single-family or two-family non-conforming residential structures and accessory buildings, other than trailers, may be extended, altered, structurally changed or restored without limitation, and without a Special Permit, provided that such action doesn’t increase the non-conforming nature of said structure and does not involve the construction or erection of any building within any front, side or rear yard required for such structure at the time of its original construction and, if none were so required, within any front, side or rear yard required by this By-Law as follows:  Lots of 10,000 square feet or less, the yard requirements specified for the RA District; lots of between 10,001 square feet and 20,000 square feet, the yard requirements of the RB District; lots greater than 20,000 square feet; the yard requirements for the RC District.  In the event that such a single-family or two-family residential structure is located within such specified minimum front, side or rear yard area, it may nonetheless be extended within such specified area if the extension is consistent with the existing building line, upon the issuance of a Special Permit by the Board of Appeals. 
 
3.1.4  Non-conforming Uses - The non-conforming use of land or a building may be replaced by another non-conforming use upon the issuance of a Special Permit by the Board of Appeals.  No such 
 Special Permit shall be issued by the Board of Appeals unless the Board of Appeals shall specifically find that the replacement use shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing use.  Once the non-conforming use of land or a structure is brought into conformity with this By-Law, such land or structure shall not revert to any non-conforming use. 
 
3.1.5  Conforming Uses in Non-Conforming Structures or Sites - The change of use of a site or structure, which site or structure does not conform to the Intensity of Use requirements of Section 2.5 herein, is permitted without Special Permit provided that the proposed use is permitted in the subject zoning district.

3.2.3  Swimming Pools - Notwithstanding the above, a swimming pool (private) may be allowed within the required rear and side yards provided that no swimming pool may be allowed closer to the property line than one-half (50%) of the required set-back. 
 
 Any exterior lighting for pool use shall not exceed 45 degrees in vertical distance from the pool deck, and shall not illuminate any lot other than that in which the pool is considered a structure. 
 
3.2.4  Setback Reduction - Notwithstanding the above, the required side and rear yard setbacks may be reduced by not more than 50% for an accessory building or structure not exceeding 120 square feet in gross floor area and 10 feet in height. 
 
3.2.5  No trailer or other vehicle may be utilized for commercial purposes (other than active transportation) or as a base for conduct of retail sales from any fixed location(s) within any district.  This prohibition shall not be deemed to affect those vehicles which customarily and on a seasonal basis move throughout the Town, stopping randomly to make sales and moving on again. 
 
3.2.5.1  Notwithstanding the foregoing, portable warehouses may be utilized in commercial and industrial districts upon the issuance of a Special Permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Section 1.10 and so long as such portable warehouse is used for storage only, is not placed within the front yard setback, and complies with all intensity requirements of Section 2.5.  Portable warehouses which might be in place and utilized on the effective date of this section are in place in violation of Section 3.2.5 above and are not deemed to be non-conforming pursuant to G. L. c.40A, Section 6 or applicable provisions of this By-Law. 
 
3.2.5.2  Further notwithstanding the foregoing, portable warehouses/storage containers utilized in conjunction with permitted contractor’s yards and portable warehouse/storage container leasing and sales facilities may be permitted without a Special Permit provided they are not placed within the front yard setback. 
 
3.3 Home Occupations - A business or profession may be engaged within a dwelling unit only by a permanent resident thereof as an accessory use if the following conditions are met: 
 
3.3.1  No more than twenty-five percent of the floor area of the dwelling shall be used for the business or profession.

3.3.4  No offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat or glare shall be produced (See Section 3.6), nor shall other nuisance or hazard be created. 
 
3.3.5  Traffic generated shall not exceed volumes normally expected in a residential neighborhood. 
 
3.3.6  The parking generated shall be accommodated off-street, but not more than two spaces shall be in required front yard, and all spaces shall not occupy more than 35% of lot area. 
 
3.3.7  Such home occupation shall not include barber shops, beauty parlors, commercial kennels, or the sale of articles produced off the premises; provided, however, a barber shop or beauty parlor may be allowed upon the issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals. 
 
3.3.8  A home occupation permit shall be issued by the Building Commissioner.  Such permit shall be issued for a period not to exceed three years, and shall be renewable upon application filed with the Commissioner. 
 
3.4  Parking Requirements - The following requirements shall apply to all premises in all districts except the CA district which is exempt. Adequate off-street parking must be provided on paved surfaces to service all parking demands created by new structures or uses, additions to existing structures or uses, and changes of use in existing structures. Such parking shall be on the same lot as the activity or use it services.

6.3 Standards:  The Planning Board may only grant a PRD Special Permit for applications that meet the provisions of this Article VI, and of Sections 1.10 and 1.15 of this By-Law. 
 
6.4 Requirements 
 
6.4.1 Minimum Tract Size:  The size of the tract to be developed as a PRD shall be a minimum of 5 contiguous acres in the RB District, or 10 contiguous acres in the RC and RD Districts. 
 
6.4.2 Dwelling Style:  A maximum of four (4) dwelling units per structure shall be permitted in structures that, to the extent feasible, resemble single-family residences. 
 
6.4.3 Density:  The maximum number of dwelling units shall be determined by dividing 85% of the total area of the site by the minimum lot size of the zoning district in which the site is located.  Said number of units shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.   
 
6.4.3.1   Density Bonus:  The maximum number of dwelling units as calculated in Section 6.4.3 of this Article VI may be exceeded provided the Planning Board determines that the proposed PRD includes the provision of substantial facilities that clearly provide an overriding public benefit.  Substantial facilities that clearly provide an overriding public benefit are: 
 
6.4.3.1.1  The provision of at least 25% of the total number of dwelling units as deed restricted in perpetuity for occupancy by two persons only, at least one of which is 55 years of age or older; 
 
6.4.3.1.2  The provision of at least 25% of the total number of dwelling units that are deed restricted in perpetuity for the sale to persons who qualify as low- or moderate-income as determined by Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development; or, 
 
6.4.3.1.3  On tracts of 25 acres or larger, the construction of substantial public recreation facilities (regulation athletic fields, regulation tennis courts, municipal parks with community center or public assembly facility, and golf courses) to be deeded upon completion to the Town.  Any substantial public recreation facility shall include adequate off-street parking, public access, and restroom facilities as determined by the Planning Board.  Substantial public recreation facilities shall be considered part of the required Common Open Space (COS).  Such facilities may be constructed upon a site or sites owned by the Town, so long as approved by the Board or agency having jurisdiction thereof and so long as equivalent land area within the tract shall be offered for transfer to the Town. 
 
6.4.3.1.4  In lieu of the requirements of Section 6.4.3.1.3 herein, an applicant may make payment to the Town in the form of a Facilities Improvement Grant in an amount to be determined by the Planning Board, after consultation with the Finance Committee.  Said grant monies shall be paid at a time and in a manner approved by the Planning Board, and to be utilized by the Town only for the purposes of providing new facilities in the town, or for the substantial rehabilitation of existing municipal facilities.  The specific facilities to be constructed or improved with such a grant shall be determined by the Planning Board.  In considering the extent of the facilities to be constructed or improved, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the density bonus sought and the overall magnitude of the proposed Planned Residential Development.  At the applicant’s expense, a third party architectural/engineering firm familiar with municipal facilities shall establish the value of such improvements including labor costs based on prevailing wage rates.  Said grant monies shall specifically not be used for routine maintenance or to otherwise supplement departmental operating budgets.  Such grants can provide an overriding public benefit and could further the objectives of providing substantial public facilities.  In instances where such a grant is utilized, land area within the tract equivalent to the land area of the facility benefiting from the grant may be required to be offered for transfer to the Town as Common Open Space.  The grant money an applicant is required to pay pursuant to this section shall, prior to utilization of any density bonus authorized hereunder, be either provided in full amount to the Town, or guaranteed as to payment through surety, letter of credit or other acceptable means of guarantee. 
 
6.4.3.2 The maximum density bonus under Sections 6.4.3.1.1 and 6.4.3.1.2 of this Article VI shall not exceed the addition of more than 50% of the number of dwelling units determined under Section 6.4.3 of this Article VI.  The actual density bonus may vary from site to site depending upon the physical and environmental characteristics of the site in question. 
 
6.4.3.3 The maximum density bonus under Section 6.4.3.1.3 of this Article VI shall not exceed the addition of more than:

ARTICLE VIII WIRELESS COMMUNICATION LINK 
 
8.1  PURPOSE 
 
The purpose of this Article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of Wireless Communication Links.  The goals are to: 
 
8.1(a) encourage the location of Wireless Communication Links in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of Wireless Communication Links throughout the community; 
 
8.1(b)  strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing Wireless Communication Link sites; 
 
8.1(c)  encourage users of Wireless Communication Links to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
 
8.1(d)  encourage users of Wireless Communication Link to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the Wireless Communication Link, and 
 
8.1(e)  enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunication services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
 
8.2 APPLICABILITY 
 
The requirements set forth in this Article shall govern the location of all new Building Mounted or Free-standing Wireless Communication Links. 
 
Only free-standing monopoles or man-made trees, are allowed as specified in Section 8.8.  Lattice style towers and similar facilities requiring three or more legs and/or guy wires for support are not allowed. 
 
Amateur radio towers used in accordance with the terms of any amateur radio service license issued by tile FCC are exempt from the provisions of this Article. 
 
8.3 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION LINKS 
 
Any Wireless Communication Link that is not operational for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the Wireless Communication Link shall be removed within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Building Commissioner notifying of such abandonment. 
 
If such Wireless Communication Link is not removed within ninety (90) days, such Wireless Communication Link shall be deemed to be in violation of this zoning By-Law and the appropriate enforce-ment authority may begin proceedings to enforce and/or cause removal. If there are two or more users of a single Wireless Communication Link, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the Wireless Communication Link. 
 
8.4 PRINCIPAL OR ACCESSORY USE 
 
A Wireless Communication Link may be considered either a principal or an accessory use.  A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of a Wireless Communication Link on such lot.  For purposes of determining whether the installation of a Wireless Communication Link complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the Wireless Communication Link may be located on leased parcels within such lots.  A Wireless Communication Link that is constructed or installed in accordance with the provisions of this By-Law shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.  A Wireless Communication Link may not take away required parking spaces of an existing building. 
 
8.5 CO-LOCATION OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT 
 
All owners and operators of land used in whole or in part for a Wireless Communication Link and all owners and operators of such Wireless Communication Link shall, as a continuing condition of installing, constructing, erecting and using a Wireless Communication Link, permit other public utilities or FCC licensed commercial entities seeking to operate a Wireless Communication Link to install, erect, mount and use compatible Wireless Communication equipment and fixtures on the equipment mounting structure, or on the same lot in close proximity as is practical to the existing structure, on reasonable commercial terms provided that such co-location does not materially interfere with the transmission and/or reception of communication signals to or from the existing Wireless Communication Link, and provided that there are no structural or other physical limitations that make it impractical to accommodate the proposed additional Wireless Communication equipment or fixtures and subject to all other provisions of this By-Law. 
 
8.5.1  In the event that a wireless communication provider seeks to co-locate upon such Wireless Communication Link and is unable to do so because of unreasonable delay or commercially unreasonable terms or conditions imposed by the permit holder, such provider may request for a determination by the special permit granting authority as to whether the Co-location Condition has been violated.  If the special permit granting authority, after holding a public hearing which provides the permit holder with an opportunity to be heard, decides that such Co-location Condition has been violated, then the permit granting authority shall have the right to enforce the condition by revoking the special permit and/or imposing fines in accordance with applicable Law.

Milford Water Company 
Information Regarding Extension of Water Service 
 
1. GENERAL 
 
A plan of a subdivision approved by the Milford Planning Board, must be submitted to the Water Company as the first requisite for service to a new subdivision.  Arrangements must be made with the Water Company regarding acceptable materials and installation.  A valid agreement with the Water Company must be signed prior to installation covering title to facilities and financial terms. 
 
2. REGARDING MATERIALS AND INSTALLATION 
 
Installation shall not be started until street boundaries have been accurately marked by survey so that mains, hydrants and service valves can be placed in proper location. 
 
Water mains shall be connected at all streets entering a subdivision.  If no water main exists on the street entering or bordering a subdivision the subdivision water main must be installed to the boundary of the subdivision. 
 
Water mains within a subdivision shall be connected wherever streets are connected.  Dead-end mains will not be permitted except where the Planning Board has permitted a permanently dead-ended street. 
 
The standard size for water mains shall be eight inch diameter except that larger sizes may be required by the Water Company to insure adequate hydrant flows or domestic pressure now or in the future.  Water service pipes shall not be angled off to the last houses. 
 
All water pipes shall be covered to a depth of five feet. 
 
Water service pipes from main to house shall be minimum one inch diameter. 
 
All water facility installations shall be inspected during installation by Water Company personnel. 
 
Hydrant locations are determined by the Milford Fire Chief and the subdivision should be submitted to him for this information.
