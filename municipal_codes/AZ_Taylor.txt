The denial shall be without prejudice to the right of the applicant to re-apply for the same license.

E. Additional Requests/Extension of Time Frames. A.R.S. section 9-835(G) permits the town to make one comprehensive request for additional information during substantive review, but allows mutual agreement authorizing the town to make more than one comprehensive written or electronic request for additional information during the substantive review time frame. A.R.S. section 9-835(H) permits the applicant and town to mutually consent to the extension of the substantive review and overall time frames for up to 25 percent of the overall time frame.

Any such agreement shall be written and executed by the director of each department, office or agency.

[Ord. 2012-01.]

A. Purpose.

B. Hearing Officer. The Taylor town council hereby establishes the position of hearing officer to hear and decide all appeals of decisions denying any application for license pursuant to this chapter. This position of hearing officer may (but is not required to) be filled by the town manager at the Taylor town council’s discretion.

5.10.010 Findings.

Based on public testimony and other evidence before it, including information, studies and court decisions from other jurisdictions, and in accordance with A.R.S. section 9-461, the town of Taylor makes the following legislative findings and statement of purpose: The town of Taylor recognizes that some activities which occur in connection with adult-oriented businesses are protected as expression under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The town of Taylor further recognizes that First Amendment rights are among our most precious and highly protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights. The town is aware, however, that adult-oriented businesses may and do generate secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Among these secondary effects are (A) prostitution and other sex-related offenses, (B) drug use and dealing, (C) health risks through the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and (D) infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of drug- and sex-related business activities, laundering of money and other illicit conduct. This chapter is not intended to interfere with legitimate expression but to avoid and mitigate the secondary effects enumerated above. Specifically, the town of Taylor finds the licensing of persons who operate and manage adult-oriented businesses and persons who provide adult services will further the goals of this chapter by enabling the town to ascertain if an applicant is underage or has engaged in criminal or other behavior of the sort this chapter is designed to limit. This information will enable the town to allocate law enforcement resources effectively and otherwise protect the community. The town of Taylor finds that limiting proximity and contact between adult service providers and patrons promotes the goal of reducing prostitution and other casual sexual conduct and the attendant risk of sexually transmitted diseases. The town of Taylor finds the foregoing to be true with respect to places where alcohol is served and where it is not. The town of Taylor finds that individual and interactive sexual activities in adult video facilities pose a risk of sexually transmitted disease, especially AIDS, and that the booth configuration options of this chapter will reduce that risk. The town of Taylor finds that the harmful secondary effects of adult-oriented businesses are more pronounced when conducted continuously or during late night hours. The fees established for licenses and permits in this chapter are based on the estimated cost of implementation, administration, and enforcement of the licensing program. [Ord. 49 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 16-1-1.]

Article XI. Cross-Connection Control


13.05.430 General policy.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is:

1. To protect the public potable water supply of the town of Taylor from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer’s private water distribution system(s) or the customer’s private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system; and

2. To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the customer’s in-plant potable water system(s) and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and

3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.

B. Responsibility. The water system operator shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said water system operator an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the customer’s water service connection; or within the customer’s private water system) for the safety of the water system, the water system operator or his/her designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(ies) at specific location(s) on his/her premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved assembly(ies) at his/her own expenses; and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain said assembly(ies) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. [Ord. 44, 1995. Code 1983 § 11-11-1.]


13.05.440 Definitions.

“Approved” means accepted by the authority responsible as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this article or as suitable for the proposed use.

“Auxiliary water supply” means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor’s approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor’s public potable water supply or any natural source(s), such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor and so forth; used waters; or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which purveyor does not have sanitary control.

“Backflow” means the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system as a result of a cross-connection.

“Backflow preventer” means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.

1. “Air gap” means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet conveying water or waste to a tank, plumbing fixture, receptor or other assembly and the flood level rim of the receptacle. These vertical, physical separations must be at least twice the diameter of the water supply outlet, never less that one inch (25 mm).

2. Reduced-Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly. The approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly consists of two independently acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between two tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves as an assembly and equipped with properly located resilient-seated test cocks.

3. Double Check Valve Assembly. The approved double check valve assembly consists of two internally loaded check valves, either spring-loaded or internally weighted, installed as a unit between two tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves and fittings with properly located resilient-seated test cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against a nonhealth hazard (that is, a pollutant).

“Back pressure” means a pressure, higher than the supply pressure, caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or any other means that may cause backflow.

“Backsiphonage” means backflow caused by negative or reduced pressure in the supply piping.

“Contamination” means an impairment of a potable water supply by the introduction or admission of any foreign substance that degrades the quality and creates a health hazard.

“Cross-connection” means a connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water system and any other environment containing other substances in a manner that, under any circumstances, would allow such substance to enter the potable water system. Other substances may be gases, liquids or solids, such as chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or nonpotable), or any matter that may change the color or add odor to the water.

“Cross-connection control by containment” means the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly at the water service connection to any customer’s premises, where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer’s water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer’s water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection.

“Cross-connections, controlled” means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

Hazard, Degree of. This term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.

1. “Hazard, health” means a cross-connection or potential cross-connection involving any substance that could, if introduced into the potable water supply, cause death, illness, spread disease or have a high probability of causing such effects.

2. “Hazard, plumbing” means a plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer’s potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air gap or an approved backflow prevention assembly.

3. “Hazard, nonhealth” means a cross-connection or potential cross-connection involving any substance that generally would not be a health hazard but would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable, if introduced into the potable water supply.

4. “Hazard, system” means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer’s potable water system or of a pollution or contamination that would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.

“Industrial fluids system” means any system containing a fluid or solution that may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form of concentration, such as would constitute a health, system, pollution or plumbing hazard, if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system that may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulating cooling waters connected to an open cooling tower; and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such as wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, and so forth; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions, and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes for firefighting purposes.

“Pollution” means the presence of any foreign substance in water that tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a nonhealth hazard or impair the usefulness of the water.

“Service connection” means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, that is, where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer’s water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the “service connection” shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the customer’s water system. Service connection shall also include water service connections from the public potable water system.

“Water commissioner” or “health official” means the water system operator in charge of the water department of the town of Taylor who is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

“Water, nonpotable” means water that is not safe for human consumption or that is of questionable quality.

“Water, potable” means water that is safe for human consumption as described by the public health authority having jurisdiction.

“Water, used” means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer’s water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor. [Ord. 44, 1995. Code 1983 § 11-11-2.]


13.05.450 Requirements.

A. Water System.

1. The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the utility system and the customer system.

2. The utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer’s system begins.

3. The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the distribution system.

4. The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer’s system.

5. The customer’s system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the utility distribution system that are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.

B. Policy.

1. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this article is not installed, tested and maintained or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.

2. The customer’s system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to an authorized representative of the Taylor municipal water department to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the water system operator shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

3. An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer’s water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:

a. In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the water system operator, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard.

b. In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality.

c. In the case of premises having (i) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (ii) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line.

4. The type of protective assembly required under subsections (B)(3)(a), (b) and (c) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows:

a. In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection (B)(3)(a) of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.

b. In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.

c. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.

d. In the case of any premises where there are “uncontrolled” cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.

e. In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises.

f. In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the water system operator, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the water system operator may require an air-gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the water system operator and is dependent on the degree of hazard.

5. Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the water system operator. The term “approved backflow prevention assembly” shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association titled:

a. AWWA C510-89 – Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow-Prevention Assembly; and

b. AWWA C511-89 – Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle Backflow-Prevention Assembly;

and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California established by “Specification of Backflow-Prevention Assemblies,” Section 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control.

Said AWWA and FCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the water system operator. Final approval shall be evidenced by a “certificate of approval” issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCHR specifications.

The following testing laboratory has been qualified by the water system operator to test and certify backflow preventers:

Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research

University of Southern California

University Park

Los Angeles, CA 90089

Testing laboratories, other than the laboratory listed above, will be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the water system operator.

Backflow preventers that may be subjected to back pressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory’s current list of approved backflow prevention assemblies may be used without further testing or qualification.

6. It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the water system operator deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester approved by the Taylor municipal water department. It shall be the duty of the water system operator to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the water system operator in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the customer-user may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the water system operator.

7. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (B)(6) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water system operator is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section. [Ord. 44, 1995. Code 1983 § 11-11-3.]1

14.05    General Regulations

14.10    Definitions

14.15    General Provisions

14.20    Administration

14.25    Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction

14.35    Variance Procedure


Chapter 14.05 GENERAL REGULATIONS

Sections:

14.05.010    Statutory authorization.

14.05.020    Findings of fact.

14.05.030    Statement of purpose.

14.05.040    Methods of reducing flood losses.


14.05.010 Statutory authorization.

In A.R.S. section 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the town of Taylor, Arizona, to assume the powers and duties for floodplain management and adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. section 48-3609 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the town council of Taylor, Arizona, does ordain as follows. [Ord. 2015-02.]


14.05.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of the town of Taylor are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. [Ord. 2015-02.]


14.05.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding;

G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;

H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions;

I. Participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and disaster relief. [Ord. 2015-02.]


14.05.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this title includes methods and provisions to:

A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. [Ord. 2015-02.]

“Flood or flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: (1) the overflow of floodwaters; (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition.

“Floodplain administrator” means the community official, the Zoning Administrator, designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain board” means the town council of the town of Taylor, Arizona, at such times as they are engaged in the enforcement of this title. (“Floodplain board” as defined in A.R.S. section 48-3601 for counties.)

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this title and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas.

“Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

“Floodway” means the area of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Floodway fringe” means that area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Hardship,” as related to Chapter 14.35 TTC, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The town council of the town of Taylor, Arizona, requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

b. Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. See “Basement.” An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this title.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Market value” shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed.

1. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry.

2. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

“New construction” means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial Flood Insurance Rate Map or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

“One-hundred-year flood” or “100-year flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See “Base flood.”

“Person” means an individual or the individual’s agent, a firm, partnership, association or corporation, or an agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

14.35.010 Nature of variances.

The variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners.

It is the duty of the town council of the town of Taylor, Arizona, to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. [Ord. 2015-02.]


14.35.020 Appeal board.

A. The floodplain board of the town of Taylor, Arizona, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this title.

B. The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title.

C. In passing upon such applications, the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this title, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive or general plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges.

D. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (C) of this section and the purposes of this title, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title.

E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and

3. The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by A.R.S. title 26, chapter 2, article 2. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Navajo County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

F. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. [Ord. 2015-02.]


14.35.030 Conditions for variances.

A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of Chapters 14.20 and 14.25 TTC have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

E. Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3. Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in Chapter 14.10 TTC in the definition of “functionally dependent use”; and

4. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. [Ord. 2015-02.]

F. In applying the principle of compatibility the commission shall consider the following factors:

1. The general “design” character and appropriateness to the property of the proposed alteration or new construction;

2. The scale of proposed alteration or new construction in relation to the property itself, surrounding properties and the neighborhood;

3. Texture, materials, and color and their relation to similar features of other properties in the neighborhood;

4. Visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including proportion of the property’s front facade, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings with the facade, roof shape, and the rhythm of spacing of properties on streets, including setback;

The commission’s decision shall state the reasons for denying or modifying any application. [Ord. 60 § 2, 2001. Code 1983 § 19-1-8.]


15.15.090 Hardship criteria.

An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed alternation has been denied may apply for relief on the grounds of hardship. In order to prove existence of hardship, the applicant shall establish that the property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible. [Ord. 60 § 2, 2001; Ord. 54 § 9, 1999. Code 1983 § 19-1-9.]


15.15.100 Hardship application procedure.

C. The applicant shall consult in good faith with the commission, local preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property.

D. All decisions of the commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent to the applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the town clerk’s office for public inspection. The commission’s decision shall state the reasons for granting or denying the hardship application. [Ord. 60 § 2, 2001; Ord. 54 § 10, 1999. Code 1983 § 19-1-10.]


15.15.110 Maintenance and repair required.

A. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a landmark or property within a historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, color or outward appearance.

B. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark or included within a historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would in the judgement of the historical preservation commission have a detrimental effect upon the character of the historic district as a whole or the life and character of the property itself.

C. Examples of such deterioration include:

1. Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;

2. Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members;

3. Deterioration of exterior chimneys;

4. Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar;

5. Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or foundations, including broken windows or doors;

6. Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition, which could lead to the claim that demolition is necessary for the public safety. [Ord. 60 § 2, 2001; Ord. 54 § 11, 1999. Code 1983 § 19-1-11.]


15.15.120 Violations.

A. Violation of any requirement or prohibition stated in this chapter or in the public record known as “The Town of Taylor Historic Preservation Code” is a Class 2 misdemeanor, punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $750.00 or by imprisonment for not more than four months. With respect to a violation that is continuous in nature, each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. Any person who demolishes, alters, constructs or permits a designated property to fall into a serious state of disrepair in violation of this chapter shall be required to restore the property and its site to its appearance prior to the violation. Any action to enforce this subsection shall be brought by the town attorney. This civil remedy shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution and penalty. This provision shall not apply to the town of Taylor.

B. Improvements may be waived in the following situations:

1. For lot line adjustments where no new lot is created;

2. For a map of dedication;

3. When the division is to allow the construction of a single-family dwelling or manufactured home and the public works director determines that less than 50 percent of the half-street right-of-way for the side of the block on which the property is located would be improved as a result of such condition; or

4. In any case where the public works director determines that the improvement of all the abutting street or the installation of all other normally required improvements would be impractical because of considerations such as, but not limited to: type and extent of existing street improvements; inability to establish a proper street grade or alignment; physical barriers such as excessive terrain grade or washes, buildings or other structures; or other special circumstances where, in the opinion of the public works director, the immediate installation of the improvements is not deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and that the waiver of the improvement requirements would not impair the purpose and intent of this title. Provided, however, under no condition will the requirement to extend and install sewer and water be waived, if said are available.

5. The planning official may require, as a condition for the waiver of the required improvements, the execution of an acceptable form of assurance to the town of Taylor attesting that the owner(s) and their heirs, successors, or assigns agree that they will participate in the cost of the improvements abutting their property at a later date whenever it is deemed necessary by the town based on future development in the immediate area.

For the promotion and protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the public health, peace, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare and in order to secure for the citizens of the town of Taylor, Arizona, the social and economic advantages of an orderly, efficient use of land, and as a part of the master plan for the town, there is hereby adopted and established an official land use plan and zoning ordinance for the town of Taylor, Arizona, and rules, regulations and plans by which the future growth and development of the town may be directed in a manner that recognizes the town’s heritage and protects past rights in accordance with the plan and ordinance, as provided in A.R.S. section 9-461.08.

B. Title. These regulations shall be known as the town of Taylor zoning ordinance, may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as “title.”

C. Adoption. This title is adopted as the town of Taylor zoning ordinance relating to comprehensive planning and zoning, pursuant to provisions of Arizona law, including A.R.S sections 9-462 and 9-462.01 to 9-462.07, inclusive.

D. Purpose. The purpose of this title is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town of Taylor by guiding, controlling, and regulating the design, location, use, quality and occupancy of all buildings, structures and property within the town limits.

E. Coordination with General Plan. The enforcement of, amendments to, and the administration of this title shall be accomplished in accordance with the recommendations contained in the town of Taylor general plan, as developed and amended on a regular basis by the town council.

F. Scope. Except for work related to the provision of essential public services, or work located primarily in a public way, or as otherwise provided herein, no land may be divided, no structure shall hereafter be used, erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, repaired or improved; nor shall any land be used, except in conformity with this title; and before any such activity is undertaken, zoning clearance approval and/or a building permit shall be obtained from the town. Further, no person shall divert, retard, or obstruct the flow of waters in any watercourse whenever it creates a hazard to life or property without first securing a zoning clearance and/or a building permit.

1. Any use changed or altered in any significant manner, substantially decreased in production, or terminated or removed for a period exceeding six months will be required to submit a new site plan prior to restarting or resuming full production.

2. Every application for a zoning clearance must be accompanied by a scaled drawn site plan as required by this title or the planning and zoning administrator. All town departments, officials and employees charged with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall refuse to issue permits or licenses affecting land or structures in conflict with any provision of this title.

G. Internal Inconsistencies. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this title or any other town ordinance or code specify different requirements, the more restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall apply.

H. Repeals. All ordinances, or parts of ordinances, previously adopted by the town of Taylor which are in conflict with this title are repealed.

I. Private Agreements. The provisions of this title are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements (such as deed restrictions or conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs)) between private parties when such easements, covenants or other agreements are more restrictive or otherwise not in conflict with this title. When such easements, covenants or other agreements are less restrictive or otherwise in conflict with this title, this title shall prevail.

J. Guiding Principles. The following principles and rules are hereby adopted as a guide in the use and application of this title:

1. The powers of the town council, the planning and zoning commission, the zoning inspector and all other persons or agencies charged with the administration of this title shall be strictly limited by the expressed intent of the Legislature in the enactment of the Planning and Zoning Act of 1949, and by the language of this title.

2. All terms used herein shall be interpreted according to their common, plain, natural and accepted usage when not otherwise defined herein.

3. In any dispute concerning the application of any provision of this title that solution shall be favored which is most reasonable with regard to the general purpose of this title and the established and accepted principles of American planning and zoning law.

4. The application of this title to any property or use classified herein shall be governed by all the particular facts in each individual case, and the fundamental rights of any individual owner shall not be prejudiced by reason of his being in a minority, either in number or in land interests concerned in the application.

5. The right of every affected property owner to petition and to be heard whenever the application of this title is at issue shall be strictly observed at all times.

6. No special favors or privileges shall be granted to any individual or group of property owners and no permit shall be issued under the terms of this title which will or might reasonably tend to destroy the established economic or social uses and values of adjacent or surrounding properties.

On every application of this title to any given area, the relative importance of the interests involved shall be as follows:

a. First, established conforming uses of adjacent or surrounding properties having an equal or higher classification;

b. Second, the cost of tax-supported and other public services to the area affected, and the increased or decreased share of this cost which might be borne by the area if a proposed use or change of classification is permitted; and

c. Third, the value of the proposed classifications and uses to the orderly development of the neighborhood or area affected.

7. The theory and use of “spot” zoning is hereby specifically repudiated in the application of any classification of this title to any given land area. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 12-1-1.]

A. To ensure orderly planning and review procedures that will result in superior design, with variety in architectural and site design using techniques including, but not limited to, variations in building styles, setbacks, lot arrangements, and site planning;

B. To promote economical, innovative, and efficient land use, with emphasis on utilizing existing infrastructure, improving amenities, with appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design, and sensitivity to the surrounding land uses and the natural environment;

C. To provide for a zoning district that encompasses a broad range of land uses including, but not limited to, single-family and multifamily residential, professional and administrative offices, retail, service, hotel and resort, light industrial or employment, recreational, and any public or semi-public use or combination of uses through the adoption of a master development plan (MDP) which sets forth land use relationships, development standards, and goals consistent with the town of Taylor general plan;

D. To encourage a more creative approach to land utilization by creating efficient, aesthetic, and desirable developments, which may be characterized by incorporating special features of the geography, topography, size, uses, or shape of a particular property into its site planning;

E. To permit flexibility in design standards so that a PAD produces a choice in the type of environment, living units, commercial installations, and other facilities available to the public while maximizing efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open space;

F. To promote a unique yet compatible development that is in harmony with the surrounding land uses and the goals of the town of Taylor general plan;

G. To provide a device for averaging residential density over an entire parcel and placing no restrictions on lot size or dwelling types, as long as the total density does not exceed the maximum approved in the MDP; and

H. To provide standards to ensure that PAD projects are developed with high-quality, integrated site design, complementary building architecture, efficient and safe traffic circulation, appropriate landscaping, preservation of significant natural features, and attractive site amenities.

18.40.030 General requirements and standards.

A. The land uses and design of the proposed PAD shall be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies as described in the town general plan.

B. The provisions of Chapter 18.75 TTC, Administrative Procedures, shall be replaced with the requirement for a PAD with the submission of a master development plan (MDP) as described in this section.

C. The uses allowed within each PAD shall be limited to those listed in the approved MDP for that development. The number of dwelling units and/or gross commercial/industrial square footage shall also be limited by the approved MDP.

D. In general, a variety of housing types shall be encouraged for residential planned area developments, so as to provide for the diverse needs of the community. Parcel densities within the PAD may be flexible as long as the maximum number of dwelling units established for the entire PAD is not exceeded.

E. Generally smaller, infill-type PADs, which include only one housing type, such as all detached or all attached units, or one type of commercial use, shall not be considered inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this section and shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval of the PAD. The overall quality of the development and compatibility with surrounding development shall be considered in the evaluation of an infill PAD.

F. Commercial development in a PAD may provide for a variety of commercial and/or industrial/employment uses. The total square footage for commercial/industrial uses may be flexible from parcel to parcel within the maximum allowable number of square feet of commercial/industrial usage for the entire PAD as established by the MDP.

G. Development which includes a mix of residential and commercial and/or other nonresidential uses shall include specific standards in the MDP to address the manner in which compatibility of uses is established.

H. General provisions of the zoning ordinance shall apply for any general development standards not specifically a part of the PAD approval.

I. There is no minimum size for a proposed PAD site; however, if proposed for an infill or redevelopment site, the size of a PAD will be reviewed in the context of the property’s location and surrounding uses.

J. There shall be no minimum lot size requirement for individual lots; however, proposed lot sizes will be reviewed in the context of the general plan goals and objectives for that property, as well as the overall site plan, building layout and design quality for the development.

K. Proposed standards shall be reviewed and approved based upon compatibility with adjacent land uses, the placement of buildings within the parcel, and conformance with building codes and fire safety requirements.

L. Land uses on the perimeter of the PAD shall be designed and developed to be compatible with and complementary to the existing and planned development reflected on the general plan in the immediate vicinity of the proposed PAD.

M. PADs located on the perimeter of the town boundary or abutting National Forest lands or designated open space shall provide an appropriate approach for transition and/or buffering between abutting land uses so as to ensure appropriate compatibility of uses. Such transition may be addressed by stepping down the density of residential development, providing additional development setbacks and/or additional open space and landscape buffering between the PAD development and abutting land uses.

N. PADs located adjacent to National Forest lands, public parks or designated open space shall be evaluated to identify opportunities for providing nonmotorized trail access from within the development to abutting public lands. Locations for any such trail routes or access points shown on the PAD site plan shall be coordinated with the abutting land management agency to ensure appropriate planning and approval for their development.

O. Unless modified pursuant to this chapter, all PADs shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the town of Taylor zoning ordinance, the subdivision ordinance, and pertaining to off-site improvements and all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations, unless exceptions are specifically granted through the PAD rezoning process.

The landscaping shall be designed to enhance the aesthetic quality of the development and to integrate with the surrounding natural environment.

e. Neighborhood Design.

i. Indicate how the plan provides a coherent system of neighborhood elements, including interconnected residential blocks, orientation of homes to the street, open space and parks, and safe, convenient and interconnected pedestrian connections.

ii. Provide adequate buffering and/or screening from less compatible neighborhood elements, such as arterial and collector streets, and adjacent nonresidential uses.

8. Circulation Standards.

a. The arrangement, character, extent, grade, width, and location of all roadways, streets, bike paths, or trails shall conform to applicable town standards, unless adjusted for specific topographical or developmental conditions in accordance with an approved traffic engineering study.

b. The need to conduct a traffic impact study shall be based on the land use and size of the development. Residential development with 50 dwelling units or more in total and/or commercial development with 100,000 square feet in gross floor area or greater and/or industrial development with 200,000 square feet in gross floor area or greater, including all development approved for phased development, shall be subject to the requirements for conducting a traffic impact study.

c. The town engineer shall review the traffic impact study based on the following conditions:

i. Existing traffic problems or congestion;

ii. Public concerns regarding the development;

iii. Negative impacts on adjacent developments;

iv. The circulation conditions propose a deviation from town of Taylor standards; or

v. Other local issues that may be present.

d. Where the need for a traffic impact study has been identified, this study should be completed and submitted to the town engineer for review prior to the planning and zoning commission hearing. The developer shall estimate the numbers of trips generated by the development and confirm the category of the study with the town engineer before submitting the report. Traffic impact studies for the town of Taylor are classified into three categories:

i. Category I: developments that generate between 100 and 300 vehicle trips during any peak hour.

ii. Category II: developments that generate between 300 and 750 vehicle trips during any peak hour.

iii. Category III: developments that generate more than 750 vehicle trips during any peak hour.

e. Where such is not shown on the general plan, adopted transportation plan, specific area plan or preliminary plans, the arrangement of streets, bicycle facilities and trails shall provide continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets, bicycle facilities and trails in surrounding areas. Streets, bicycle facilities and trails shall be designed to make the best use of the land features and open space requirements, in addition to meeting public safety issues.

f. Planned development shall provide for adequate traffic circulation that incorporates the adopted town street functional classification system to handle the projected traffic volumes on the streets.

g. Individual home lots should not front onto collector or arterial streets.

Options include orienting the rear of lots to such streets, side orientation at local street intersections, and the creative use of open space, retention areas and screening techniques between the street and the rear of properties.

h. Neighborhood streets should be designed to enhance neighborhood integrity and safety, encourage pedestrian activity, and provide logical connections to major activity centers (e.g., parks, schools, recreation facilities). The local street pattern should emphasize traffic calming techniques with short loops, cul-de-sacs, and gently curving streets.

i. Streets and street systems within the proposed development need to be designed to provide interconnection with surrounding development and neighborhood streets. Linear streets that encourage cut-through traffic should be avoided unless they are specifically identified in the general plan as collector or arterial streets.

j. The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as established in the MDP based on town subdivision standards. Proposed streets shall extend or project existing streets at their same or greater width, but not at a width less than prescribed by the subdivision standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (B)(8)(j), streets that are narrower than permitted by subdivision standards may be approved if it can be demonstrated that a narrower street will serve the function of efficient site planning and convenience for the residents/occupants and still satisfy public safety issues.

k. Access to development fronting on state highways must be in compliance with ADOT standards, including the established access management plans for those routes. Documentation must be provided from ADOT to ensure compliance with standards and requirements.

l. Traffic calming techniques shall be incorporated in the street layout for planned area developments where such calming of traffic is deemed desirable for supporting neighborhood values and improved quality of life. Effective traffic calming programs combine physical design concepts in the engineering of the street environment with traffic management programs that alter driver behavior, so as to reduce neighborhood traffic speeds and/or cut-through volumes in the interest of improving street safety and general neighborhood values. Traffic calming techniques shall include the following:

i. The incorporation of traffic calming techniques shall be based on carefully considered engineering principles for the design, placement and spacing of such features, as described in standards and guidelines produced by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Institute for Transportation Engineers (ITE), or similarly recognized professional standards; and

ii. Traffic calming techniques shall include features such as intersection chokers, mid-block swellings, short block design, roadway deflections referred to as chicanes, traffic islands, center island refuges, textured pavement, speed tables, roundabouts, mini-circles and similar measures.

9. Open Space Standards.

a. Open space shall be designed as an integral part of the development. The designation of open space includes both undisturbed natural areas and developed landscape components. Open space should be designated to provide interconnection and continuity between undeveloped areas to the greatest extent possible so as to address the health of the environment, habitat protection and natural process. Additional objectives to be addressed by open space shall include buffering, screening, transition and similar design-based objectives.

b. Open space shall not be less than 30 percent of the gross acreage of the parcels within the PAD proposed for residential and mixed-use development, excluding public and private road rights-of-way; and not less than 10 percent of the gross acreage of the parcels within the PAD proposed for commercial or industrial development, excluding public and private road rights-of-way, unless off-setting community benefits are demonstrated and approved in the MDP. Specific parcel allocations of open space may be required as part of the 30 percent and 10 percent overall requirements.

c. Additional area for open space may be required as a condition of approval for PAD zoning based on the need for additional buffering between uses or the need to address preservation of unique natural aspects of the site, including washes, hillsides and other features identified as significant.

d. Open space shall be conceptually depicted on the MDP as:

i. Dedicated municipal use, public parks, and school sites;

ii. Bike paths, equestrian, and/or hiking trails;

iii. Public or private park and recreation areas;

iv. Floodway and floodplain areas designated as undeveloped areas;

v. Retention basins required to comply with the 100-year storm shall be counted as open space when improved or landscaped to be a cohesive and integral element of the overall landscape plan;

vi. Landscape yards that are adjacent to streets or common areas and that are designed as commonly maintained and interconnected areas;

vii. Development site enhancements, including landscapes and hardscaped areas, plazas, and courtyards; and

viii. Existing natural areas, including washes, drainage courses, riparian areas, hillsides, ridge lines, and other natural open space areas.

e. Required open space area shall not include any of the following:

i. Dedicated streets, alleys and other public rights-of-way, except that all landscaping within rights-of-way shall be included;

ii. Vehicular driveways, parking, loading, and storage areas;

iii. Reservation of municipal use, public park, or school sites which the governmental entity shall be required to purchase; only if such sites are dedicated as open space shall they constitute open space as defined above;

iv. Concrete channels or rock lined areas designed primarily as a drainage channel. This does not include natural washes that may include some areas with rip rap treatment or minor rock lined features to augment erosion control; and

v. Yards within residential areas of a PAD that are not otherwise included as part of a commonly maintained, integrated landscape.

10. Landscape Standards. Proposed landscape standards shall be in compliance with landscaping requirements of this chapter and the subdivision standards. Any variation proposed for the PAD must clearly indicate an improvement to the adopted subdivision standards. In addition, the following is required:

c. In addition to a master landscape plan for the development, provide graphic details for typical landscape installations, including development entry features, parks or common areas, building landscaping, parking lots, pedestrian walkways, typical streetscape and similar applications.

11. Statement of Water Use. For development that proposes to exceed the number of dwelling units allowed by the existing zoning classification, provide a statement comparing a likely range of water use for the proposed development in comparison to development under the current zoning. Contact the town of Taylor utilities department to obtain current data regarding average household water use for the town.

12. Phasing Plan. Describe proposed phasing of the development, if any, and indicate the phase lines on the site plan.

a. Interconnected public streets, sidewalks, drainage features and infrastructure may be required to be installed with the initial phase of development so as to adequately address public safety access, coherent development and functionality of facilities. The proposed phasing plan needs to indicate how adequate, safe, convenient and efficient circulation and infrastructure needs will be addressed with the phasing plan.

b. A PAD plan may be constructed in phases and the PAD narrative shall specify the phases of development, locations and timing of on-site and off-site improvements for each phase, as well as an estimated range of time for beginning and completion of each phase. Financial assurance shall be required for phases necessary to comply with general plan compliance.

c. Requests for minor modifications to the phasing plan shall be subject to approval by the director with a right of appeal to the town council.

d. The applicant may enter into a development agreement with the town providing for the timing, sizing, and funding of phased infrastructure improvements required for the PAD or may use any alternative mechanism acceptable to the town.

e. Disturbed areas approved for future phased development shall include dust free surfacing and/or temporary landscaping. Additional site treatments may be required for future development areas located next to public streets or adjacent to existing development.

“Approach surface” means a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in TTC 18.50.050. In plan the perimeter of the approach surface coincides with the perimeter of the approach zone.

Approach, Transitional, Horizontal, and Conical Zones. These zones are set forth in TTC 18.50.040.

Board of Adjustment. The town of Taylor town council shall serve as the board of adjustment.

“Conical surface” means a surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.

“Controlling jurisdiction” means the public agency or organization that is authorized to control land uses and implement zoning laws and regulations.

“Hazard to air navigation” means an obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.

Height. For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this title and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.

“Heliport primary surface” means the primary surface coincides in size and shape with the designated takeoff and landing area of a heliport. This surface is a horizontal plane at the elevation of the established heliport elevation.

“Horizontal surface” means a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone.

“Larger than utility runway” means a runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and jet powered aircraft.

NAVD 88 or North American Vertical Datum 1988. All elevations in this title are referenced to the 1988 North American Vertical Datum.

“Nonconforming use” means any preexisting structure, object of natural growth, or use of property and which is inconsistent with the provisions of this title or an amendment thereto.

“Nonprecision instrument runway” means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in nonprecision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.

18.50.040 Airport height restriction zones.

In order to carry out the provisions of this title, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Taylor Airport. Such zones are shown on the Taylor Airport height restriction overlay zoning map which is made part of and attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter. Said map was prepared by Armstrong Consultants and is dated October 21, 2003.

An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:

A. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach surface expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. The centerline of the approach zone is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

B. Nonprecision Instrument Runway Approach Zone (Larger Than Utility Runway). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

C. Nonprecision Instrument Runway Approach Zone (Utility Runway). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

D. Visual Runway Approach Zone (Larger Than Utility Aircraft). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. The centerline of the approach zone is a continuation of the centerline of the runway.

E. Visual Runway Approach Zone (Utility Aircraft). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. The centerline of the approach zone is a continuation of the centerline of the runway.

F. Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.

G. Horizontal Zones. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 or 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of the primary runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.

H. Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 3, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(3).]


18.50.050 Airport zone height limitations.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:

A. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet and continues on for a distance of 40,000 feet at a slope of 40 feet outward for each foot upward along the extended runway centerline.

B. Nonprecision Instrument Runway Approach Zone (Larger Than Utility Runway). Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

C. Nonprecision Instrument Runway Approach Zone (Utility Runway). Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

D. Visual Runway Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

E. Transitional Zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is established at 5,820 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.

F. Horizontal Zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or at a height of 5,970 feet above mean sea level.

G. Conical Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 4, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(4).]


18.50.060 Compatible land use regulations.

A. Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning Districts Established. For the purpose of regulating the development of noise sensitive land uses to promote compatibility between the airport and the surrounding land uses, to protect the airport from incompatible development and to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of property users, the controlled area of Taylor Airport is divided into airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts. The airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts established herein shall be known as:

	Abbreviated Designation	Zoning District Name

	AIZ	Airport influence zone

	TPZ	Traffic pattern zone

	AZ	Approach zone

B. Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning Map. The boundaries of the airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts set out herein are delineated upon the off airport land use drawing, said drawing being adopted by reference and made a part of this chapter as fully as if the same were set forth herein in detail.

C. Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zoning District Boundaries.

1. The airport compatible land use overlay zoning district boundary lines shown on the official airport compatible land use overlay zoning district map shall be located and delineated along contour lines established for the airport. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts as shown on the official map, the following rules shall apply:

a. Boundaries shall be scaled from the nearest physical feature shown on the map.

b. Boundaries may be scaled from the nearest platted lot line as shown on the map.

c. Distances not specifically indicated on the original airport compatible land use overlay zoning district map shall be determined by a scaled measurement on the map.

2. Where physical features on the ground differ from the information shown on the official airport compatible land use overlay zoning district map or when there arises a question as to how or where a parcel of property is zoned and such questions cannot be resolved by the application of subsection (C)(1) of this section, the property shall be considered to be classified as the most restrictive airport compatible land use overlay zoning district.

3. Where a parcel of land lies within more than one airport compatible land use overlay zoning district, the zone within which each portion of the property is located shall apply individually to each portion of the development.

D. Use of Land and Buildings.

1. Within the airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts as defined herein, no land shall hereafter be used and no structure or other object shall hereafter be erected, altered, converted, or modified other than for those compatible land uses permitted by underlying comprehensive zoning districts, as specified in the local land use code. Additional land uses are prohibited in the airport compatible land use overlay zoning districts, regardless of underlying zoning, as set forth in the land use compatibility table included as Attachment A at the end of this chapter.

2. Where any use of prohibited land and buildings set forth in subsection (D)(1) of this section conflicts with any other allowed land use or structure set forth in this title, this chapter shall apply.

3. This subsection (D) does not apply to property within the official boundaries of the airport.

4. Where specified on the airport compatible land use table, the property owner shall dedicate, in advance of receiving a building permit, an aviation easement to the controlling jurisdiction. The purpose of this easement shall be to establish a maximum height restriction on the use of property and to hold the public harmless for any damages caused by noise, vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles, or other effects that may be caused by the operation of aircraft landing at, taking off from, or operating on, or at, public airport facilities.

E. Additional Land Use Regulations.

1. Within the controlling jurisdiction the more restrictive of local land use code or subsection (D)(1) of this section shall apply to the development of all property covered by the airport compatible land use overlay zoning district map.

2. On property within the off airport land use drawing boundary, but outside the jurisdictional limits of the airport sponsor, subsection (D)(1) of this section shall apply to formulate land use recommendations or responses to land use comment requests from other jurisdictions.

3. When a provision of this section conflicts with any airport height hazard restrictions, the most restrictive provision shall apply.

4. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or other chapter of the local land use code, no use may be made of land, water, or structures within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, or result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport; impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport; create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, taking off, or flight operations of aircraft utilizing the airport.

5. When a subdivision plat is required for any property within an airport compatible land use overlay zoning district or within an area shown on the airport height restriction overlay zoning map for the controlling jurisdiction, the property owner shall dedicate an aviation hazard easement to the controlling jurisdiction over and across that property. This easement shall establish a height restriction on the use of the property and hold the public harmless from any damages caused by noise, vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles, or other effects that may be caused by the operation of aircraft taking off, landing, or operating on or near the airport. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 5, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(5).]


18.50.070 Nonconforming uses.

A. Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted.

B. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the town of Taylor council to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the town of Taylor. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 6, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(6).]


18.50.080 Permits.

A. Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in subsection (A)(1) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the regulating use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. An FAA Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration, shall accompany each application. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (D) of this section.

1. In the area lying within the limits of the approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone, no FAA Form 7460-1 shall be required by this chapter for any tree or structure less than 200 feet above ground level which is also lower than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward at a slope of 100 feet horizontal for each one foot vertical beginning at the closest point of the closest runway.

Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter.

B. Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of any obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.

C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the town of Taylor determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.

D. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the board of adjustments for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of a proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.

Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this chapter may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager or FBO for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager or FBO does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.

E. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as conditions may require in accordance with FAA provisions. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 7, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(7).]


18.50.090 Enforcement.

It shall be the duty of the planning and zoning administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to town of Taylor upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the planning and zoning administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for action by the board of adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the planning and zoning administrator. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 8, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(8).]

3. To hear and decide specific variances.

B. The board of adjustment shall consist of seven members, those members being the town council of the town of Taylor as required by this title.

C. The board of adjustment shall adopt rules for its governance and in harmony with the provisions of this chapter and the requirements of this title.

D. The board of adjustment shall make written findings of facts and conclusions of law giving the facts upon which it acted and its legal conclusions from such facts in reversing, affirming, or modifying any order, requirement, decision, or determination which comes before it under the provisions of this chapter.

E. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the board of adjustment shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the planning and zoning administrator or decide in favor of the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect variation to this chapter. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 95 § 9, 2004. Code 1983 § 12-2-9(9).]


18.50.110 Appeals.

A. Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by any decision of the planning and zoning administrator made in the administration of this chapter may appeal to the board of adjustment.

B. All appeals hereunder must be taken within a reasonable time as provided by TTC 18.70.030.

C. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the planning and zoning administrator certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would in the opinion of the planning and zoning administrator cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by the order of the board of adjustment on notice to the planning and zoning administrator and on due cause shown.

D. The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.

18.55.020    Terms and conditions.

18.55.030    Examples of qualifying uses.

18.55.040    Prohibited home occupations.


18.55.010 General.

A home occupation is an accessory use of a dwelling unit; conducted entirely within the dwelling unit, and carried on by one or more persons, one of which resides within the dwelling unit; provided, that the use is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for residence purposes and does not change the character thereof or adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential zoning district of which it is part. In general, a home occupation is an accessory use so located and conducted that the average neighbor, under normal circumstances, would not be aware of its existence. All storage associated with the home occupation is encouraged to be stored within the dwelling or its accessory structures, and any exterior storage must be screened from public view by an opaque wall or fence. Any indoor storage, construction, alterations, or electrical or mechanical equipment used for the home occupation shall not change the fire rating of the structure or the fire district in which it is located. It is the intent of this chapter to eliminate as home occupations all uses except those that conform to the standards set forth in this chapter. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 12-3-1.]


18.55.020 Terms and conditions.

Home occupations are a permitted accessory use in residential zoning districts only so long as all of the following conditions are observed:

A. Such occupation shall employ at least one person who resides within the residence;

B. No use shall require any internal or external alterations, include storage, involve construction features, or involve the use of any electrical or mechanical equipment that would change the fire rating of the structure or the fire district in which it is located;

C. All storage associated with the home occupation is encouraged to be located within the dwelling or its accessory structures. Any exterior storage shall be screened from public view by an opaque wall or fence (must be high enough to screen the storage area, with a maximum height of six feet);

D. No home occupation or use shall create noise, dust, vibration, smell, smoke, glare, electrical interference, fire hazard, traffic or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater or more frequent extent than that usually experienced in an average residential occupancy in the zoning district in question under normal circumstances wherein no home occupation exists; 

E. Signs associated with a home occupation are limited to one attached sign (six square feet maximum sign area) and one detached sign, per street frontage (six square feet maximum sign area with a maximum height above grade of four feet). Such signs are to be constructed and colored to be complementary to the residence;

F. Sufficient area for the parking of three vehicles is to be provided. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 12-3-2.]


18.55.030 Examples of qualifying uses.

The following are typical examples of uses which can be conducted within the limits of the restrictions established in this chapter and thereby qualify as a home occupation. Uses which may qualify as “home occupations” are not limited to those named in this section, nor does the listing of a use in this section automatically qualify it as a home occupation:

A. Accountant;

B. Architect;

C. Artist;

D. Attorney-at-law;

E. Author;

F. Barber, hair-styling;

G. Consultant;

H. Dress-making, alterations and tailoring;

I. Individual musical instrument instruction;

J. Individual tutoring;

K. Insurance;

L. Millinery;

M. Mobile repair businesses (work completed off site);

O. Preserving and home cooking;

P. Real estate sales. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 12-3-3.]


18.55.040 Prohibited home occupations.

The following are uses that by the nature of the investment of operation have a tendency to sometimes increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations and thereby impair the use and value of a residentially zoned area for residential purposes. Therefore, the following shall not be permitted as home occupations:

A. Automotive, RV and boat repair (minor or major), including body repair and painting;

B. Dental, chiropractic and medical offices;

C. Massage parlors. [Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 12-3-4.]

[Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 Art. 12-4.]


18.60.010 Use of lands, buildings and structures.

A. Conformity with Minimum Lot Area Required. Upon adoption of this chapter, no land may be split or subdivided so as to have an area which is less than the minimum lot area for the zoning district in which it is located, except that, where the dedication of right-of-way or the placement of an access easement or public utility easement has the effect of reducing the lot size, the gross lot area, prior to the dedication or placement, shall be used in determining minimum lot area.

B. Conformity with Certain Use Designations Required. No building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, altered, or enlarged for a use, nor shall any existing building, structure or part thereof, or land, be used for a purpose or in a manner that is not in conformity with the uses listed as permitted uses for the zone in which such building, structure, or land is situated subject to the provisions of this title, except that any land, building or structure may be erected or used for a purpose listed as a conditional use in such zone; provided, that a conditional use permit therefor is secured in accordance with the provisions of this title.

Additionally, no new construction shall commence without first obtaining a zoning clearance from the planning and zoning administrator.

C. Conformity with Height Limitations Required. No building, or part thereof, or structure shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered to exceed in height the limit herein designated for the district in which such building is located, except as specified in TTC 18.60.030(F) or permitted as a variance.

D. Conformity with Yard and Setback Regulations Required.

[Ord. 2018-02 § 1; Ord. 2016-02 § 1; Ord. 2011-04 § 4; Ord. 48 § 2, 1998. Code 1983 § 12-7-6.]


18.75.070 Variance procedures.

A. General. The planning and zoning commission may allow a departure from the terms of the zoning regulations contained in this title that pertain to height or width of structures, or the size of yard and open spaces where such departure will not be contrary to the public interest, and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property because of its size, shape or topography, and not as a result of any action of the applicant, the strict and literal enforcement of this title would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and/or building involved.

B. Application for a Variance. A request for a variance shall be made by filing an application with appropriate fees with the planning and zoning administrator at least 21 days prior to the planning and zoning commission meeting. Such application shall be accompanied by a site plan showing such information as the planning and zoning administrator deems necessary. The plans shall contain sufficient information for the board to make a proper decision on the request. The request shall state the exceptional conditions and the peculiar and practical difficulties claimed as a basis for a variance. In all cases, the application shall include:

1. Name and address of the applicant.

2. The legal description, including the tax assessor’s parcel number, of the property involved in the request for the variance, and the street address, if any, of the property.

3. The names and addresses of the owners of the property and any other persons having a legal interest in the property.

4. A site plan drawn to scale showing the property dimensions, adjacent streets, drive accesses, driveways and parking areas, sidewalks, grading, landscaping, existing and proposed buildings, and location of all utilities, as applicable.

5. The actual variance request and the reasons for the request.

6. Evidence of the ability and intention of the applicant to proceed with actual construction work in accordance with said plans within six months after issuance of the permit.

C. Notice of Public Hearing. The notice of public hearing and notification procedures for a variance shall conform to TTC 18.75.020.

D. Evidence Required for a Variance. At the public hearing on a variance application, the applicant shall present a statement and adequate evidence in such a form as the board may require showing:

1. That there are special circumstances or conditions applicable to the property referred to in the application which do not prevail on other property in that zone;

2. That the strict application of the regulations would work an unnecessary hardship and that the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial existing property rights;

3. That the granting of such application will not materially affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood, and will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood.

E. Planning and Zoning Commission Action. In the event the planning and zoning commission determines that substantial conformity to the standards previously established in the zoning district may be secured, and that detriment or injury to the neighborhood will not result from the granting of the variance applied for, the commission may, upon the affirmative vote of three-fourths of all the members of the commission, approve or conditionally approve a variance, or, by simple majority, postpone a decision on the variance request. A decision shall not be postponed for more than two consecutive meetings. Upon approval or conditional approval, the commission shall transmit notice of its action to the planning and zoning administrator, along with the issuance of a zoning clearance and/or building permit. A report of the commission’s findings and recommendations, and any conditions imposed or required, shall also be submitted promptly to the town council in the form of official minutes of the commission’s meeting(s).

2. Such appeal shall be forwarded to the town council for final determination and decision.

3. Such appeal shall be made within 15 calendar days of the decision of the planning and zoning commission, on a form as required by the planning and zoning administrator. Applicable fees shall be as required by the town.

4. Such appeal shall be subject to the notice provisions of TTC 18.75.020.

5. If the appeal of the denial of an application is denied by the town council, the denial shall constitute a finding that the applicant has not shown that the conditions required for approval do exist. No application for a conditional use permit which has been denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of the order of denial of such an appeal, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the council. Any resubmission on grounds of new evidence or changed conditions after denial of appeal shall be to the council.

G. Conditional Approval. In approving any variance, the planning and zoning commission may designate such conditions in connection therewith as will in its opinion substantially secure the objectives of the regulation or provision as to which such variance is granted, to provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the zone in which such permit is granted, and shall provide the planning and zoning administrator with a copy of the same.

H. Guarantees. Where necessary, the planning and zoning commission may require guarantees, in such form as it may deem proper under the circumstances, to ensure that the conditions designated in connection therewith are being or will be complied with. Where any condition under which a variance has been granted is violated, in the determination of the planning and zoning administrator, the variance shall cease to exist and the permit shall become null and void. Determination of the planning and zoning administrator may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission. Appeal shall be submitted within 30 days from date of determination.

The town council shall serve as the town’s hearing officer in appeals of required dedications and exactions. The application shall state the name and address (or town office) of the applicant and the reasons for filing the appeal. The application shall be made within 15 days of the date of the decision which is being appealed. The planning and zoning administrator shall then transmit to the board the complete record of the action for which the appeal is made. Appeals to the council may be made only in response to an action. There is no filing fee for an appeal as described in this section.

B. Stay of Proceedings. An appeal suspends the action taken and stays all proceedings in the matter, unless the town certifies that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. Upon such certification, proceedings shall not be stayed except by restraining order as injunctive relief granted by a court of record on application and notice to the town. Proceedings shall not be stayed if the appeal requests relief which has previously been denied except pursuant to a special action in superior court.

C. Notice of Hearing Required.

1. No appeal may be granted by the council until a public hearing has been held on the application. A notice of the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation, published or circulated within the town at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing.

2. If the appeal relates to a decision on a specific site, a similar notice shall be posted in conspicuous places close to or on the site affected, and shall be mailed at least 15 days prior to the hearing to each owner of the property situated within 300 feet of the property to which the appeal relates. The planning and zoning administrator shall be responsible for mailing the notice. For the purpose of giving mailed notice, the planning and zoning administrator shall require the applicant to furnish the names and addresses of all property owners within 300 feet of the property, and shall require the applicant to certify that the list represents the most current property owners as listed in the records of the Navajo County assessor’s office. Failure to receive notice by individual property owners will not necessarily invalidate the proceedings.

3. Notice of the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing shall be sent to the applicant at least seven days prior to the hearing date.

D. Review and Decision by the Council.

1. Within 45 days of the date of application, but no sooner than 15 days from the date of public notice, the council shall hear and decide arguments for appeal to the decision in question. The council shall consider oral or written statements from the appellant, his/her agent or attorney, the public and town staff members. The council shall also study the record of the action to which the appeal is related.

2. When addressing the appeal, the planning and zoning administrator (town) will bear the burden of proving that the dedications or exactions to be imposed on a property bear an essential nexus between the requirements and a legitimate governmental interest, and that the proposed dedication or exaction is roughly proportional to the impact of the use, improvement or development proposed by the applicant.

3. The council may, by three-fourths vote of the members present, approve or deny an appeal or, by simple majority, table the appeal. If tabled, the council shall make a decision on the appeal at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the council. A decision shall not be tabled for more than two consecutive meetings. The council may impose such conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to satisfactorily correct the situation in question, but it shall not attempt to infringe upon matters not specifically contained in the appeal.

E. Notice of Council Decision. The council shall issue a written notice of its decision to all concerned parties and to the planning and zoning administrator and the town clerk, who shall make official record of the decision. The notice shall state the facts of the matter as determined by the council, the reason for its decisions, and any conditions applied to the decision.
