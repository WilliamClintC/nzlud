PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Algonac, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Kellyn Wilcox, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Cynthia Greenia, former City Clerk, James Downey, City Attorney, and Douglas Alexander, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

A minor who violates this subsection is responsible for a municipal civil infraction or guilty of a misdemeanor as follows: 
(1) ?For the first violation, the minor is responsible for a municipal civil infraction and shall be fined not more than $100.00. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, and may order the minor to perform community service and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (e). A minor may be found responsible or admit responsibility only once under this subdivision. 
(2) ?If a violation of this subsection occurs after one prior judgment, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $200.00, or both. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (e). 
(3) ?If a violation of this subsection occurs after two or more prior judgments, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 60 days, if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, as applicable. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (e). 
(b) ?An individual who furnishes fraudulent identification to a minor or, notwithstanding subsection (a), a minor who uses fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both. 
(c) ?If an individual who pleads guilty to a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2) or offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in subsection (a)(3), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as provided for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18m, and section 1j of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.1j, and the costs of probation as prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this section is without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only one discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The secretary of state shall retain a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records shall be furnished to any of the following: 
(1) ?To a court, prosecutor, or police agency on request for the purpose of determining if an individual has already utilized this subsection.

a. ?At the time of the request, the individual is an employee of the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency, or an applicant for employment with the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency. 
b. ?The record is used by the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency only to determine whether an employee has violated his or her conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets criteria for employment. 
(d) ?A misdemeanor violation of subsection (a) successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed under subsection (c) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of subsection (a)(3). 
(e) ?A court may order an individual found responsible for or convicted of violating subsection (a) to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency as designated by the department-designated community mental health entity as defined in section 100a of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1100a, to determine whether the individual is likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. A court may order an individual subject to a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or placed on probation regarding, a violation of subsection (a) to submit to a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis. The parent, guardian, or custodian or a minor who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, may request a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis as part of the probation. 
(f) ?The secretary of state shall suspend the operator's or chauffeur's license of an individual convicted of a second or subsequent violation of subsection (a) or of violating subsection (2) as provided in section 319 of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.319. 
(g) ?A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a minor has consumed alcoholic liquor or has any bodily alcohol content may request that individual to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis. If a minor does not consent to a preliminary chemical breath analysis, the analysis shall not be administered without a court order, but a peace officer may seek to obtain a court order. The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis or other acceptable blood alcohol test are admissible in a state civil infraction proceeding or criminal prosecution to determine if the minor has consumed or possessed alcoholic liquor or had any bodily alcohol content. 
(h) ?A law enforcement agency, on determining that an individual who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed, possessed, or purchased alcoholic liquor, attempted to consume, possess, or purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily alcohol content in violation of subsection (a) shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of the individual as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall notify the parent, guardian, or custodian not later than 48 hours after the law enforcement agency determines that the individual who allegedly violated subsection (a) is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6. The law enforcement agency may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice including but not limited to, notice in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual less than 17 years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (a), his or her parents or legal guardian shall be notified immediately as provided in this subsection. 
(i) ?This section does not prohibit a minor from possessing alcoholic liquor during regular working hours and in the course of his or her employment if employed by a person licensed by this act, by the commission, or by an agent of the commission, if the alcoholic liquor is not possessed for his or her personal consumption.

Should the city council consider amendments to the proposed conditional rezoning advisable and if such contemplated amendments to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner, then the city council shall, in accordance with section 405 of the Michigan zoning enabling act (MCL 125.3405), refer such amendments to the planning commission for a report thereon within a time specified by the city council and proceed thereafter in accordance with said statute to deny or approve the conditional rezoning with or without amendments.

Sec. 50-46. - Approval.

(d) ?The approved statement of conditions or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof shall be filed by the city with the register of deeds of the county. The city council shall have authority to waive this requirement if it determines that, given the nature of the conditions and/or the time frame within which the conditions are to be satisfied, the recording of such a document would be of no material benefit to the city or to any subsequent owner of the land. 
(e) ?Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating use and development within the new zoning district as modified by any more restrictive provisions contained in the statement of conditions.

(2) ?The city council finds that there has not been a change in circumstances that would render the current zoning with statement of conditions incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise inconsistent with sound zoning policy. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 308(6), 3-5-1996) 
Sec. 50-49. - Reversion of zoning. 
    If approved development and/or use of the rezoned land do not occur within the time frame specified under section 50-48, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in the Michigan zoning enabling act (MCL 125.3405).

State Law reference Planned unit development, MCL 125.3503. 

Sec. 50-367. - Intent. 
    The Planned Development District (PD) is intended to permit the private or public development or redevelopment of acres throughout the city which shall be substantially in accord with the goals and objectives of the master plan of future land use for the city. The use patterns of the areas involved shall provide a desirable environment and shall be harmonious to the general surrounding uses permitting flexibility in overall development while ensuring the highest of safeguards and standards for public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. Such planned development district may embrace a mixture of one or more distinct uses or zoning categories, in the vertical or horizontal plane. A planned development district shall encourage the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability; conserve natural resources and energy; encourage innovation in land use planning; and bring about a compatibility of design and use. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1350, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. 2003-1, § 1350, 4-1-2003) 
Sec. 50-368. - Standards for planned development districts. 
(a) ?The uses proposed will have a beneficial effect, in terms of public health, safety, welfare or convenience or any combination thereof, on present and potential surrounding land uses. The uses proposed will encourage a more efficient use of public utilities and service and lessen the burden on circulation systems, surrounding properties, and the environment. This beneficial effect for the city (not the developer) shall be one which could not be achieved under any other single zoning classification. 
(b) ?The uses proposed shall be consistent with the master plan of future land use for the city. 
(c) ?The zoning is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development proposal. 
(d) ?Usable open spaces shall be provided, at least equal to the total of the minimum usable open space which would be required for each of the component uses of the development. The city may, if deemed appropriate, require for planned developments more or less open space than that required by this article. 
(e) ?Off-street parking sufficient to meet the minimum required by section 50-450 shall be provided and the city may, if deemed appropriate, require for planned developments more or less parking than that required by this article. 
(f) ?Landscaping shall be provided so as to ensure that proposed uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding public and private property. The city may, if deemed appropriate, require for planned unit developments more or less landscaping than that required by this article. 
(g) ?Vehicular and pedestrian circulation, allowing safe, convenient uncongested and well-defined circulation within and to the district shall be provided. 
(h) ?Natural and historical features of the district shall reasonably be protected and preserved. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1351, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. 2003-1, § 1351, 4-1-2003) 
Sec. 50-369. - Procedure for application. 
    Application shall be made to the city council for consideration under this district. The person applying shall be required to make a submittal of the following material for review and recommendation by the planning commission: 
(1) ?A property area survey of the exact area being required (scale: one inch equals 100 feet). 
(2) ?A proof of ownership of land being requested for rezoning. 
(3) ?A topographic map of the entire area at a contour interval showing two-foot changes in elevation. This map shall indicate all natural and manmade features (scale: one inch equals 100 feet). In those instances where more detailed topography is deemed necessary, the city may request a contour interval of one foot. Where extreme slopes exist, the city may allow a contour interval of five feet. 
(4) ?A preliminary plan of the entire area carried out in such detail as to show the land use being requested, the densities being proposed where applicable, the system of collector streets, and off-street parking system. 
(5) ?A preliminary plan layout or an overlay of such plan on a currently available aerial photo of the site and its immediate surroundings. 
(6) ?A written statement explaining in detail the full intent of the sponsor indicating the specifics of the development plan as it relates to the type of dwelling units contemplated and resultant population; the extent of nonresidential development and the resultant traffic generated and parking demands created, and providing supporting documentation, such as, but not limited to, market studies, supporting land use request, and the intended scheduling of development and such other studies as the city council or planning commission may require.

Sec. 50-370. - Acceptance and approval of preliminary (Stage I) site plan and rezoning. 
    Approval of the preliminary plan by the city council shall be effective for a period of two years, and such accepted plan may be renewed upon expiration of said two-year period, provided conditions have not changed that would be cause for denial of such extension. In reviewing and approving the plan, the following procedures and conditions shall be followed: 
(1) ?The preliminary plan shall be reviewed and a recommendation shall be made by the planning commission after public hearing to the city council relative to the plan, meeting the intent and the requirements of the master plan of future land use and for the rezoning of the property to PD district. Such rezoning shall be contingent on approved Stage II plans becoming part of such rezoning. The hearing for the preliminary plan may also, with proper notification and advertising, be the hearing for rezoning of the property to a planned development district. 
(2) ?Approval of the preliminary plan shall be given only after public hearing by the planning commission and shall not constitute final site plan approval. Rezoning procedures under this section will rely on the plan submitted for both Stage I and Stage II and the supporting documentation and the plan, therefore, is basic to the rezoning. 
(3) ?Once an area has been rezoned to a PD district, no development shall take place therein nor use made of any part thereof except in accordance with the preliminary plan as originally approved, or in accordance with an approved amendment thereto. 
(4) ?Approval of the preliminary plan by the city council shall not constitute approval of the final site plan. It shall be deemed as approval of the land use plan submitted and shall serve as a guide in the preparation of the final plan. 
(5) ?The proposed PD district shall be of such area as to represent a sound carrying out of the master plan of future land use, it not being the intention of this district that an unrelated parcel by parcel rezoning be effectuated. 
(6) ?The zoning ordinance amendment which effectuates the rezoning to the PD district shall refer to and incorporate by reference the Stage I site plan and the Stage II site plan and such zoning amendment shall be carried out in accordance with rezoning procedures of this article. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1353, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. 2003-1, § 1353, 4-1-2003) 
Sec. 50-371. - Final plan submittal (Stage II site plan) prior to building permit. 
    A presentation of the final site plan shall be made to the planning commission for review and recommendation to the city council of the following: 
(1) ?A final overall site plan for the entire area being requested under this PD district shall be submitted. This plan shall be worked out in detail showing specific uses, building location, off-street parking, street alignments, open spaces and other physical plan details being proposed. Supporting documentation in the form of building plans, and schedule of construction shall be submitted. The final site plan shall conform to all site plan requirements and all site plan review requirements of this article. 
(2) ?The final plan shall reflect and adhere to those use patterns as approved in the preliminary plan. Standards for building bulk and off-street parking shall be equal to at least the minimum standards set forth for like uses in article XVI of this chapter and off-street parking requirements of section 50-450. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1354, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. 2003-1, § 1354, 4-1-2003) 
Sec. 50-372. - Stage II site plan; approval of site plan. 
    Approval of the final site plan shall be effective for a period of three years. If development is not completed in this period, the planning commission shall review progress to date and make a recommendation to the city council as to action relative to permitting continuation under an extension of the original approval. In reviewing and approving the final plan, the following conditions shall be set forth: 
(1) ?A Stage II certificate of compliance may be granted by the city provided that the Stage II site plan is accepted and approved by the planning commission. 
(2) ?All dedications of the public rights-of-way or planned public open spaces shall be made prior to any construction taking place on the site and shall be recorded by the developer. 
(3) ?In residential use areas, any prorated open space shall be committed by dedication to an association of residents, either as rights-in-fee, easement, or in a master deed and retained as open space for park, recreation and related uses. All lands dedicated in fee or easement shall meet the requirements set forth by the city council. Provisions satisfactory to the city council shall be made to provide for the financing of any improvements by a means satisfactory to the city council. This may include a development agreement. Such documents shall be recorded with the county register of deeds. 
(4) ?In those instances where a subdivision plat or site condominium is being utilized as a planned development or a part of such development, the procedures and expiration dates of the land division act or condominium act shall govern.

Sec. 50-373. - General design standards. 
(a) ?All regulations applicable to setbacks, parking and loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall be met in relation to each respective land use in the development based upon zoning districts in which the use is listed as a permitted use or use permitted subject to special conditions. 
(b) ?Residential density shall be regulated as follows: 
(1) ?The maximum permitted residential density for single-family dwelling shall not exceed the density allowed for the R-2 single-family district. Yard setbacks for the R-2 district shall apply. 
(2) ?The maximum permitted residential density for multiple-family areas shall not exceed the requirements of the RM-2 district and shall meet setback requirements of the RM-2 district. 
(c) ?Requirements for height, bulk and density for all nonresidential uses shall be in accordance with zoning district standards most nearly reflecting policies in the city's master plan or as may be modified if appropriate by the city. 
(d) ?Density calculations shall meet the following requirements: 
(1) ?Land areas to be used in calculating gross residential density as provided in this section shall each be delineated on the Stage I plan and the Stage II plan so that the acreage and density computations can be confirmed. 
(2) ?The land area used for calculating gross residential density shall include the total residential land area designated on the plan, where applicable, less any area within existing public street rights-of-way. 
(3) ?The planning commission may require, as part of a final site plan review of a phase of a PD, that land shown as open space on the approved plan be held in reserve as part of the phase to be developed, in order to guarantee that density limits for the entire approved PD will not be exceeded when the subject phase is completed. Such reserved land may be included in the development of subsequent phases if the density limits will not be exceeded upon completion of that phase or if other land is similarly held in reserve. 
(4) ?The surface area of lakes, streams, ponds, (natural, manmade, or stormwater retention), marshlands, and similar areas may be included in the acreage used for calculating density if at least 50 percent of the frontage of such areas are part or lands devoted to parks and open space used for and accessible to all residents in the PD district. 
(5) ?Common open space, other common properties and facilities, individual properties, and all other elements of a PD district shall be so planned that they will achieve a unified open space and recreation area system, with open space and all other elements in appropriate locations, suitable related to each other, the site and surrounding lands. 
(e) ?To the maximum extent feasible, the development shall be designed so as to preserve natural resources and natural features. 
(f) ?There shall be a perimeter setback and berming, for the purpose of buffering the development in relation to surrounding properties. Such perimeter setback shall be established in the discretion of the planning commission taking into consideration the use or uses in and adjacent to the development. The setback distance need not be uniform at all points on the perimeter of the development. 
(g) ?Thoroughfare, drainage, and utility design shall meet or exceed the standards otherwise applicable in connection with each of the respective types of uses served. 
(h) ?There shall be underground installation of utilities, including cable, electricity and telephone, as found necessary by the city council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission. 
(i) ?Signage, lighting, landscaping, building architecture and materials, and other features of the project, shall be designed to achieve an integrated and controlled development, consistent with the character of the community, surrounding development or developments, and natural features of the area. 
(j) ?Where nonresidential uses adjoin residentially zoned property, noise reduction and visual screening mechanisms such as landscape berms and/or decorative walls shall be employed. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1356, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. 2003-1, § 1356, 4-1-2003) 
Sec. 50-374. - Required conditions. 
    Before approving the plan in either the preliminary Stage I site plan or final Stage II plan submittal, the planning commission and the city council shall determine that: 
(1) ?The cost of installing all streets, sidewalks, bike paths, street lights, park areas and necessary utilities and maintenance thereof has been assured by a means satisfactory to the city council. The city council shall have the option of requiring suitable guarantee in a form suitable to the city for the provision of any or all site improvements. 
(2) ?The final plan of each project area of the approved plan is in conformity with the overall approved plan. Any changes or amendments requested shall terminate approval of the preliminary plan until such changes or amendments have been reviewed and approved as in instance of the first submittal, it being the intent of this section that no other administrative or board of appeals action shall constitute official approval of such changes or amendments. Denial by the city council of any requested changes or amendments shall not void the originally approved plan.

Sec. 50-375. - Deviations from approved planned development final site plan. 
    Minor changes to a previously approved planned development site plan may be approved without necessity of planning commission or city council action thereon if the building inspector certifies in writing that the proposed revision constitutes a minor alteration and does not alter the basic design nor any specific conditions of the plan as agreed upon by the planning commission and city council. The building inspector shall record all such changes on the original PD site plan and shall advise the planning commission and city council of all said minor revisions within 15 days of said administrative approval. Minor alterations or revisions under this section shall be limited to: 
(1) ?Addition or relocation of fire escapes. 
(2) ?Shifting of building heights and elevations, providing such shifting does not exceed ten percent of the previously approved dimension and providing such shifting does not significantly alter the conceptual integrity of the plan. 
(3) ?Construction of additional, or alteration of, approved sidewalks, provided that the full intent of pedestrian movement through and around the site is not inhibited thereby.

Notes: 
(a) ?See section 50-399, 50-400 and 50-401 regarding flexibility allowances. 
(b) ?For all uses permitted other than single-family residential, the setback shall equal the height of the main building or the setback required in the district, whichever is greater. In the case of single-family dwellings, when it can be found that the front yards of two or more permitted principal structures in any block in existence at the time of adoption of this article within the district zoned and on the same side of the street are less than the minimum front yard permitted in the district, then a principal structure erected there-after shall provide the average depth of the front yards of said two or more structures. 
(c) ?In the case of a rear yard abutting a side yard, or when a side yard is adjacent to a front yard across a common separating street, the side yard abutting a street shall not be less than the minimum front yard of the district in which located (see illustration). 
(d) ?In an RM-1 multiple-family district, the total number of rooms (not including kitchen, dining and sanitary facilities) shall not be more than the area of the parcel, in square feet, divided by 2,000. All units shall have at least one living room and one bedroom, except that not more than ten percent of the units may be of an efficiency apartment type. 
a. ?In an RM-2 Multiple-Family District, the total number of rooms (not including kitchen, dining and sanitary facilities) shall not be more than the area of the parcel, in square feet, divided by 700. All units shall have at least one living room and one bedroom, except that not more than ten percent of the units may be of an efficiency apartment type. 
b. ?In both the RM-1 and RM-2 districts, for the purpose of computing the permitted number of dwelling units per acre, the following room assignments shall control: 
Efficiency = 1 room One-bedroom = 2 rooms Two-bedroom = 3 rooms Three-bedroom = 4 rooms Four-bedroom = 5 rooms  

SIDE YARDS ABUTTING A STREET [GRAPHIC] 
c. ?Plans presented showing one-, two- or three-bedroom units and including a "den," "library" or other extra room shall count such extra room as a bedroom for the purpose of computing density. 
d. ?In an RM-1 or RM-2 district, the area used for computing density shall be the total site area exclusive of any dedicated public right-of-way of either interior or bounding roads. 
(e) ?The maximum height of structures in the RM-2 Multiple-Family High-Rise District shall be subject to the review and approval of the planning commission. 
(f) ?In all RM-1, multiple-family residential low-rise, and RM-2, multiple-family residential high-rise, districts, the minimum distance between any two buildings shall be regulated according to the length and height of such buildings, and in no instance shall this distance be less than 30 feet. Parking may be permitted within a required side or rear yard but shall not cover more than 30 percent of the area of any required yard or any minimum distance between buildings. The formula regulating the required minimum distance between the two buildings in all RM-1 and RM-2 districts is as follows: 
S = (L A + L B + 2 (H A + H B ) 
___________ 
6  
Where: 
S = The required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of building A and any wall of building B or the vertical prolongation of either. 
L A = The total length of building A. The total length of building A is the length of that portion or portions of a wall or walls of building A from which, when viewed directly from above, lines drawn perpendicular to building A will intersect any wall of building B. 
L B = Total length of building B. The total length of building B is the length of that portion or portions of a wall or walls of building B from which, when viewed directly from above, lines drawn perpendicular to building B will intersect any wall of building A. 

H A = Height of building A. The height of building A at any given level is the height above natural grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the length of building A. Natural grade level shall be the mean level of the ground immediately adjoining the portion or portions of the wall or walls along the total length of the building. 
H B = Height of building B. The height of building B at any given level is the height above natural grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the length of building B. Natural grade level shall be mean level of the ground immediately adjoining the portion or portions of the wall or walls along the total length of the building (see illustration). 
(g) ?Off-street parking shall be permitted to occupy a portion of the required front yard, provided that there shall be maintained a minimum unobstructed and landscaped setback of ten feet between the nearest point of the off-street parking area, exclusive of access driveways, and the nearest right-of-way line as indicated on the major thoroughfare plan. In those instances where access drives serve as maneuvering lanes for parking spaces, such drive shall not be considered an access drive for setback purposes. 
(h) ?No side yards are required along the interior side lot lines of the district, except as otherwise specified in the single state construction code, provided that if walls of structures facing such interior side lot lines contain windows or other openings, side yards of not less than ten feet shall be provided. On a corner lot which has a rear yard abutting a residential district, there shall be provided a setback of 20 feet on the residential side street. Where a lot borders on a residential district or a street, there shall be provided a setback of not less than ten feet on the side bordering the residential district or street. 
(i) ?Loading space shall be provided in the rear yard in the ratio of at least ten square feet per front foot of building and shall be computed separately from the off-street parking requirements; except in the instance of office uses, loading space shall be provided in the ratio of five square feet per front foot of building. Where an alley exists or is provided at the rear of buildings, the rear building setback and loading requirements may be computed from the center of the alley. 
(j) ?No building shall be closer than 30 feet to any adjacent residential district. 
(k) ?Off-street parking shall be permitted in a required side yard setback except in those instances where a lot borders a residential district. 
(l) ?Off-street parking for visitors, over and above the number of spaces required under section 50-450, may be permitted within the required front yard, provided that such off-street parking is not located within 20 feet of the front lot line. 
(m) ?No building shall be located closer than 40 feet or the height of the building, whichever is the greater, to the outer perimeter (property line) of such district when such property line abuts any residential district. 
(n) ?All storage shall be in the rear yard and shall be completely screened with an obscuring wall or fence, not less than six feet high, or with a chainlink type fence and a greenbelt planting so as to obscure all view from any adjacent residential, office or business district or from a public street. 
(o) ?In residential districts R-1, R-2 and R-3, where lots are located on the St. Clair River or associated channels and canals, the property shall be treated as a through lot and have required front yards on the street and waterfront sides. Any dwelling to be constructed on the river, channel or canal frontage shall have a minimum setback on the waterfront side determined by the average setback of adjacent dwellings from the river, channel or canal. 
(p) ?In a block on one side of the street 50 percent or more occupied, the depth of the front yard need not be more than the average depth of front yards of existing buildings, and in no instance shall the front yard depth be less than 15 feet. 
(q) ?Single-family detached condominiums in a condominium subdivision shall meet all minimum requirements and standards of the district in which such dwellings are to be constructed, including minimum floor area requirements. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1400, 3-5-1996) 
Sec. 50-399. - Average lot size. 
    The intent of this section is to permit the subdivider or developer to vary his lot sizes and lot widths so as to average the minimum size of lot per unit as required in this article for each one- and two-family residential district. If this option is selected, the following conditions shall be met: 
(1) ?In meeting the average minimum lot size, the subdivision shall be so designed as not to create lots having an area or width greater than ten percent below that area or width required in the schedule of regulations and shall not create an attendant increase in the number of lots. 
(2) ?Each final plat submitted as part as part of a preliminary plat shall average the minimum required for the district in which it is located. 
(3) ?All computations showing lot area and the average resulting through this technique shall be indicated on the print of the preliminary plat. 
(4) ?Lot averaging shall not be utilized in combination with a subdivision open space plan. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1401, 3-5-1996) 
Sec. 50-400. - Subdivision open space plan. 
(a) ?The intent of the subdivision open space plan is to promote the following objectives: 
(1) ?Provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, hills and similar natural assets. 
(2) ?Encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential areas. 
(3) ?Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open area, while recognizing a reduction in development costs and allowing the developer to bypass natural obstacles on the site. 
(4) ?Encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities. 
(b) ?Modification to the standards outlined in this article may be made in the one- and two-family residential districts when the following conditions are met: 
(1) ?The lot area in all one- and two-family residential districts which are served by a public sanitary sewer system may be reduced up to 20 percent. In the R-1 district, this reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths up to ten feet. In the R-2 and R-3 districts, this reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths up to five feet. These lot area reductions shall be permitted, provided that the dwelling unit density shall be not greater than if the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum square feet lot areas as required for each one- and two-family districts under this article. All calculations shall be predicated upon the one- and two-family districts having the following gross densities (including rights-of-way):

Sec. 50-401. - Single-family clustering option. 
    The intent of this section is to permit the development of single-family residential patterns which, through design innovation, will introduce flexibility so as to provide for the sound physical handling of site plans in situations where the normal subdivision approach would otherwise be unnecessarily restrictive. To accomplish this, the following modifications to the one- and two-family residential standards shall be permitted, subject to the conditions herein imposed: 
(1) ?Under this section, the attaching of single-family homes shall be permitted when said homes are attached through a common party wall which does not have over 50 percent of its area in common with an abutting dwelling wall; by means of an architectural wall detailed which does not form interior room space; or through a common party wall in only the garage portion of adjacent structures, there being no common party wall relationship permitted through any other portion of the residential units. 
(2) ?The number of units attached in the above manner shall not exceed four. 
(3) ?Yard requirements may be modified as follows: 
a. ?No building shall be located closer to a street or service drive than 25 feet. 
b. ?Spacing between groups of attached units or individual units shall be at least 15 feet in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts. 
c. ?That side of a cluster adjacent to a service drive or private lane shall not be nearer to such drive or land than ten feet. 
(4) ?In all one- and two-family residential districts on parcels of land meeting certain criteria, densities in a cluster development may be increased to the following maximums (including street private right-of-way): 
District Dwelling Units Per Acre R-1 3.4 R-2 4.5 R-3 5.5  
(5) ?The planning commission may approve the clustering or attaching of buildings on parcels of land, under single ownership and control, which in the opinion of the planning commission have characteristics which would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size, shape or dimension or because of soil problems or similar natural condition. In approving an area for cluster development at the densities permitted in subsection (4) of this section, the planning commission shall find at least one of the following conditions to exist: 
a. ?The parcel to be developed is generally parallel to and generally does not exceed 500 feet in depth on those unsubdivided parcels of land abutting at major or collector thoroughfare of at least 86 feet of right-of-way width so as to provide transition between such major thoroughfare and adjacent single-family detached housing. 
b. ?A parcel of land located between developed single-family detached uses in which the size, shape and location of the parcel preclude a development of single-family detached units for subdivision in a proper manner; the determination shall be made by the planning commission. 
c. ?A small parcel which is shaped such that it contains acute angles which would make a normal subdivision difficult to achieve and has frontage on a major thoroughfare or collector street. 
d. ?A substantial part of the parcel's perimeter is bordered by a major or collector thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare or collector street. 
e. ?The parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil condition which results in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable. Soil test borings, floodplain maps or other documented evidence must be submitted to the planning commission in order to substantiate the parcel's qualification for cluster development. 
f. ?The parcel contains natural assets which could be preserved through the use of cluster development. Such assets may include natural stands of large trees, lands which serve as a natural habitat for wildlife, unusual topographic features or other natural assets which, in the opinion of the planning commission, should be preserved. Requests for qualification under these conditions must be supported by documented evidence which indicates that the natural assets would qualify the parcel under this option. 
(6) ?The area in open space accomplished through the use of one-family clusters shall represent at least 15 percent of the horizontal development area of a one-family cluster development. 
(7) ?In order to provide an orderly transition where the project proposed for use as a cluster development abuts a one- and two-family residential district, the planning commission shall determine that the abutting one- and two-family district is effectively buffered by means of one of the following within the cluster development; one-family lots, or detached one-family units subject to the standards of the schedule of regulations, open or recreations space, a major thoroughfare or collector street, a minimum of 40 feet greenbelt or some other similar means of providing a transition. 
(8) ?Any area to be dedicated for park, recreation or open space purposes as a result of the application of this section shall be subject to review and approval of the planning commission for minimum size, shape, location, access, the character of any improvements and assurance of the permanence of the open space and its continued maintenance. 
(9) ?In submitting a proposed layout under this section, the sponsor of the development shall include, along with the site plan, the proposed building elevations and typical floor plans, an indication of existing and proposed public easements, soil information or data sufficient to determine the buildability of the site, topography drawn at a two-foot contour interval, all computations relative to acreage and density, and any other details which will assist in reviewing the proposed plan. 
(10) ?Approval of a site plan under this section shall be effective for a period of one year. Development not started in this period shall be considered as abandoned, and authorization shall expire requiring that any proposed development thereafter shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. Any proposed change in site plan or building, after approval has been received, shall require review and approval by the planning commission prior to effecting said change. 
(11) ?Application of this option shall only be permitted when the site plan has been reviewed and approved by the planning commission. 
(12) ?Prior to taking action on a proposed one-family residential clustering option, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with section 50-546.

Sec. 50-448. - Nonconforming lots, uses of land, structures and uses of structures and premises. 
(a) ?Intent. 
(1) ?It is the intent of this article to permit legal nonconformities to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this article or future amendment. Such uses are declared by this article to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this article that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. All nonconforming uses and structures are classified as Class B nonconforming uses or structures unless designated Class A nonconforming uses or structures. 
(2) ?A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this article by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this article is derived and upon which actual construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.

(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1506, 3-5-1996) 
Sec. 50-453. - Uses not otherwise included within a specific use district. 
    Because the uses hereinafter referred to possess unique characteristics making it impractical to include them in a specific use district classification, they shall be permitted by the board of appeals in the I District, under the conditions specified and after public hearing in accordance with section 50-543. In every case, the uses hereinafter referred to shall be specifically prohibited for R-1, R-2, R-3, RM-1 or RM-2 districts. These uses require special consideration since they service an area larger that the city and require sizable land areas, creating problems of control with reference to abutting use districts. Reference to those uses falling specifically within the intent of this section is as follows: 
(1) ?Outdoor theaters. Because outdoor theaters possess the unique characteristic of being used only after darkness and since they develop a concentration of vehicular traffic in terms of ingress and egress from their parking area, they shall be permitted in the I District. Outdoor theaters shall further be subject to the following conditions: 
a. ?The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the building inspector and the city engineer as to adequacy of drainage, lighting and other technical aspects. 
b. ?Points of ingress and egress shall be available to the outdoor theater from abutting major thoroughfares and shall not be available from any residential street. 
c. ?All vehicles waiting or standing to enter the facility shall be provided off-street waiting space. No vehicle shall be permitted to wait or stand within a dedicated right-of-way. 
d. ?The area shall be laid out so as to prevent the movie screen from being viewed from residential areas or adjacent major thoroughfares. All lighting used to illuminate the area shall be installed so as to be confined within and directed onto the premises of the outdoor theater site. 
(2) ?Commercial television and radio towers and public utility microwaves and public utility television transmitting towers. Radio and television towers, public utility microwaves and public utility television transmitting towers and their attendant facilities shall be permitted in the I District, provided said use shall be located centrally on a continuous parcel of not less than one times the height of the tower measured from the base of said tower to all points of each property line. The site shall in no instance be used for the storage of vehicles or any material not required for the principal use. Outdoor storage of any kind shall be expressly prohibited. 
(3) ?Towers and antennas. Towers and antennas for cellular telephone transmission may be permitted in industrial and marina business district and on municipally owned properties subject to the following conditions: 
a. ?Cellular towers and antennas shall not exceed 150 feet in height measured from the grade at the base of the tower. 
b. ?The base of the tower shall have a minimum setback of not less than the height of the tower from any property line. 
c. ?If located on the same zoning lot with another permitted use, such tower and any other structures connected therewith shall not be located in a front yard or side yard abutting a street. 
d. ?Cellular telephone antennas and supporting structures shall be permitted to be placed on the roofs of buildings subject to the following conditions: 
1. ?The principal use is a conforming use and the building is a conforming structure. 
2. ?The antenna shall not exceed the height of its supporting structure by more than 12 feet. 
3. ?The top of the supporting structure may exceed the maximum height of the district in which it is located by not more than ten feet. 
4. ?The supporting structure shall be set back from the outermost vertical wall or parapet of the building on which it is placed a distance equal to at least two times the height of such structure. 
e. ?The planning commission may permit such use after finding that the criteria for approving special land uses are met as well as the following: 
1. ?The petitioner demonstrated that operating requirements necessitate locating within the city and within the district, and that location on existing towers or buildings in districts where such facilities are permitted are not available. 
2. ?That, in the opinion of the planning commission, nearby residential areas will not be negatively influenced by the location of the tower. 
3. ?That the height of the tower and antenna not exceed 150 feet. 
f. ?Any cellular tower and antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such tower or antenna shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned antenna or tower within said ninety days shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1507, 3-5-1996) 
Sec. 50-454. - Performance standards. 
    No use otherwise allowed shall be permitted within any district which does not conform to the following standards of use, occupancy and operation, which standards are hereby established as the minimum requirements to be maintained within such area: 
(1) ?Smoke. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to permit the emission of any smoke from any source whatever to a density greater than that density described as No. 2 on the Ringlemann Chart; provided that the following exceptions shall be permitted: 
a. ?Smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to, but not darker than, No. 3 on the Ringlemann Chart for a period or periods aggregating four minutes in any 30 minutes. 
b. ?Smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to, but not darker than No. 3 on the Ringlemann Chart for a period or periods aggregating three minutes in any 15 minutes, when building a new fire or when breakdown or equipment occurs such as to make it evident that the emission was not reasonably preventable. 
Method of measurement: for the purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringlemann Chart, as now published and used by the United States Bureau of Mines, which is hereby made a part of this chapter, shall be the standard. However, the umbrascope readings of smoke densities may be used when correlated with the Ringlemann Chart. 
(2) ?Dust, fire and fly ash. 
a. ?No person, firm or corporation shall operate or cause to be operated, maintain or cause to be maintained any process for any purpose or furnace or combination device for the burning of coal or other natural or synthetic fuels without maintaining and operating while using such process or furnace or combustion device any recognized and approved equipment, means, method, device or contrivance to reduce the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids or fumes emitted into the open air, which is operated in conjunction with such process, furnace, or combustion device so that the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids shall not exceed 0.20 grains per cubic foot of the carrying medium at a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
b. ?Methods of measurement: For the purpose of determining the adequacy of such devices, these conditions are to be conformed to when the percentage of excess air in the stack does not exceed 50 percent at full load. The foregoing requirement shall be measured by the ASME test code for dust-separating apparatus. All other forms of dust, dirt and fly ash shall be completely eliminated insofar as escape or emission into the open air is concerned. The building inspector may require such additional data as is deemed necessary to show that adequate and approved provisions for the prevention and elimination of dust, dirt and fly ash have been made. 
(3) ?Open storage. The open storage of any industrial equipment, vehicles and all materials including wastes shall be screened from public view, from a public street and from adjoining properties by an enclosure consisting of a wall not less than the height of the equipment, vehicles and all materials to be stored. Whenever such open storage is adjacent to a residential zone in either a front, side or rear lot line relationship, whether immediately abutting or across a right-of-way from such zone, there shall be provided an obscuring masonry wall or wood fence of at least six feet in height. 
(4) ?Glare and radioactive material. Glare from any process (such as or similar to arc welding or acetylene torch cutting) which emits harmful ultraviolet rays shall be performed in such a manner as not to be seen from any point beyond the property line and as not to create a public nuisance or hazard along lot lines. Radioactive materials and wastes and machine operation shall not be emitted to exceed quantities established as safe by the U.S. Bureau of Standards, when measured at the property line. 
(5) ?Fire and explosive hazards. 
a. ?In the I District, the storage, utilization or manufacture of materials or products ranging from incombustible to moderate burning, as determined by the fire marshal, is permitted, subject to compliance with all other performance standards above mentioned. 
b. ?The storage, utilization or manufacture of materials, goods or products ranging from free active burning to intense burning, as determined by the fire marshal, is permitted, subject to compliance with all other yard requirements and performance standards previously mentioned and providing that the following conditions are met: 
1. ?Such materials or products shall be stored, utilized or produced within completely enclosed buildings or structures, having incombustible exterior walls which meet the requirements of the single state construction code. 
2. ?All such buildings or structures shall be set back at least 40 feet from lot lines, or in lieu thereof, all such buildings or structures shall be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system complying with installation standards prescribed by the National Fire Association. 
3. ?The storage and handling of flammable liquids, liquefied petroleum, gases and explosives shall comply with the state rules and regulations as established by Public Act No. 207 of 1941 (MCL 29.1 et seq.). 
(6) ?Noise. Objectionable sounds, including those of an intermittent nature shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent uses. 
(7) ?Odors. Creation of offensive odors shall be prohibited. 
(8) ?Wastes. 
a. ?No waste shall be discharged into the public sewer system which is dangerous to the public health and safety. The following standards shall apply at the point wastes are discharged into the public sewer. 
b. ?Acidity or alkalinity shall be neutralized within an average pH range of between 5.5 to 7.5 as a daily average on the volumetric bases, with a temporary variation of pH 4.50 to 10.0.

Sec. 50-456. - Signs. 
    The primary function of signage, as it relates to this article, is to identify a particular use of a parcel of property. It is not the intent of this article, to have the open spaces and lines of vision created by public rights-of-way be used for unrestricted advertising through the use of signage. Signs will be allowed in such a manner as to provide those similar uses in similar zones the opportunity for identification exposure regardless of parcel size, although the location and size of buildings will influence the amount of signage permitted. This consistent approach is necessary to remove the need for the types of signs which compete for attention of the motorist, thereby creating traffic hazards as well as creating visual blight within the city. It is, therefore, within the health, safety and welfare responsibility of the city that this section is promulgated. 
(1) ?Sign definitions. The following definitions are related to signs: 
    Erect means to build, construct, attach, hang, place, suspend, affix or paint. 
    Sign means any announcement, declaration, display, billboard, illustration and insignia when designed and placed so as to attract general public attention. The term "sign" shall include any banner, bulbs or other lighting devices, streamer, pennant, inflated or deflated membrane device, propeller, flag (other than the official flag of any nation or state) and any similar device of any type or kind whether bearing lettering or not. 
1. ?Decorative display means a decorative, temporary display designed for the entertainment or cultural enrichment of the public and having no direct or indirect sales or advertising content. 
2. ?Freestanding sign means a sign, other than a ground sign or portable sign, which is not attached to a building and is capable of being moved from one location to another on the site on which it is located. 
3. ?Ground sign means a permanent display sign supported by one or more columns, uprights or braces or mounted directly in and upon the ground surface and having a height not in excess of six feet. 
4. ?Marquee sign means a sign or attached to a permanent overhanging shelter that projects from the face of the building and is supported entirely by the building. 
5. ?Portable sign means a sign and sign structure which is designed to facilitate the movement of the sign from one zoning lot to another. The sign may or may not have wheels, changeable lettering and/or hitches for towing. A sign shall be considered portable only if such sign is manifestly designed to be portable to facilitate its movement from one zoning lot to another. Signs utilized to be movable, other than from one zoning lot to another, shall be considered freestanding signs under this chapter. 
6. ?Projecting sign means a sign which is affixed to any building or structure, other than a marquee and any part of which extends beyond the building wall or structure more than 15 inches. 
7. ?Pole sign means a display sign supported by one or more columns, uprights or braces in the ground surface and having a height in excess of six feet. 
8. ?Temporary sign means a display sign, banner or other advertising device constructed of cloth, canvas, fabric, plastic or other light temporary material, inflated devices with or without a structural frame, or any other sign intended for a limited period of display, but not including decorative displays for holidays or public events. 
9. ?Wall sign means a display sign which is painted on or attached directly to the building wall. 
    Sign, accessory, means a sign which pertains to the principal use of the premises. 
    Sign alteration means the changing, enlarging or relocating of any sign, excluding the changing of movable parts of an approved sign that is designed for such changes or the repainting or reposting of original of original display matter, shall be deemed an alteration. 
    Sign, nonaccessory, means a sign which does not pertain to the principal use of the premises. 
(2) ?General requirements for all signs. The following conditions shall also apply to all signs erected or located in any use district: 
a. ?All signs shall conform to all codes and ordinances of the city and, where required, shall be approved by the building inspector and a permit issued. 
b. ?Public right-of-way. No sign, except those established and maintained by the city, county state or federal governments, shall be erected, located or placed in, project into or overhang a public right-of-way or dedicated public easement. The owner of any sign which has been removed by the city from the right-of-way because it is in violation of this provision and shall pay to the city the actual costs of removal and storage or charges as adopted by resolution of the city council, whichever is greater. If such sign is not claimed within five days, it shall be destroyed. 
c. ?Directional. All directional signs required for the purpose of orientation, when established by the city, county, state or federal government, and directional signs for churches and public service organizations shall be permitted in all use districts. 
d. ?No sign otherwise permitted shall project above or beyond the maximum height limitation of the use district in which located and provided further that no freestanding sign shall exceed three feet in height. 
e. ?No sign above a height of two feet shall be located within, project into or overhang the triangular area formed at the intersection of street right-of-way lines by a straight line drawn between the right-of-way lines at a distance along each line of 25 feet from their point of intersection. 
f. ?Accessory signs shall be permitted in any use district and may be located in the required front yard except as otherwise provided herein. 
g. ?Nonaccessory signs shall be permitted only in I district, except that nonaccessory signs pertaining to real estate development located within the city and designed to promote the sale of lots or homes within a subdivision located with the city may be permitted on a temporary basis in any use district but shall not be located upon subdivided land unless such land is part of the subdivision being advertised for sale and shall be subject to the requirements and conditions of all codes and ordinances of the city. 
h. ?Illumination of signs shall be directed or shaded downward so as not to interfere with driver visibility, become hazardous to traffic or the vision of persons on adjacent streets or property. Flashing or intermittent type signs shall not be permitted. 
i. ?Signs used for advertising land or buildings for rent, lease and/or for sale shall be permitted on the land or building intended to be rented, leased and/or sold. 
j. ?Removal of certain signs. Any sign, including framing, now or hereafter existing, which no longer advertises a bona fide business conducted or a product or entertainment, service commodity offered or sold on the lot, shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the building or structure upon which such sign shall be found within 30 days after written notice from the building inspector. Notice shall be sent to the property owner of record, as indicated in city tax rolls, by certified mail. The owner may petition the zoning board of appeals for temporary approval to install blank sign faces when it can be demonstrated that the sign structure is likely to be reused by a future business and the sign framework is in sound structural condition. 
k. ?Connections to an energy source for lighting shall be in accord with all codes of the city and shall not be exposed in any way that may constitute a safety hazard to the public. 
(3) ?Permitted signs by zoning district.

State Law reference Zoning board of appeals, MCL 125.3601 et seq. 

Sec. 50-573. - Created; membership. 
    There shall be established and appointed by the city council, in accordance with act 110 of the Public Acts of 2006, as amended, a zoning board of appeals (ZBA). Such board shall consist of seven members, one of whom shall be a member of the city council, one a citizen member of the planning commission with appointment by the council coinciding with his planning commission term, and five members who shall be appointed by the council. In the latter instance, one of such members shall be appointed for a one-year term; two of such members shall be appointed for a two-year term, and two of such members shall be appointed for a three-year term. Thereafter, each member shall be appointed to hold office for a full three-year term. No elected officer, other than the council member, or employee of the city shall be a member of the board. Any vacancy in the board shall be filled by the council for the remainder of the unexpired term. Compensation of the members of the board of appeals shall be fixed by the city council. 
(1) ?Any member who has a conflict of interest on any matter before the board of appeals may disqualify himself from voting thereon, and failure to do so may constitute misconduct in office. 
(2) ?The ZBA shall elect its own chairperson; however, a ZBA member who is also on the city council shall not be chairperson of the ZBA. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1900, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. ZOA-2015-03, § 1900, 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 50-574. - Rules of procedure. 
    The board shall annually elect its own chairman and at such other times as the board may determine by rule. The board shall adopt its own rules of procedure and shall maintain a record of its proceedings which shall be filed in the office of the city clerk and shall be a public record. The fees to be charged for appeals shall be set by resolution of the city council. In those instances wherein lot area and yard requirements in lots existing of record cannot be complied with and must therefore be reviewed by the board, the required fees for appeal, in whole or part, may be refunded to the petitioner at the discretion of the board of appeals. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1901, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. ZOA-2015-03, § 1901, 4-21-2015)

(b) ?A majority of the total membership of the zoning board of appeals shall vote on every matter (no abstentions) unless a member has a conflict of interest. A member of the ZBA shall request to be disqualified from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest. The member shall state the nature of the conflict of interest and the ZBA shall vote whether to excuse the member from participation because of a conflict of interest. Failure to raise an issue of conflict of interest prior to discussion and vote on a matter before the ZBA shall constitute misconduct in office for which the member may be removed, following a hearing. 
(c) ?Conflict of interest may include, but is not limited to: considering property a ZBA member owns or has a legal or financial interest in or adjacent property; considering a request by a party a ZBA member has close ties with, such as a relative, friend, boss, co-worker or neighbor. A fundamental issue is whether the member of ZBA believes he can objectively consider the request before the ZBA. 
(d) ?The ZBA shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, compel testimony and the production of books, papers, files, and other evidence pertinent to the matters before it, to the extent allowed by law. 
(e) ?All findings of the zoning board of appeals shall be in writing, with a record of its proceedings showing the action of the ZBA and the vote of each member of each question considered. 
(f) ?Determinations and findings of the ZBA shall be made in a reasonable time period. 
(g) ?The ZBA shall file a record of its proceedings in the office of the city clerk. The record of proceedings shall be a public record.

    Subject to the provisions of section 50-580, the board, after a public hearing, shall have the power to decide applications for appeals, interpretations, and variances filed as hereafter provided: 
(1) ?Where it is alleged by the appellant that there is an error or misinterpretation in any order, requirement, decision, grant, or refusal made by the building inspector or other administrative office in the carrying out or enforcement of the provisions of this article, then an appeal or request for ordinance interpretation shall be filed with the zoning board of appeals on forms established for that purpose. In deciding a request for ordinance interpretation, the ZBA shall ensure that its interpretation is consistent with the intent and purpose of the ordinance, the article in which the language in question is contained, and all other relevant provisions of the ordinance. 
(2) ?Where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property which existed on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of the land, building, or structure, or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the property in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this article would involve practical difficulties, provided that the board shall not grant a variance on a lot of less area than the requirements of its zoning district, even though such lot existed at the time of the adoption of this article if the owner or members of his immediate family owned adjacent land which could, without practical difficulty, be included as part of the lot. 
(3) ?Where there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter relating to the construction, structural changes in equipment, or alterations of buildings or structures, or the use of land, buildings, or structures so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done. 
(Ord. No. 96-5, § 1906, 3-5-1996; Ord. No. ZOA-2015-03, § 1906, 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 50-580. - Dimensional or non-use variances. 
    No variance in the provisions of this article shall be authorized unless the zoning board of appeals finds, from reasonable evidence, that all of the following standards have been met: 
(1) ?Such variance will not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood; 
(2) ?Such variance will not impair the intent and purpose of this article; 
(3) ?Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply to the property in question or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district. Such circumstances shall create a practical difficulty because of unique circumstances or physical conditions such as narrowness, shallowness, shape or topography of the property involved, or to the intended use of the property. See section 50-579(2); 
(4) ?Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the vicinity. The possibility of increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance; 
(5) ?The condition or situation of the specific piece of property or of the intended use of said property, for which the variance is sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situation; 
(6) ?The condition or situation of the specific piece of property or of the intended use of said property, for which the variance is sought, shall not be the result of actions of the property owner. In other words, the problem shall not be self-created; 
(7) ?That strict compliance with area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk or density would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome; 
(8) ?That the variance requested is the minimum amount necessary to overcome the inequality inherent in the particular property or mitigate the hardship; 
(9) ?That the variance will relate only to property under the control of the applicant.

Sec. 50-581. - Use variances prohibited. 
(a) ?The zoning board of appeals is hereby prohibited from granting a use variance for a use not permitted within a particular zoning district. A use variance would allow a landowner to use the land for a purpose which is otherwise not permitted or is prohibited by the applicable zoning district regulations. 
(b) ?The zoning board of appeals shall only be authorized to issue dimensional or non-use variances in strict accordance with section 50-580.

Sec. 50-583. - Standards for evaluation. 
    Each case before the zoning board of appeals shall be considered as an individual case and shall conform to the detailed application of the following standards in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of such case. All uses as listed in any district requiring board approval for a permit shall be of such location, size and character that, in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent districts. The board shall give consideration to the following:

(8) ?The nature, location, size, and site layout of the use shall be such that it will be a harmonious part of the district in which it is situated, taking into account, among other things, prevailing shopping habits, convenience of access by prospective patrons, the physical and economic relationship of one type of use to another and related characteristics. 
(9) ?The location, size, intensity and site layout of the use shall be such that its operations will not be objectionable to nearby dwellings by reason of noise, fumes or flash of lights to a greater degree than is normal with respect to the proximity of commercial to residential uses, nor interfere with an adequate supply of light and air, nor increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety.

(a) ?Where in this chapter there is delegated to the zoning board of appeals or the city planning commission the function of establishing certain physical site improvements as a contingency to securing a zoning amendment, site plan approval, special approval or variance, the zoning board of appeals or the city planning commission may, to ensure strict compliance with any regulation contained herein or required as a condition of the issuance of a permit, require the permittee to furnish a cash, performance or surety bond executed by a reputable surety company authorized to do business in the state, or irrevocable letter of credit, in an amount determined by the zoning board of appeals or the city planning commission to be reasonably necessary to ensure compliance hereunder; provided, however, that in fixing the amount of such cash, performance, surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit, the zoning board of appeals or city planning commission shall take into account the size and scope of the proposed improvement project, current prevailing cost of rehabilitating the premises upon default of the operator, estimated expenses to compel the operator to comply by court decree, and such other factors and conditions as might be relevant in determining the sum reasonable in the light of all facts and circumstances surrounding each application. 
(b) ?The performance guarantee shall be deposited with the city clerk at the time of the issuance of the permit authorizing the activity or project. The city may not require the deposit of the performance guarantee prior to the time when the city is prepared to issue the permit. 
(c) ?The city shall establish procedures whereby a rebate of any cash deposits, in reasonable proportion to the ratio of work completed on the required improvements, will be made as work progress.
