(A) Public Comment Policy: Pursuant to and in accordance with section 2.06(g) of the Illinois Open Meetings Act, the Board of Trustees will provide 2
separate opportunities for public comment at Board meetings. The first opportunity is during the "public comment - agenda items" agenda item that is
scheduled before the business portion of the Board meeting. The second opportunity for public comment is during "public comment - general items"
agenda item that is scheduled at the conclusion of the business portion of the Board meeting.
The Board has a responsibility to conduct the business of the Village in an orderly and efficient manner and to establish reasonable procedures for
public comment at its meetings. The Mayor, as Chair of the meeting (or the Chair Pro-Tem in the Mayor's absence) is responsible for ensuring the
orderly conduct of the meeting and will rule on the appropriateness of any public comment issues that may arise.
The following procedures for public comment are intended to maintain the orderly conduct of meetings and ensure fairness to those who wish to
address the Board:
(1) Anyone interested in speaking publicly at a Board meeting is welcome. Individuals are asked to sign in just prior to the start of the meeting.
(2) Speakers will be limited to 3 minutes per person during either public comment portion of the meeting. The total time allotted for the public comment
periods will be 30 minutes, unless a majority of the Board votes to extend the discussion.
(3) Any person who is not allowed to make remarks during public comment shall be permitted to submit written comment to the Board either before or
after the time for public comment with the Village Clerk.
(4) Only 1 person may speak at a time during any public comment period.
(5) No person may assign their time to any other person.
(6) The Chair may deny a person who has previously addressed the Board the opportunity to speak again during the same meeting on the same topic.
(7) No person may address the Board or engage in public comment except during 1 of the 2 defined public comment periods, when recognized by the
Chair.
(8) During any public comment period, Board members may ask questions of the speaker while he or she is speaking, if recognized by the Chair.
However, the Board need not answer questions from a speaker during any public comment period. If a person has a question for the Board, the
individual may be asked to submit the question in writing.
(9) All comments must be civil in nature. Any person who engages in threatening, slanderous, or disorderly behavior when addressing the Board, or
who speaks out of turn or otherwise disrupts the Board meeting, shall be deemed out-of-order by the Chair. Repeated or extraordinary occurrences
of disorderly conduct shall be grounds for the Chair to cause the violator to be removed from the meeting room. The Chair will rule on whether
remarks made are in violation of this policy.
(10) The Board has the authority to determine procedural matters regarding public participation not otherwise defined in this policy and not inconsistent
with this policy.
(B) Public Hearings: All public hearings required by State Statute to be held by the Board of Trustees will be conducted in accordance with State Statute.
All persons offering testimony at a hearing shall testify under oath. Public hearings are not part of the public comment period or periods of a meeting
and are not subject to the public comment policy referenced in division (A) of this section.

(Ord. 10-3-1797, passed 3-22-2010)
§ 51.125 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
(A) Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the stormwater drainage system or waters of the United
States any materials, pollutants, or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards.
The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this subchapter: water line flushing, fire hydrant flushing,
discharges from potable water sources, landscape irrigation, lawn watering, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration, uncontaminated pumped
groundwater, diverted stream flows, natural riparian habitat and wetland flows, springs, storm sewer cleaning water, street wash water from streets
where spills or leaks of pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials has not occurred (unless the pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials have been
removed), foundation drains, footing drains, crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, noncommercial vehicle washing, routing external
building washing that does not use detergents, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges (discharges must contain less than 1 part per million
chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the United States environmental protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and all other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted by the authorized enforcement agency for the discharge to the stormwater drainage system.
(B) Prohibition Of Illicit Connections: The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this subchapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage or any other nonstormwater discharge to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
(Ord. 10-3-1797, passed 3-22-2010)
§ 51.126 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
(A) Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The village of Lindenhurst may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to
a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4, or to waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States and to minimize danger to persons.
(B) Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator, in writing, of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person violates this subchapter if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval
of the authorized enforcement agency.

§ 51.128 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
(A) The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect premises subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency.
(B) Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination, copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit, and the performance of any additional duties as required
by state and federal law.
(C) The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises' stormwater discharge.
(D) The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(E) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the premises to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
(F) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to premises is a violation of this subchapter. A person who is the operator
of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation of this subchapter if the person denies
the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
subchapter.
(G) If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.

The owner, or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment, shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal stormwater drainage system or waters of the United States through the use of structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 10-3-1797, passed 3-22-2010)
§ 51.130 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that
such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 10-3-1797, passed 3-22-2010)
§ 51.131 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or any person responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information regarding any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or in pollutants entering stormwater, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps
to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person
shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person, by phone, or by facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone
shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the village of Lindenhurst within 3 business days of the phone call or personal notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least 3 years.

Chapter 99
SMOKING REGULATIONS
§ 99.01 BACKGROUND.
Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the environment of such smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that
may result from the incendiary nature of such activity. It has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and
nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide,
nitrous oxide and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68% of the total smoke produced by a cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interfering with
respiratory tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer.
Because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material and direct, on the public health, safety, welfare, comfort and property of
residents of the village, it is necessary and desirable to establish regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in all enclosed places of
employment, near entrances to all such public places, in all enclosed places of employment, in and near open air public dining areas and within certain
unenclosed public places including the village hall grounds, the Lindenhurst sanitary district sewer treatment plant site, school grounds, parks and
recreation areas and outdoor venues.

employment, within 20 feet of all public entrances to such places, in open air public dining areas and within 20 feet of such areas, and within certain
unenclosed public places including the village hall grounds, the Lindenhurst sanitary district sewer treatment plant site, school grounds, parks and
recreation areas and outdoor venues in order to ensure that nonsmokers may breathe air free from the hazardous effects of secondhand smoke.

underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment
was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be
made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any

by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such

taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is
recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department.
(B) Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for
telecommunications.

§ 119.05 RESELLERS.

department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized
by this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require.
(B) Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax free
when such actions in fact are not for resale or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales.
(C) Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.
(Ord. 02-9-1288, passed 9-23-2002)
§ 119.06 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall not
affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its application. Each
unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter.

Obscene and Harmful Material
§ 134.30 HARMFUL MATERIAL.
(A) Elements Of The Offense: A person who, with knowledge that a person is a child, that is a person under 18 years of age, or who fails to exercise
reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly distributes to or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to, or offers to distribute or
exhibit any harmful material to a child.
(B) Definitions:
DISTRIBUTE. To transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration.
HARMFUL MATERIAL. Material is harmful if, to the average person, applying contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
KNOWINGLY. As used in this section means having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable
inspection which would have disclosed the contents thereof.
MATERIAL. As used in this section means any writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment.
(C) Interpretation Of Evidence:
(1) The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the child
to whom such material was offered, distributed, sent or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 195/360
dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall
be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
(2) In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate the
material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and
can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal.
(D) Affirmative Defenses:
(1) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from circulating harmful
material to any person under 18 years of age, provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational purpose, and it shall be an
affirmative defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the act charged was committed in aid of legitimate scientific educational
purposes.
(2) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing to his child any harmful material.
(3) Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child, shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: A document issued by the federal government or any state, county or municipal government
or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the federal
selective service act or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces.
(4) In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in this section culminates in the sale or distribution of such harmful material to a child,
under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the child by the defendant, his employees or agents, as where the order or
request for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or similar means of communication, and delivery of such harmful material to
the child was by mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the
advertisement contained the following statement, or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that the defendant required the purchaser to certify
that he was not under 18 years of age and that the purchaser falsely stated that he was not under 18 years of age: "NOTICE: It is unlawful for any
person under eighteen (18) years of age to purchase the matter herein advertised."
(E) Child Falsifying Age: Any person under 18 years of age who falsely states, either orally or in writing, that he is not under the age of 18 years, or who
presents or offers to any person any evidence of age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of ordering, obtaining, viewing,
or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any harmful material, is guilty of a violation of this section.
(Ord. 84-8-559, passed 8-27-1984)

(b) Masturbation;
(c) Excretory functions; or
(d) Lewd exhibition of the genitals; and
(2) To the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient

and
(4) The material, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

architectural review committee not approve plans based on an interpretation of this Code, the Village shall have the final say and may issue the permit
without approval.
(Ord. 99-8-1146, passed 8-9-1999)
§ 150.10 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN; BUILDING PERMITS.
(A) Single-Family Residences: A building permit shall not be issued for any single-family residence which does not meet the requirements of this section.
No 2 single-family dwellings of similar front elevation or facade shall be constructed or located on adjacent lots. For the purposes of this section,
ADJACENT LOTS shall be defined as lots which adjoin or share side property lines or lots which, although separated by a street, would overlap
portions of the property lines of a lot on the other side of the street, if their respective side property lines were extended across the street to the other
side. Front elevations or facades shall be deemed to be similar when there is no substantial difference in rooflines; and no substantial change in
windows of either size, location or type; and either no change in the color of materials used (rather than a change in shade), or no substantial change in
the kind of materials.
(1) Rooflines.
(a) For the purposes of this section, the following differences in the rooflines of single-family dwellings as seen from the front of the dwelling shall be
deemed sufficient to render buildings containing the changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
1. Changing gable roofs to hip roofs.
2. Changing hip roofs to gable roofs.
3. Providing an intersecting gable roof on the main gable roof, provided that the height of the intersecting roof is at least 50% of the height of the
main roof.
4. Providing an intersecting hip roof on the main hip roof, provided that the height of the intersecting hip roof is at least 50% of the height of the
main roof.
5. Subject to review by the village engineer, a shed roof when used as a front porch roof for a minimum of 50% of the entire width of the house,
excluding area of garage.
6. Subject to review by the village engineer, a substantial difference in roofline shall be deemed to exist if the front soffit is increased significantly
and is combined with columns at least 6 inches in width or other architectural features of a similar magnitude which reach the roofline of the
highest story.
7. Rotating gable roofs 90 degrees on the building.
8. On a trilevel residence or other building type with 3 independent major roof areas, the changing of 2 out of 3 rooflines shall be acceptable as a
substantial change. Acknowledging certain design elements may prevent the changing of all 3 rooflines, it is desired that the roofs with the
greatest impact on the streetscape be changed.
(b) The following changes shall not be deemed sufficient to make adjacent structures dissimilar:
1. Gable roof atop hip roof.
2. Hip roof atop gable roof.
3. Small gable or hip projections above windows.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 200/360
4. Window dormers.
5. Change in soffit overhang or minor variation in eave height.
6. Skylight and cupola.
(2) Windows.
(a) For the purpose of this section, the following differences in the size, location or type of windows shall be deemed sufficient to render buildings
containing the changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
1. Changing from single windows to a multiple window arrangement (ganged units).
2. Changing from multiple window arrangement to single window.
3. Changing the type of windows (e.g., casement to double hung).
4. Providing a bay or bow window in the area of the predominant window.
(b) The addition or subtraction of muntin bars (dividing lights) shall not be deemed sufficient to constitute a substantial change in windows.
(c) Where, because of its size, location or design, 1 window is the predominant window on the front elevation or face, if the size, location or type of
that window is changed to render the dwelling dissimilar, then no other window need be changed.
(3) Construction Material Or Color.
(a) For the purpose of this section, the following differences in construction material between adjacent single-family dwellings as seen from the front
of the dwellings shall be deemed sufficient to render buildings containing the changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
1. 4 inch exposure horizontal siding, 8 inch exposure horizontal siding, brick facing, stone facing, or stucco/stuccato board and trim.
2. When materials are changed, the change must occur throughout the front facade or elevation for a minimum of 1 story in height.
(b) Color change shall be made by significant changes in adjacent colors. The change must be one of color rather than merely of the shade.
(B) Administration And Appeal:
(1) Administration. The provisions of this section shall be initially administered by the village engineer. The village engineer shall find single-family
dwellings to be similar or dissimilar by utilizing the general standards contained herein. The examples of similarity or dissimilarity set forth herein are
not intended to categorize all dwelling designs which may be presented to the village engineer.
(2) Appeal. In the event a building permit is denied to any applicant by reason of this section, he shall have the right to appeal to the village board,
seeking to overrule the decision of the village engineer who denied the permit. Upon the appeal being made, and after reasonable notice to the
applicant, a public hearing shall be held by the village board where evidence shall be received from the applicant and any other interested parties.
The village board within 21 days after the public hearing shall:
(a) Order the permit to be issued; or
(b) Order the permit to be issued if modifications are made in the design of the building to bring it into conformity with the provisions of this section; or
(c) Deny the petition of the applicant.
(C) Application: This section shall apply only to subdivisions approved by the village board of trustees subsequent to the passage date hereof.

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 232/360
sewer system shall have catch basins at intervals not exceeding 300 feet therewith. Manholes shall be constructed at intervals of 300 feet or less and
at all points of change in direction or grade. All storm sewer construction shall be in accordance with the current State Department of Transportation
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.
(2) Wherever subsoil conditions require it, highway drain tile shall be installed along the back of curb at a grade of not less than 3 feet 6 inches below
the top of curb adjoining same. This drain tile shall be perforated pipe and shall be of the type specified by the State of Illinois Department of
Transportation Standard Specifications. The trench shall be backfilled with pea gravel to a point 6 inches over the top of the pipe and the balance
with dirt except where the drain crosses under any pavement, then the trench shall be filled with trench backfill as defined by the Department of
Transportation Standard Specifications.
(3) All storm sewer trenches that are under street pavement, driveway pavement or alley pavement shall be backfilled with sand or pea gravel to the
underside of the pavement plane. The use of trench backfill, other than sand or pea gravel, in areas adjacent to the various pavements shall follow
the rules established by the Department of Transportation Standard Specifications.
(D) Storm water detention basins shall be provided for residential developments consisting of 5 acres or more and for commercial or industrial
developments consisting of 3 acres or more in accordance with the following minimum engineering Standards of Design, Construction, Maintenance
and Flood Control:
(1) In order to effect the intent and purposes of this Ordinance, the Village Board does hereby establish the written rules and regulations as to minimum
engineering standards governing the design, construction and maintenance of storm water detention systems including requirements as to type of
materials, methods of installation, maximum permissible rates of discharge and other engineering parameters.
(2) No building permits shall be issued in unsewered areas or separate sewered areas when construction of the facilities would result in runoff in
excess of that from its natural or undeveloped state unless the runoff rate from the area be restricted to be no greater than that from its natural or
undeveloped state and that detention space for the excess storm water be provided in accordance with the engineering requirements of this
Ordinance. Provisions shall also be made for the proper maintenance of any such detention facility.
(3) It is the intent of Division (D)(2) above to have the developers use discretion in providing detention storage area and well-maintained, landscaped
lakes would provide an aesthetic focal point in any shopping area or residential area as well as a mutually acceptable method of providing storm
water detention areas. Other methods to regulate the rate of storm water discharge which would be acceptable include detention on flat roofs,
parking lots, lawns, underground storage, etc., all with properly designed restricted outlets to the receiving storm sewer or stream.
(4) A combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff is required for all commercial developments exceeding 3 acres in area, and
for all residential developments exceeding 5 acres in area. The release rate of storm water from all developments requiring detention shall not
exceed the storm water runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state. The Village will accept the release rate of not greater than that
calculated from a storm of 5-year frequency with a runoff rate coefficient of 0.15 unless the applicant can show by his detail calculations which are
acceptable to the Village that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater. Drainage systems shall have adequate
capacity to bypass through the development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 5-year frequency assuming that the land is in fully
developed state under present zoning or zoning proposed under a comprehensive plan. The bypass flow rate shall be computed using a runoff
coefficient of not less than 0.35. An allowance will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate has previously
been approved by the Village and that evidence of its construction can be shown.
(5) The live detention storage to be provided will be calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as published by the U.S. Weather Bureau
for this area. The detention volume required will be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall for any and all durations, from the fully
developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, less that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate.
(6) One method of calculation, which will be acceptable and preferred by the Village, for the determination of the capacity of storm water detention
reservoirs is as follows:
Live Detention Storage = (Volume Runoff, 100-year) - (Release Rate x Duration)
(Inches) = V100-Qrtd=C i100td-0.15i5td
Maximum storage volume calculated by this equation for any and all duration (td) will be the required storage. The terms of the above equation are
defined as follows:
Qr = The maximum release rate in inches per hour from the land in its natural, undeveloped state.
0.15 = The coefficient of runoff for the undeveloped land.
i5 = The intensity in inches per hours of the rainfall from the U.S. Weather Bureau curve for 5-year frequency for the time of concentration of the
undeveloped land.
i100 = The intensity in inches per hour of rainfall from the U.S. Weather Bureau curve for 100-year frequency for any and all durations.
td = The duration of the 100-year storm, which must be varied to determine the most critical and therefore maximum required detention.
c = The coefficient of runoff for the completely developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir.
Note: i100 varies with td, however i5 is calculated using the longest time of concentration for the undeveloped land and becomes a constant in the
above equation.
The live detention storage, in inches of depth, can be converted to acre-feet by multiplying the inches of depth by the drainage area acres, and by
the factor 0.0833.
(E) The grades of all streets shall not be greater than 8% and all vertical curves shall be not less than 100 feet in length. The plan and profile of streets, as
well as all construction details, shall be approved by the Village Engineer before any grading operations are started.

fee schedule on file with the Village before being entitled to any approvals or permits.
(2) Reimbursement Of Village Costs. Where the nature of the application requires the Village to publish or mail legal notices or to employ the services
of planners, engineers, attorneys, or other consultants for the purposes of reviewing the application or plans in connection with it or development
pursuant to it, the applicant will be responsible for reimbursing the Village for these recoverable costs and to submit a deposit of an escrow for the

and to consent to the filing and foreclosure of a lien on the lot to insure collection of any such fees and costs, plus the costs of collection, which have
not been paid within 30 days following the mailing of a written demand for such payment to the owner at the address shown on the application. Any
lien filed pursuant to this section may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or mechanics' liens.

requirement set forth in the administrative application policy when, in the Zoning Administrator's judgment, the waiver is appropriate in light of the
nature and extent of the relief being sought or in light of special circumstances making compliance with those provisions either unnecessary or unduly
burdensome.

its recommendations for adoption of the plan as well as any reports or statements deemed necessary to a full consideration of the plan or part
thereof. The transmittal will be made not later than 15 days following the close of the public hearing concerning the plan.
(4) Action By Board Of Trustees. Upon receiving a recommendation of the Plan Commission with respect to the adoption or amendment of any plan or
a part thereof, the Board of Trustees may adopt the plan in whole or in part by ordinance duly enacted, with or without amendments; or may refer the
plan or any part thereof back to the Plan Commission for further consideration; or may reject the plan. The Board of Trustees will take action not later
than 90 days following the close of the Plan Commission public hearing on such plan. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within this time
period will be deemed to be a rejection of the plan. Upon the adoption of any plan or part thereof, it will be designated as the "Official Comprehensive
Plan of the Village of Lindenhurst" and, if less than a total Comprehensive Plan, will carry a subheading designating its specific contents.
(5) Amendment To Comprehensive Plan. The Official Comprehensive Plan, or any part thereof, may be amended at any time in accordance with the
provisions of this section. An amendment may be initiated by the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, the Zoning Administrator, or by any owner
of lots affected by the provisions of the plan sought to be amended. Amendments initiated by the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, or the
Zoning Administrator require no formal application and will be processed as otherwise provided in this section. Amendments initiated by the owner of
affected land must be initiated by an application filed pursuant to § 159-2.201 of this part.
(6) Plan Filing And Notice Of Adoption. The Zoning Administrator will cause a certified copy of the ordinance adopting the Comprehensive Plan or
amendment to be placed on file in the Office of the Village Clerk and will cause a notice evidencing the adoption of the plan, or part thereof, to be

(1) Application. Applications for a temporary use permit must be filed and in accordance with the requirements of § 159-2.201 of this part and the
administrative application policy.
(2) Village Staff Review Of Application. The Zoning Administrator will refer the application and related data to appropriate Village departments for their
study and/or comment.
(3) Zoning Administrator Decision. The Zoning Administrator will review the department's recommendations and either approve, disapprove, or approve
with conditions.
(C) General Standards: No temporary use may be granted by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to this chapter unless the applicant establishes the
following:
(1) The proposed use will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this chapter was enacted and for which the regulations of the
zoning district in question were established.
(2) The proposed use will not have a substantial or undue adverse or detrimental effect upon or endanger adjacent property, the character of the area,
or the public health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare and not substantially diminish and impair property values within the community or
neighborhood.
(3) The proposed use and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the
use and development of neighboring property according to the applicable zoning district regulations.
(4) The proposed use will be served adequately by streets, off street or on street parking, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, and other public
facilities or the applicant will provide adequately for such facilities as well as provide for safe vehicular and pedestrian access and egress to the site.
(5) The proposed use will not cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through residential streets or upon residential
property. Adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion on the public streets.
(6) The proposed temporary use will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
(7) The temporary use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable dimensional regulations of the district in which it is located. The proposed
use shall comply with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provision of this chapter.
(D) Considerations: In determining whether the applicant's evidence establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Zoning Administrator will
consider the following.
(1) Whether and to what extent the proposed temporary use at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service that is in
the interest of the public convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or community.
(2) Whether and to what extent such public benefit goals can be met by the location of the proposed temporary use at another site or in another area
that may be more appropriate than the proposed site.
(3) Whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity
through site design and screening.
(E) Conditions On Temporary Use Permit: The Zoning Administrator may impose such conditions and limitations concerning use, location, maintenance,
screening, operation, hours of operation (except as may be allowed by other Federal, State, or County requirements), and other matters relating to the
purposes and objectives of this chapter upon the premises benefited by the issuance of a temporary use permit for a temporary use as the Zoning
Administrator deems may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements near the subject
property, upon such public facilities and services, protection of the public interest, and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements
specified in this chapter. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the temporary use permit for a temporary use. Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of this chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the temporary use permit for a temporary use.
(F) Effect Of Issuance Of A Temporary Use Permit: The grant of a temporary use permit for a temporary use will not authorize the establishment or
extension of any such use as a permanent use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but
merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any other permits or approvals that may be required by the ordinances of
the Village, including, but not limited to, building permit, zoning permit, certificate of occupancy, land division approval, site plan approval, or other type
of permit or approval.
(G) Limitations On A Temporary Use:
(1) Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning Administrator, no temporary use permit for a temporary use will be valid for a period longer
than 30 days in any one calendar year.
(2) A temporary use permit for a temporary use will be deemed to authorize only the particular temporary use for which it was issued. Such temporary
use permits for a temporary use will automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall be discontinued.
(H) Amendments: A temporary use permit for a temporary use may be amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the
standards and limitations provided in this chapter for the original approval of a temporary use.

with any subsequent amendments to the temporary use permit for a temporary use.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 246/360
(b) Violations of other statutes, ordinances, or laws.
(c) A change in the character of the surrounding area or in the temporary use itself which has caused the temporary use to become incompatible with
the surrounding uses.
(2) The determination of revocation of a granted temporary use permit for a temporary use may be made by the Zoning Administrator after due notice
to the property owner, occupant, or agent as indicated on the temporary use permit for a temporary use, as to the reasons for the review.

(a) Identification of the existing uses of property within the general area of the affected property.
(b) Identification of the zoning classification of property within the general area of the affected property.
(c) Determination as to the suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted under the existing classification or district and under the

the Comprehensive Plan, and the public health, safety and general welfare.
(F) Legislative Decision: The wisdom of amending the zoning map or the text of this chapter is a matter committed to the sound legislative discretion of the
Board of Trustees.

§ 159-2.307 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 247/360
(A) Authority: The Board of Trustees has the authority to grant special use permits authorizing the development of uses listed as special uses in the
regulations applicable to the district in which the lot is located in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter and subject to the standards
set forth in this section.
(B) Purpose: It is recognized that there are uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular zoning
district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring property and of the public need for the particular
use at the particular location.
(C) Initiation Of Special Uses: Any person owning or having an interest in the property may file an application to use the property for 1 or more of the
special uses provided for in this chapter and in the zoning district in which the property is situated.

Trustees its recommendation, recommending either granting the application for a special use permit; granting the application subject to conditions; or
denying the application. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within 45 days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, will be deemed
a recommendation for the approval of the proposed special use permit.
(4) Action By Board Of Trustees. Within 60 days following the receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees will either deny the application or, by ordinance duly adopted, grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, will be
deemed to be a decision denying the special use permit. Any proposed special use that fails to receive the approval of the Plan Commission will not
be approved by the Village Board except by a 2/3 vote of all Village Board members then holding office.
(E) Standards:
(1) General Standards. No special use permit may be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the owner establishes that:
(a) The proposed use and development will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this chapter was enacted and for which
the regulations of the zoning district in question were established and with the general purpose and intent of the Village of Lindenhurst
Comprehensive Plan.
(b) The proposed use and development will not have a substantial or undue adverse or detrimental effect upon or endanger adjacent property, the
character of the area, or the public health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare and not substantially diminish and impair property values
within the community or neighborhood.
(c) The proposed use and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with
the use and development of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations.
(d) The proposed use and development will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as streets, public utilities including
public water supply system and sanitary sewer, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, public parks, libraries, schools, and other public facilities
and utilities or the applicant will provide adequately for such facilities.
(e) The proposed use and development will not cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through residential streets.
Also, adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets.
(f) The proposed use and development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant
importance.
(g) The special use will, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations
may, in each instance, be modified by the Village Board pursuant to the recommendations of the Plan Commission.
(2) Special Standards For Specified Special Uses. When the district regulations authorizing any special use in a particular district impose special
standards to be met by such use in such district, a permit for such use in such district shall not be recommended or granted unless the owner shall
establish compliance with such special standards.
(F) Findings Of Facts: Where required by statute, a special use will be accompanied by findings of facts specifying the reason or reasons for the allowance
or denial of the special use.
(G) Conditions On Special Use Permits: The Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations
concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this chapter

landscaping and screening; parking and loading areas; signage; traffic flow and access requirements; lighting; hours of operation; open-space areas;
drainage and stormwater facilities; or architectural and engineering features. These conditions will be in addition to any regulations contained in the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 248/360
(H) Permit Effective Date: The permit will become effective upon adoption of the appropriate ordinance by the Board. In the event that a special use permit
is filed in conjunction with a rezoning, the permit will not become effective until the date of enactment of the ordinance authorizing the rezoning. In the
event that some additional approval is required by some other governmental authority or agency, the permit will not become effective until that approval
is received.
(I) Time Limit Of Special Use Permits: Special use permits will be valid for an unlimited period unless a lesser period is provided in a particular permit.
Prior to the expiration of the time limit specified in a particular permit, the property owner may request that the special use permit be reviewed by the
Village Board, which may extend it for an unlimited period or for a specified additional period of years.
(J) Failure To Commence Construction Or Operation: Unless otherwise stated in the conditions of a particular special use permit, substantial construction
or operation of the special use where construction is not required must commence within 1 year of the effective date of the permit unless such time
period is extended by approval of the Village Board. If no appeal is made or no extension of time is received or granted, the permit will immediately
terminate upon expiration of the 1 year period.
(K) Revocation: In any case where a special use has not been established within 1 year after the date of granting thereof, then without further action by the
Plan Commission or the Village Board, the special use authorization will be null and void.
(L) Discontinuance Of Use: A special use permit will automatically expire and cease to be effective if the use is discontinued for a period of 6 consecutive
months or more.
(M) Transferability: All special use permits are approved for the specific lot or parcel of land, and may not be transferred to any other location. An approved
special use permit is transferable to any subsequent land owner unless otherwise specified at the time of the approval of the special use permit.
(N) Procedure To Amend Approved Special Use Permit: Any expansion, increase in extent of operation, or other changes made to a special use beyond
that which was designated on the original special use permit application and/or authorized by ordinance by the Village Board, will be considered an
amendment to the special use permit. In order to amend an existing special use permit, the application procedures, required materials, and approval
process are the same as for a new permit.
(O) Effect Of Denial Of A Special Use: No application for a special use which has been denied wholly or in part by the Village Board may be resubmitted
for a period of 30 days from the date of the order of denial.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-2.308 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
(A) Authority: The Board of Trustees has the authority to approve the development of planned unit developments, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this chapter and subject to the standards set forth in this section.
(B) Purpose: The planned unit development is intended to allow the relaxation of otherwise applicable substantive requirements based on procedural
protections providing for detailed review of individual proposals for significant developments. This special regulatory technique is included in this
chapter in recognition of the fact that traditional bulk, space, and yard regulations that may be useful in protecting the character of substantially
developed and stable areas may impose inappropriate pre-regulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of lots or areas that lend
themselves to an individual, planned approach.
(C) Parties Entitled To Seek Planned Unit Development Approval: An application for a special use permit to permit a planned unit development may be
filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject lot.
(D) Concept Plan: Prior to the official submittal of the required detailed preliminary plan pursuant to division (E) of this section, the applicant may, at its
option, submit a concept plan to the Village Board and/or the Plan Commission to discuss the scope and the proposed nature of the contemplated
development, and receive informal and nonbinding feedback on the proposed concept.
(E) Preliminary Plan:
(1) Procedure.
(a) Application. Applications for preliminary plan approval must be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 159-2.201 of this part and the
administrative application policy. The application must show all buildings and their use, open space, common open space, recreation facilities,
service areas, and other facilities to indicate the character of the proposed development.
(b) Public Hearing. A public hearing will be set, noticed, and conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with §§ 159-2.202 and 159-2.203 of
this part.
(c) Plan Commission Review And Recommendation. Within 60 days after the public hearing and review of the preliminary planned unit development
plan and supporting data for conformity to these regulations, the Plan Commission will recommend approval, approval with modification, or
disapproval, and the reasons for its recommendation, or indicate why a report cannot be rendered to the Village Board.
(d) Transmittal Of Plan Commission Recommendation To Village Board. The Plan Commission will send its recommendation including the reasons
for its recommendation to the Village Board. The recommendation will set forth with particularity in what respects the proposal would or would not
be in the public interest including, but not limited to, findings of fact on the following:
1. In what respects the proposed plan is or is not consistent with the stated purpose of the planned unit development regulations.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 249/360
2. The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and standards of the planned unit development regulations.
3. The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including, but not limited to, the density, dimension, area, bulk, and use, and the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in
the public interest.
(e) Village Board Decision. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, the Village Board, without further public hearing, may
approve or deny the preliminary plan.
(2) Standards.
(a) No special use permit for a planned unit development may be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the owner shall establish
that the proposed development will meet each of the standards made applicable to special use permits pursuant to § 159-2.307 of this part.
(b) Preliminary plans must meet the site plan application requirements specified in § 159-2.312 of this part.
(c) Where the planned unit development involves the division of land, planned unit development preliminary plans must meet all of the tentative plat
subdivision requirements set forth in the Village subdivision ordinance.
(d) A planned unit development shall be in general conformance with or shall carry out the general objectives of the adopted Village of Lindenhurst
Comprehensive Plan.
(e) No planned unit development will be recommended or granted unless the owner establishes that the proposed development will meet each of the
following criteria:
1. The extent to which the proposed use will be served adequately by, or will provide for, essential public facilities and services such as highways,
streets, parking spaces, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools.
2. The adequacy of the public infrastructure to support the proposed use at the proposed location. In considering this use criteria, the Plan
Commission shall consider not only the proposed uses, but other proposed rezonings and the zoning of vacant properties in order to determine
both the individual and cumulative impacts.
3. The extent of the community need for the proposed use at the proposed location in light of existing and proposed uses of a similar nature in the
area, and the need to provide or maintain a proper mix of uses within the Village and within the immediate area of the proposed use. The Plan
Commission shall not approve any planned unit development unless it is able to find that the proposed use in the proposed location will not
result in either an overconcentration of a particular use within the Village or within the immediate area of the proposed use.
4. The extent to which the proposed use at the proposed location will, or may, have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property,
the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, utility facilities, and other matters affecting the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
5. The extent to which the proposed use and its design and landscaping will enhance and protect the existing character of neighboring land uses, if
any, or enhance the community character of the Village.
6. The extent to which the proposed use will be served by, or will provide, proper pedestrian and public transportation linkages both within the
immediate area of the development and with other parts of the Village or County.
7. The extent to which the proposed use will be served by, or will provide, adequate public and private open space both in the immediate vicinity of
the proposed use and throughout the Village. The Plan Commission will, in considering this criteria, consider the adequacy of such open spaces
both in terms of site design and buffering and in terms of the open space needs of the permanent or transient population likely to be generated
by the proposed use.
(3) Effect Of Preliminary Plan Approval. Approval of a preliminary plan will not constitute approval of the final plan. Rather it will be deemed an
expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the preparation of the final plan which will be submitted for
approval of the Village and subsequent recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and conditions of the preliminary
approval, if any.
(4) Limitation On Preliminary Plan Approval. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning Administrator, unless a final plan covering at least
the area designated in the preliminary plan as the first stage or unit of the planned unit development has been filed within 2 years from the date the
Board of Trustees grants preliminary plan approval, or in any case where the owner fails to file the final plan and to proceed with development in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the preliminary plan approval will automatically expire and be rendered void and the Zoning
Administrator will, without further direction, initiate an appropriate action to formally revoke the special permit for all portions of the planned unit
development area that have not yet been completed.
(5) Simultaneous Submission Of A Final Plan. The owner may, at his or her option, submit a final plan for the proposed planned unit development
pursuant to the requirements of division (F) of this section simultaneously with the submission of the preliminary plan. In such case, the owner must
comply with all provisions of this chapter applicable to submission of the preliminary plan and to submission of the final plan. The Plan Commission
and the Board of Trustees will consider such plans simultaneously, applying the standards for both preliminary and final plans, and shall grant or
deny final plan approval in accordance with the provisions of division (F) of this section.
(F) Final Plan:
(1) Procedure.
(a) Application. Applications for final plan approval must be filed and in accordance with the requirements of § 159-2.201 of this part and the
administrative application policy. The application will also include the following information:
1. The final plan for a planned unit development will serve as the final plat of subdivision, in the case of a planned unit development resulting in the
division of land, suitable for recording with the Lake County Recorder of Deeds. The purpose of the final plan of a planned unit development
resulting in the division of land is to designate with particularity the land subdivided into conventional lots as well as the division of other lands
into common open areas and building areas.

2. All common open spaces must be either conveyed to a public agency or to a not for profit corporation or entity established for the purpose of
benefiting the owners and residents of the planned unit development or retained by the developer with legally binding guarantees (in a form
approved by the Village Attorney) that the common open space will be permanently preserved as open area. All land conveyed to a not for profit
corporation or like entity must be subject to the right of the corporation to impose a legally enforceable lien for maintenance and improvement of
the common open space. Membership in the corporation is mandatory for each land owner and successive buyer having a right of the use,
enjoyment, or benefit of the open space or its facilities. All such covenants and restrictions governing common open space must be recorded in
the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Lake County prior to the sale of any property within the planned unit development.
3. All covenants and restrictions governing deed restricted open space must be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Lake County
prior to the recording of the final plan and the sale of any property within the planned unit development.
4. All improvements and public facilities made necessary as a result of the planned unit development must be completely installed prior to the
approval of the final plan. In lieu of this, the developer may submit to the Village Engineer an estimated cost of required improvements and the
developer may post a performance guarantee, in a form acceptable to the Village Attorney and approved by the Village Board, which assures
the provisions and requirements within the time limits of this section. The installation and approval of the required improvements or submittal of
the performance guarantee are necessary prerequisites to approval of the final plan.
5. A performance and maintenance guarantee must be provided in accordance with the Village subdivision ordinance.
6. All final agreements, provisions, declarations, or covenants which will govern the use, maintenance, and continued protection of the planned unit
development are subject to the review of the Village Attorney and will be recorded agreements running with the land in the Office of the Lake
County Recorder of Deeds.
(b) Submission. The final plan may be submitted to the Village in phases, or stages, with each phase reflecting the applicable portion of the approved
preliminary plan, but not later than 2 years following said preliminary plan approval. If submitted in phases, or stages, each portion of the planned
unit development shall conform to the previously approved preliminary plan and all requirements of these regulations.
(c) Public Meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with §§ 159-2.202 and 159-2.203 of
this part.
(d) Review By Plan Commission. Within 60 days following the filing of an application for approval of a final plan, the Plan Commission will review and
act on the plan.
1. Approval Based On Substantial Conformity. If the Plan Commission finds substantial conformity between the final plan and the approved
preliminary plan and further finds the final plan to be in all other respects complete and in compliance with any and all conditions imposed by
approval of the preliminary plan and with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable Federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances,
and regulations, it will transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees with its recommendation, that the Board of Trustees approve the final plan, with
or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the owner as a condition of approval.
2. Recommendation Of Denial. If the Plan Commission finds that the final plan is not in substantial conformity with the approved preliminary plan
and does not merit approval, or if the Plan Commission requires modifications of a final plan that are not accepted by the owner, the Plan
Commission will transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees together with its recommendation that the final plan not be approved.
3. Failure To Act. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, shall be deemed to
be a recommendation to the Board of Trustees to deny the final plan as submitted.
(e) Action By Board Of Trustees. Within 60 days following the receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees will either:
1. Approval Based On Substantial Conformity. If the Plan Commission has recommended approval of a final plan based on substantial conformity
with the preliminary plan, the Board of Trustees may, unless it specifically rejects 1 or more of the findings of the Plan Commission on the basis
of expressly stated reasons, approve the final plan by a duly adopted ordinance.
2. Referral Back To Plan Commission. The Board of Trustees may refer the final plan back to the Plan Commission for further consideration of
specified matters.
3. Denial. The Board of Trustees may deny final plan approval if it finds, whether pursuant to a recommendation of the Plan Commission or not,
that the final plan is not in substantial conformity with the approved preliminary plan and does not merit approval or would only merit approval
subject to modifications or conditions that are not accepted by the owner.
4. Failure To Act. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, will be deemed to
be a decision denying final plan approval.
(2) Compliance With Subdivision Ordinance Final Plat Requirements. Where the planned unit development involves the division of land, planned unit
development final plans must meet all of the final plat for subdivision requirements set forth in the Village subdivision ordinance.
(G) Conditions On Planned Unit Development Approvals: The approval of a planned unit development may be conditioned on such matters as the
approving body may find necessary to prevent or minimize any possible adverse effects of the proposed planned unit development, or to ensure its
compatibility with surrounding uses and development and its consistency with the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this chapter, the Village's
subdivision ordinance, and the Official Comprehensive Plan; provided, however, that no such condition of final plan approval shall impair the rights
granted by preliminary plan approval. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the approval in question. Violation of any
such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for the planned unit
development.
(H) Authority To Vary Regulations: The planned unit development may depart from strict conformance with the required density, dimension, area, bulk, use,
and other regulations for the standard zoning districts and other provisions of this chapter to the extent specified in the preliminary land use and zoning
plat and documents authorizing the planned unit development so long as the planned unit development will not be detrimental to or endanger the public
health, safety, or general welfare.

(I) Final Plan Scheduling Deadlines And Termination: The Village Board may revoke the planned unit development if construction falls more than 2 years
behind the schedule filed with the approved planned unit development final plan. Extensions in the building schedule may be granted by the Village
Board.
(J) Recordation Of The Final Plan: The ordinance approving the final plan shall be effective only upon recording of the final plan and supporting data with
the County Recorder of Deeds. The recording of the final plan shall inform all who deal with the planned unit development of the restrictions placed
upon the land and act as a zoning control device.
(K) Building Permits: No building permits shall issue and no construction may occur until the final plan has been approved and recorded with the County
Recorder of Deeds.
(L) Impact Fees: See § 150.07 of this title for applicable impact fee regulations.
(M) Changes And Amendments To An Approved Planned Unit Development: Planned unit developments will be developed in accordance with the
approved final plan and all supporting data or, in the case of a planned unit development involving the division of land, the recorded final plan and all
supporting data. The approved final plan and all supporting data (in the case of a planned unit development involving the division of land, the recorded
final plan and supporting data) together with all amendments will be binding on the applicants, their successors, and assigns and will limit and control
the use of premises and location of structures in the planned unit development project as set forth therein.
(1) Minor Changes And Amendments. The Village Board upon recommendation of the Plan Commission, at its discretion, may approve minor changes
in the final plan of the planned unit development. A planned unit development final plan submitted to amend an approved final plan will conform
substantially to the preliminary plan approved.
(2) Major Changes And Amendments. In the event the planned unit development final plan submitted to amend an approved final plan does not
conform substantially to the approved preliminary plan, or in the event the applicant desires to amend a planned unit development previously
approved as a preliminary plan, the changes therein or amendments thereto may be approved only by following the procedure of filing an amended
preliminary plan or final plan (whichever is applicable) as provided in this chapter. Such changes or amendments approved in a recorded final plan of
a planned unit development shall be recorded as amendments to such final plan or by the filing of a new "corrected" final plan in the Office of the
Lake County Recorder of Deeds.
The Village Board, upon recommendation of the Plan Commission, may find that any modification therein, including modifications in location, design,
and number of buildings; roadways; and utilities will be considered major if such modification:
(a) Changes the concept or intent of the preliminary plan;
(b) Increases the gross residential density or intensity of use by more than 5%;
(c) Decreases the total area set aside for common open space or deed restricted open space;
(d) Changes by more than 10% in the floor area for a nonresidential use; or
(e) Increases by more than 5% the total ground area covered by buildings or structures.
(3) No Waiver Of Covenants Or Agreements. No changes in the approved final plan waive any of the covenants or agreements limiting the use of land,
buildings, structures, and improvements within the planned unit development unless specifically approved to the contrary by the Village Board.
(N) Existing Planned Unit Development Districts: Any planned unit development district approved prior to the effective date of this chapter (February 27,
2017) will be subject to the provisions of division 159-9.102(C) of this chapter.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-2.309 ZONING VARIATION.
(A) Authority: The Board of Trustees has the authority to grant variations from the provisions of this chapter in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this chapter and subject to the standards set forth in this section.
(B) Purpose: The variation procedure is intended to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen particular
applications of this chapter that create practical difficulties or particular hardships. If the difficulties or hardships are more appropriate for remedy under
any other provision of this chapter, the variation procedure is inappropriate.
(C) Parties Entitled To Seek Variations: Applications for variations may be filed by the owner of, or person having a contractual interest in, the lot.
(D) Procedure:
(1) Application. Applications for variations must be filed and in accordance with the requirements of § 159-2.201 of this part and the administrative
application policy.
(2) Public Hearing. A public hearing will be set, noticed, and conducted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with §§ 159-2.202 and 159-
2.203 of this part.
(3) Action By Zoning Board Of Appeals. Within 35 days following the close of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals will render its decision
recommending the granting or denying of the variation. The failure of the Board of Appeals to act within 35 days, or such further time to which the
owner may agree, will be deemed to be a decision recommending denial of the variation.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 252/360
(4) Recommendations Of Denial. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has recommended that a variation be denied, it may not be granted except by
the favorable vote of 2/3 of all the Trustees then holding office.
(E) Standards: No variation may be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the owner has established that carrying out the strict letter of
the provisions of this chapter would create a particular hardship or a practical difficulty.
(F) Findings Of Fact: Upon review of the application and information presented at the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals will consider the
following criteria which are consistent with the rules provided to govern determinations of the Zoning Board of Appeals as referenced by State Statute.
(1) No variation may be granted that is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the district in which the development is located.
(2) There must be evidence that the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances. There must be exceptional, extraordinary, or unusual
circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use, or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the
same district and the granting of the variation would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed.
(3) There must be evidence that the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by
the regulations of the district.
(4) The variation must be necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district
and same vicinity.
(5) There must be evidence that the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. No variation may be granted that will create
substantial detriment to adjacent property and will materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest.
(G) No Powers To Change Zoning Or Grant Use Variations: Nothing in this chapter may be construed to give or grant to the Zoning Board of Appeals the
power or authority to alter or change this chapter or any zoning district made a part of the Village zoning map, such power and authority being reserved
to the Village Board, nor may the Zoning Board of Appeals grant use variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals does not have any power or authority
with respect to any alterations or change in this chapter except to make recommendations to the Village Board in specific cases as may properly come
before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(H) Variation Less Than Requested: A variation less than or different from that requested may be granted when the record supports the owner's right to
some relief but not to the relief requested.
(I) Conditions On Variations: The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the Board of Trustees may impose such specific conditions and
limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this
chapter upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other lots and
improvements in the vicinity of the subject lot or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions will be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting
the variation. Violation of any condition or limitation will be a violation of this chapter and will constitute grounds for revocation of the variation.
(J) Effect Of Grant Of Variation: The grant of a variation will not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any
permits and approval that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, building permits.
(K) Expiration Of Variation: No variation permitting a use of a building or property will be valid for a period longer than 18 months, unless such use is
established within such period provided, however, where such use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such order shall
continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection or alteration is started and
proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-2.310 ZONING INTERPRETATION.
(A) Authority: Subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations of this section, the Zoning Administrator may render interpretations, including use
interpretations, of the provisions of this chapter and of any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it.
(B) Purpose: The interpretation authority established by this section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this chapter, though detailed and
lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many situations, however, can be readily addressed by
an interpretation of the specific provisions of this chapter in light of the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted.
Because the interpretation authority is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the essential content of
this chapter but rather is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
(C) Parties Entitled To Seek Interpretations: Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having an interest in the circumstances giving rise
to the need for an interpretation; provided, however, that interpretations may not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical facts or where
the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
(D) Procedure:
(1) Application. Applications for interpretations of this chapter must be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 159-2.201 of this part and the
administrative application policy.
(2) Action On Application. Within 30 days following the receipt of a properly completed application, the Zoning Administrator will inform the applicant in
writing of his or her interpretation, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis on which the determination is based.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 253/360
(3) Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Zoning Administrator may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided in § 159-2.311
of this part.
(E) Standards: The following standards govern both the Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals from the Zoning Administrator
in issuing use interpretations.
(1) Any use expressly defined in this chapter will be interpreted as defined.
(2) No use interpretation may permit a use listed as a permitted use or a special use in any district to be established in any district in which the use is
not so listed.
(3) No use interpretation may permit any use in any district unless evidence is presented that demonstrates that it will comply with each use limitation
established for that particular district.
(4) No use interpretation may permit any use in a particular district unless the use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in the district and is
more similar to those uses than to uses permitted or specially permitted in a more restrictive district.
(5) If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a special use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use
interpretation permitting the use must be conditioned upon the issuance of a special use permit.
(6) No use interpretation may permit the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with the district intent statement of the district in question.
(7) Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, in rendering use interpretations, the Zoning Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals shall be
guided by the SIC or NAICS use classification system and methodology.
(F) Effect Of Favorable Use Interpretations: No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district
authorizes the establishment of the use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but merely
authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of
the Village including, but not limited to, zoning permit, special use permit, building permit, or any other required permit.
(G) Time Limitation: Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning Administrator, no use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
specially permitted in a particular district will be valid for a period longer than 6 months from the date of issue unless a building permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
(H) Applicability: A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district will be deemed to refer only to the
particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to refer to any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation
has not been issued. The permit will automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued is, for any
reason, discontinued for a period of 6 consecutive months or more.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-2.311 APPEALS TO ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS.
(A) Authority: The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to hear and decide appeals from, and review orders, decisions, determinations, or the failure to
act, of the Zoning Administrator acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under this chapter and to that end the Zoning Board of Appeals has
the same powers and is subject to the same standards and limitations as the Zoning Administrator with respect to any order, decision, or determination
being appealed.
(B) Purpose: The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary, ill-considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It is intended to
avoid the need for resort to legal action by establishing local procedures to review and correct administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as a
means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this chapter or the rightful authority of the Zoning Administrator to enforce the
requirements of this chapter. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied in the language of
this chapter and to the reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with the administration of this chapter.
(C) Parties Entitled To Appeal: An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be filed by any person aggrieved or adversely affected by an
order, decision, determination, or failure to act of the Zoning Administrator acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under this chapter.
(D) Procedure:
(1) Application. An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals must be filed not later than 45 days following the action being appealed and in
accordance with the requirements of § 159-2.201 of this part and the administrative application policy.
(2) Referral By Zoning Administrator. Upon receipt of a properly completed application for an appeal, the Zoning Administrator will transmit to the
Zoning Board of Appeals the application together with all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(3) Public Hearing. A public hearing will be set, noticed, and conducted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with §§ 159-2.202 and 159-
2.203 of this part.
(4) Action By Zoning Board Of Appeals. Within 30 days following the close of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals will render a decision on
the appeal. The decision may reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole or in part, the action appealed from and may include such order or determination
as, in the opinion of the Zoning Board of Appeals, is proper to be made in the premises. The failure of the Zoning Board of Appeals to act within 30
days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, will be deemed to be a decision denying the appeal.
(5) Written Decision. The Zoning Board of Appeals' decision must be transmitted in writing to the applicant, and include findings of fact specifying the
reasons for the decision.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 254/360
(E) Stay Of Proceedings: An application for an appeal properly filed will stay all proceedings in the furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Zoning
Administrator's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings will not be stayed.
(F) Conditions And Limitations On Rights Granted By Appeal: In any case where this chapter imposes conditions and limitations upon any right, any such
right granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeal will be subject to such conditions and limitations in the same manner and to the same extent
as if secured without the necessity of an appeal.
(G) Review Under Administrative Review Law: All final administrative decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals are subject to judicial review pursuant to
the provisions of the State of Illinois Administrative Review Law, and all amendments and modifications thereof, and the rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)

Village Board on the site, natural resource features and plans, site intensity of use, building location, density of dwelling units, floor area, impervious
surface area, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring uses, potential impacts upon neighboring uses, utilization of open
space, landscaping plans, lighting plans, off street parking and loading areas, driveway locations, loading and unloading in the case of commercial
and industrial uses, highway access, traffic generation and circulation, the proposed operation, and emergency vehicle accessibility, as well as any
other requirements of the Zoning Administrator or other governmental agencies. All engineering-related issues, including site grading, will be
reviewed and subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
(2) Single-family detached and 2-family detached dwellings (and their accessory structures) are exempt from all requirements of this section except

(D) Process: The Plan Commission may not recommend to the Village Board any approval for any site plan or other required plans unless it finds after
viewing the site plan review application and data that the structure or use, as planned, will not violate the intent and purpose of this chapter. The Plan
Commission may recommend and the Village Board may approve the plans only after determining the proposed building or buildings will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire, or traffic congestion, or otherwise endanger the public
health or safety and provided such proposed development meets the various intent and purpose statements set forth in this chapter.
(E) Standards: The following standards apply to site plan review:

construed to be the boundary of the district.
(C) When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right-of-way or with a lot line, the district boundary will be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map.

district as the property immediately abutting such alleys, streets, public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-way. Where the centerline of a street, alley,
public way, waterway, or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, will be
deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.

Note:
1. "P" is a permitted use and "S" is a special use.
(B) Detailed Standards For Special Uses In Residential Districts: In addition to the general standards for special use permits as set forth in § 159-2.307 of
this chapter, the following detailed standards must be met for the specified use.
(1) Multiple-Family Attached Dwelling Units With More Than 2 Dwelling Units Per Structure In The R-3 District. The following special standards must be
considered in granting a special use permit for a multiple family development of more than 2 units in the R-3 District.
(a) The extent to which the proposed use will be served adequately by, or will provide for, essential public facilities and services such as highways,
streets, parking spaces, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools. Adequate provision must
be made to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. Unless approved by the Village Board
based upon recommendation from the Plan Commission, no private streets shall be permitted in an R-3 Multiple-Family Dwelling District. A traffic
study prepared by a traffic safety engineer may be required as determined by the Plan Commission with the approval of the Village Board.
(b) The adequacy of the public infrastructure to support the proposed use at the proposed location. In considering this use standard, the Plan
Commission shall consider not only the proposed uses, but other existing and proposed zoning and the zoning of vacant properties in order to
determine both the individual and cumulative impacts.
(c) The extent to which the proposed use at the proposed location will, or may, have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property,
the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, utility facilities, and other matters affecting the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
(d) The extent to which the proposed use and its design and landscaping will enhance and protect the existing character of neighboring land uses, if
any, or enhance the community character of the Village.
(e) The extent to which the proposed use will be served by, or will provide, proper pedestrian and public transportation linkages both within the
immediate area of the development and with other parts of the Village or County.
(f) The extent to which the proposed use will be served by, or will provide, adequate public and private open space both in the immediate vicinity of
the proposed use and throughout the Village. The Plan Commission shall, in considering this criteria, consider the adequacy of such open spaces
both in terms of site design and buffering and in terms of the open space needs of the permanent or transient population likely to be generated by
the proposed use. Common open space consisting of land unoccupied by nonrecreational structures, buildings, streets, rights-of-way, minimum
required lot areas, and automobile parking lots and designed and intended for the use of enjoyment of residents of an R-3 Multiple-Family Dwelling
District shall be provided in each R-3 Multiple-Family Dwelling District. Common open space may contain structures for recreational use.
(g) Environmental elements relating to soil erosion, preservation of trees, protection of watercourses, lakes, wetlands, and other resources; noise;
topography; and animal life shall be reviewed and the site, landscape, and building design shall minimize any adverse impact on these elements.
(h) The proposed use shall not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural or historic feature of significant importance.
(i) The use shall not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking,
utilities, facilities, and other matters affecting the public health, safety, and general welfare and shall be constructed, arranged, and operated so as
not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the development and use of neighboring property or properties.
(j) The proposed use shall provide on site amenities and services which are consistent with the nature and intensity of the proposed use and the
availability of amenities and services in the immediate area of the site.
(k) The proposed use will provide adequate landscaping and buffering, and all signage and lighting will comply with this Code.
(2) Senior Housing, Age Restricted. The following specific standards must be considered in granting a special use permit for a senior housing, age
restricted single family development.
(a) The otherwise applicable bulk standards set forth in division 159-4.104(A) of this part may be modified as part of the special use permit approval
for a senior housing, age restricted development, subject to the following limitations:
1. The minimum lot area may not be reduced below 6,000 square feet in area.
2. The minimum lot width may not be reduced below 50 feet, measured at the setback line.
3. The required front yard may not be reduced below 20 feet.
4. The required rear yard may not be reduced below 25 feet.
5. The required side yard may not be reduced below 6 feet.
6. The required corner side yard may not be reduced below 20 feet.
7. The maximum lot coverage may not exceed 50%.
8. The maximum building height may not exceed 30 feet.
9. The gross density may not exceed 4.0, and the net density may not exceed 6.
(b) Any special use permit approval for a senior housing, age restricted development shall be conditioned upon the recordation of a declaration of
covenants, conditions and restrictions that restricts the occupancy of the residential housing in accordance with applicable Federal laws.
(3) Stables, Private. The following specific standards must be considered in granting a special use permit for a private stable.
(a) The minimum lot area must be 2.0 acres. This minimum lot area will be increased by 40,000 square feet for each equine in addition to 2.
(b) On parcels of land less than 200,000 square feet, all feed and bedding shall be stored indoors. On parcels of land 200,000 square feet or more,
piles of feed or bedding shall be located 75 feet from any public street right-of-way or lot line of an adjacent nonresidential district and 100 feet
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 265/360
from any lot line of an adjacent residential district lot line, in order to minimize odor and nuisance problems.
(c) Pasture area may extend to the lot line.
(d) Manure piles must be stored, removed, and/or applied in accordance with applicable Village requirements.
(e) All points on the perimeter of any stable building or corral must be at least 50 feet from the nearest boundary line or right-of-way line of the parcel

(B) Detailed Standards For Special Uses In Nonresidential Districts: In addition to the general special use standards required by division 159-2.307(E) of
this chapter, the following special standards apply to the identified special uses.
(1) Amusement Parks. The following standards apply to all permanent amusement parks.
(a) All amusement parks must be located contiguous to an arterial or collector street.
(b) A landscaped buffer yard intensity factor of 5 (see § 159-7.700 of this chapter) must be provided along all property lines of the entire amusement
park, and the amusement park shall be enclosed with a masonry wall of at least 8 feet or more in height so as to discourage entrance from areas
other than the designated entrances to said facilities; or enclosed by an earthen berm of at least 8 feet in height or higher and a chainlink fence,
fully screened from view by vegetation so as to discourage entrance from areas other than the designated entrances to said facilities.
(c) If the property abuts a residential zoning district, then a buffer yard with a minimum width of 100 feet comprised of an earthen berm equal to the
height of the top of the roofs must be constructed with a slope of no greater than 2:1 and landscaping installed to provide 100% canopy cover over
said buffer yard area. The minimum buffer yard intensity level factor shall be 5. (See § 159-7.700 of this chapter.)
(d) All off street parking areas and access ways must be adequately illuminated. Cutoff lighting shall be required. The total cutoff of light must be at
an angle of less than 90 degrees and must be located so that the bare light bulb, lamp, or light source is completely shielded from the direct view

of an observer 5 feet above the ground at the point where the cutoff angle intersects the ground and so that no light can be viewed from the
residential districts.
(e) Loudspeaker and announcement systems must be so located with respect to the zoning district boundaries so that the level of sound, as
measured in decibels, as measured at the property line shall not exceed 40 dB during the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. or 35 dB during the time
period from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

(a) All activities, including animal exercise areas, must be conducted within an enclosed building which allows for adequate ventilation.
(b) Buildings housing animal hospitals and veterinary clinics which are fully enclosed, must be located no closer than 75 feet from any adjacent
residential zoning district.
(c) Enclosed exercise areas shall be not less than 150 feet from any residential lot line. The operator of the animal hospital or veterinary clinic is

Lakes and ponds 100% Yes 100% Yes
Streams 100% No 100% No
(B) Natural Resources To Remain Undisturbed And In Natural State: All the natural resources required to be protected under this section must remain
undisturbed and in a natural state except those natural resources where mitigation is permitted and where that mitigation is in strict accord with those
requirements set forth in § 159-7.203 of this part. The clearing or removal of trees within a woodland or forest area is development and subject to these
natural resource protection standards. All removal and clearing development must comply with these natural resource protection standards. Any
proposed changes to woodland and forest resources are a change of use and require the issuance of a zoning permit in order to assure that required
protection levels are met under the standards set forth under this chapter.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-7.202 NATURAL RESOURCE FEATURES DETERMINATION.
(A) Woodlands And Forests: The definition of woodlands and forests (mature and young), as applied to this part, appears in § 159-9.200 of this chapter.
The determination of woodland and forest boundaries will be based on the following sources:
(1) A field survey of trees compiled by a registered land surveyor and identified by a landscape architect, forester, arborist, or botanist with a
professional degree in 1 of those fields of endeavor; and
(2) The most recent 1 inch equals 100 feet, 1 inch equals 200 feet, 1 inch equals 400 feet aerial photographs prepared by the Northeastern Illinois
Planning Commission (NIPC) or Lake County.
The area of woodlands and forests (mature and young), in square feet or acres, must be measured and graphically delineated on the "natural
resource protection plan". The woodland and forest area drawing will indicate all woodland and forest areas of the property. The location, size, and
species of all healthy trees having a diameter of 6 inches or greater dbh that are located in woodland and forest areas within 25 feet of any proposed
improvement and/or in woodland and forest areas to be demolished due to the placement of improvements or grading are to be graphically shown on
the "natural resource protection plan" or submitted as a separate drawing. For the remaining undisturbed areas of the development, subdivision, or
condominium only the outline of woodland and forest areas indicating whether they are mature or young woodlands is required.
(B) Lakes And Ponds: Lakes and ponds are to be determined through the use of the definitions of "lake" and "pond" as set forth in § 159-9.200,
"Definitions", of this chapter and the sources in the order indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by
the Village, the succeeding source will be used.
(1) Topographic survey prepared by and certified by an Illinois registered land surveyor at a contour interval of not less than 2 feet.
(2) USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps.
The area of lakes and ponds (in square feet or acres) will be measured and graphically delineated on the "natural resource protection plan".
(C) Streams: Streams, as defined in § 159-9.200 of this chapter, are to be determined through the use of the definitions of "channel" and "stream" and the
sources in the order indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the Village, the succeeding source
will be used.
(1) Topographic survey prepared by and certified by an Illinois registered land surveyor at a contour interval of not less than 2 feet.
(2) USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps.
The area of streams (in square feet and acres) will be measured and graphically delineated on the "natural resource protection plan".
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-7.203 NATURAL RESOURCE FEATURES MITIGATION.
(A) Intent Of Mitigation: The Village recognizes that, under certain circumstances, property owners or subdividers may wish to develop in portions of those
protected natural resource features areas that are shown as eligible for mitigation as indicated in division 159-7.201(A), table 159-7.201 of this part. In
division (B) of this section, the conditions for mitigation and mitigation standards are set forth for the various natural resource features for which
mitigation is allowed. The intent of this section is not to permit greater destruction of natural resource features than is permitted under the requirements
of this chapter for typical property or development. This section sets specific standards for use when the extent of the natural resources on a site and
the use of the regulations would create a major hardship for required natural resource feature protection. Thus, mitigation is intended to be used in lieu
of a variance request when severe hardships would result from the strict enforcement of the natural resource protection standards and requirements
set forth in this chapter.
(B) Mitigation Standards: The following methods, requirements, standards and/or criteria shall be followed for the mitigation of those natural resource
features that may be mitigated under the requirements set forth under division 159-7.201(A), table 159-7.201 of this part.
(1) Woodlands And Forests. The following applies to woodland and forest areas:
(a) Mitigation must include the planting of 1.25 acres of new woodland/forest for every 1 acre, or portion thereof, of disturbed woodland/forest for
which mitigation is required.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 293/360
(b) Mitigation must include the replacement of woodlands/forests that have been disturbed. Mitigation must consist of the planting of new
woodland/forest areas, as specified in division (B)(1)(a) of this section, using all of the following numbers of plants per acre of mitigated area.
15 canopy trees, minimum 3.5 inch caliper
25 canopy trees, minimum 2.5 inch caliper1
250 canopy trees, minimum 5 foot high whips
50 understory trees, minimum 5 foot high whips
30 shrubs, minimum 12 inches high
Note:
1. 3.5 inch caliper canopy trees may be substituted with two 2.5 inch caliper canopy trees.
(c) The species of plants to be used in the mitigation of woodlands/forests must be similar to those that are destroyed as follows:
1. In mitigation areas where there are soils located conducive to the planting of species native to northern Illinois xeric forests, a minimum mix of
12 species are to be planted. Acceptable species for northern Illinois xeric forest woodland and forest mitigation are as indicated in table 159-
7.203 of this division. No more than 80% of the total number of trees planted for mitigation purposes, however, may be of the white oak, red oak,
or black oak (Quercus alba, Quercus borealis, or Quercus veluntina) species.

2. In mitigation areas where there are soils located which are not conducive to the planting of species native to northern Illinois xeric forests,
alternative native plant species must be planted which are tolerant of the soil types in which the plants are to be placed.
(d) The land on which the mitigation is to take place must be protected with a deed restriction and conservation easement as a permanent natural
resource features conservation easement.
(e) No tree cutting or removal, subsequent to the adoption of this chapter, may reduce the woodland/forest natural resource features protection
requirements of this chapter.
(2) Lakes And Ponds. Lakes and ponds may be mitigated as may be permitted under the requirements of this chapter subject to conformance with the
Lake County watershed development ordinance.
(C) Off Site Mitigation: Off site mitigation may be permitted by the Village Board provided that such off site mitigation occurs within the same subwatershed
as the natural resource feature, or property, being mitigated and follows the methods, requirements, standards, and/or criteria set forth under division
(B) of this section.

§ 159-7.700 LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
§ 159-7.701 APPLICABILITY.
(A) Landscaping Required: Landscaping is required in peripheral buffer yards, street buffer yards, for on lot landscaping, in off street parking areas, and in
areas where vegetative mitigation is required. The area and length of each, as required herein, must be measured in order to determine the amount of
landscaping required.
(B) Exemptions And Modifications: All developments must meet the provisions of this section except as specifically exempted below.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 304/360
(1) Residential development on existing lots of record in the E, SE, S, R-1, R-2, and R-3 Districts as of the effective date of this chapter (February 27,
2017).
(2) Additions to existing buildings (principal and/or accessory) where the total floor area is not increased more than 10% of the existing total floor area.
(3) Additions to buildings (principal and/or accessory) that increase their overall building area from 10% to 50% must conform to the landscaping
standards specified in this § 159-7.700 to the maximum extent possible. All off street parking areas and buffer yards must conform to the landscaping
requirements of this § 159-7.700. If insufficient dimensions exist on site, in order to achieve a sufficient level of landscaping, the standards set forth in
this section may be reduced by up to 30% by the Village.
(4) Areas located within floodplains, floodways, flood lands, and wetlands are exempt from the landscaping requirements set forth in this § 159-7.700.
(C) Buffer Yards To Ameliorate Nuisances Between Certain Adjacent Zoning Districts: A buffer yard is a combination of a setback and a visual buffer or
barrier, and is a yard or area together with the planting and/or landscape structure required thereon. The amount of land, the type of planting, and the
amount of planting specified for each buffer yard requirement of this chapter are designed to ameliorate nuisances between certain adjacent zoning
districts. Buffer yards are also designed to ensure a desired character along public streets and roads.
(D) Buffer Yards Required To Separate Different Zoning Districts: Buffer yards will be required to separate different zoning districts from each other. Buffer
yards function to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas, or to
provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions.
(E) Special Landscaping, Streetscape, And Buffer Yards For R-4 District:
(1) Landscaping must be integrated into building arrangements, topography, off street parking, and buffer yard requirements on lots in the R-4 District.
Landscaping must include trees, bushes, shrubs, ground cover, perennials, annuals, plant sculpture, area, and the use of building and paving
materials in an imaginative manner.
(2) Buffer yards must be located around the perimeter of the site to minimize the offsite impacts of headlight glare, noise, light from structures and open
areas and the movement of people and vehicles. Buffer yards may consist of fencing, evergreens, shrubs, bushes, deciduous trees, or combinations
thereof to achieve the intent of the R-4 District.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-7.702 STANDARD PLANT UNITS.
All landscaping requirements are stated in terms of the number of standard plant units required. This § 159-7.700 defines the standard plant unit and its
alternatives. All required landscaping must conform to 1 or more of the plant unit alternatives of this section. Table 159-7.702 of this section specifies the
plant unit alternatives. In general, the 5 alternative plant mixes are interchangeable. In other cases, where a year round screen is required, Alternative Unit
A is preferred and may even be specified by the Plan Commission.

§ 159-7.703 CREDIT FOR EXISTING PLANT MATERIALS.
Credit for existing plant material will be allowed to offset required plant unit landscaping in the buffer yards and parking lots as follows:
(A) Buffer Yards: Where there are existing trees having a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 4 inches or larger, the number of such trees per 100 feet will
be credited towards the landscaping as plant units by dividing such trees by 3. Where the buffer yard is to be left in a natural state, no shrubs will be
required. Individual trees 6 feet in height or more will be counted on an individual basis towards the planting requirements; other components of a plant
unit are required including all shrubs.
(B) Parking Lots: Any existing trees 6 feet in height or more will be subtracted from the required area amount of parking lot landscaping on a tree by tree
basis.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-7.704 GENERAL LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
(A) Physical Containment Of Landscaped Areas: All landscaped areas located within or adjacent to a parking area, or adjacent to a public street or
sidewalk, must be designed to contain landscape materials and to prevent vehicular encroachment (i.e., through the use of continuous concrete
curbing, railroad ties, header, or depressed construction).
(B) Artificial Landscape Materials: Artificial trees, shrubs, turf, or plants are permitted as landscaping.
(C) Ground Cover: The use of landscape fabrics under all areas landscaped with nonliving materials, except those areas set aside for stormwater
retention/detention, is recommended to prevent weed growth. Mulch must be provided to all trees planted in parkways. Mulch must be to a depth of 3
inches to 4 inches.
(D) Irrigation: A permanent, on site, outdoor water supply (underground or drip irrigation, hose bibs, etc.) that provides complete coverage to all new living
landscaped areas may be required. Watering systems must be designed to water landscaped areas efficiently and avoid irrigation of adjacent parking
areas and access drives, sidewalks, buildings, and public streets. If hose bibs are used, they must be located within 100 feet of any landscaped area.
(E) Location: New vegetation must be selected, planted, and maintained so that at maturity it will not interfere with utility lines, snow storage areas,
vehicular parking, pedestrian circulation, traffic sight visibility at driveways and street intersections, and will not cause damage or upheaval of sidewalks
and pavement.
(F) Type Of Landscape Plant Materials: The Village encourages the use of native plant materials, trees, shrubs, and ground cover, indigenous to
northeastern Illinois. In shore buffer areas, these include native plants which are tolerant of both moisture and hydric soils.
(G) Installation:
(1) Landscaping and watering devices may be required to be installed in accordance with the approved landscape plan prior to issuance of a certificate
of occupancy or commencement of operations. The Village will have the right to refuse approval of any project not meeting the provisions of this
section.
(2) If approved landscaping and watering devices cannot be installed prior to occupancy or commencement of operations, a certificate of occupancy
may be issued by the Village if the applicant provides an acceptable form of surety. The application must be accompanied by a complete estimate of
the total cost of the approved landscaping and watering system improvements prepared by a landscape architect. All landscape materials must be
guaranteed for 2 years.
(3) When it is determined that the landscaping and watering system have been installed in accordance with the approved plans, the Village will return
the surety to the applicant.
(H) Maintenance:
(1) Responsibility For Maintenance.
(a) Maintenance of all landscaping is the responsibility of the owner, lessee, heirs, assigns, agents, homeowners' association, or other liable entity of
the property and must consist of regular watering, pruning, mowing, fertilizing, the replacement of irrigation systems, and architectural features.
(b) The owner or liable entity in control of any private premises must at all times maintain the premises free of litter and weeds.
(2) Future Building Pads. Future building pads within a phased development must be maintained in a dust free condition vegetated with ground cover.
(3) Plant Replacement. Any plant materials included in an approved landscaping plan that do not survive a plant establishment period of 2 years after
installation must be replaced with plant materials of the same or like species of equal size within the next planting season, but in any event, within 6
months of the plant's demise. Replacement must be made by the property owner or, in the case of landscape plant materials located within a
landscape easement under the control of a homeowners' association, the homeowners' association will be responsible for replacement.

§ 159-7.705 GENERAL BUFFER YARD REQUIREMENTS.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 306/360
(A) General:
(1) Buffer yard standards are listed in this section for peripheral buffer yards and for street buffer yards.
(2) Peripheral and street buffer yard standards are based on a required relative buffer yard intensity value. A variety of combinations of buffer yard
width, planting intensity, and structural options (i.e., fences and earthen berms) may be selected from § 159-7.709, table 159-7.709 of this part to
reach the required buffer yard intensity value.
(3) Peripheral buffer yards must be located along the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, and must extend to the lot or parcel boundary line. Peripheral
buffer yards may not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or right-of-way.
(4) Required buffer yard plantings may be planted in natural appearing groupings along the total length of the buffer yard and need not be spaced
uniformly along the total buffer yard length.
(B) Plant Materials:
(1) For each buffer yard listed, a specific combination of deciduous canopy, shade, and understory trees; evergreen trees; and shrubs is required as
indicated in § 159-7.702 of this part.
(2) All buffer yard areas must be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless vegetation is already fully established.
(C) Height Of Required Vegetation: Height of vegetation selected for required buffer yards will be measured from the highest finished adjacent grade of the
element to be screened.
(D) Berming: Earthen berms must be designed to transition to existing grades, not to exceed a slope ratio of 2:1, and must be covered with plant material,
ground cover, or partially riprapped to prevent erosion. Berms with vegetative cover must be designed to retain irrigation water rather than encourage
runoff. All earthen berms must be safely designed in order to accommodate mowing when needed.
(E) Calculation Of Buffer Yard Requirements:
(1) Buffer yard requirements are calculated using the standards listed in this § 159-7.700 for peripheral buffer yards and for street buffer yards as
specified in § 159-7.707, table 159-7.707 of this part.
(2) Buffer yard standards listed in this § 159-7.700 are to be calculated for every 100 linear feet of peripheral lot line boundary and/or street frontage
present on a given lot.
(3) In instances where the zoning district boundary and/or street frontage is less than 100 feet, the required buffer yard planting is 1 plant unit (see
§ 159-7.702, table 159-7.702 of this part).
(4) To determine the type of buffer yard required on a parcel, between 2 parcels or lots, or between a parcel or lot and a street, the following
procedures will be used.
(a) Procedures For Determining Minimum Required Peripheral Buffer Yards.
1. Identify whether any portion or property line of the parcel or lot coincides with a zoning district boundary. If it does, determine the abutting zoning
districts on both sides of the property line.
2. Refer to § 159-7.707, table 159-7.707 of this part to determine the required buffer yard intensity factor needed to be achieved between the 2
zoning districts.
3. Based upon the buffer yard intensity factor required, refer to § 159-7.707, table 159-7.707 of this part to select the minimum number of plant
materials (per 100 feet of buffer yard length), the buffer yard width, and required structure type combination by selecting the desired alternative
buffer yard type.
4. Calculate the actual number of plants required by selecting the minimum number of plant materials (per 100 feet of buffer yard length) from the
alternatives indicated in § 159-7.709, table 159-7.709 of this part and multiply by the hundreds of feet of buffer yard to be planted.
5. Review §§ 159-7.703 and 159-7.704 of this part for responsibility for installation of peripheral buffer yards.
(b) Street Buffer Yards.
1. Refer to § 159-7.708, table 159-7.708 of this part to determine the required buffer yard intensity factor.
2. Follow the calculation and procedures outlined in division (E)(4)(a) of this section.

nonresidential areas as set forth in this chapter may not always lead to good design and, under some circumstances, may be difficult to achieve. This
section addresses landscape mitigation measures which may be allowed by the Village.
(A) Mitigation Of Required Buffer Yards And Off Street Parking Landscaping Permitted: The mitigation of the dimensional requirements, structural
requirements, and/or landscape plant unit and/or material requirements of required peripheral or street buffer yards is allowed. Landscape surface ratio
(LSR) mitigation are only allowed for required on site landscaping as required in table 159-7.714 of this section.

landscape surface ratio (LSR) through mitigation measures may not fall below those landscape surface ratios (LSRs) set forth in table 159-7.714 of this
section. In no case may reductions in landscape surface ratios (LSRs) supersede the natural resource protection standards set forth in this chapter or
allow for increases in either the maximum gross floor area ratio (GFAR) or net floor area ratio (NFAR) set forth in the various zoning district
requirements of this chapter.

Part 8. Nonconformities
§ 159-8.100 NONCONFORMITIES.
§ 159-8.101 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 317/360
(A) Purposes: This part regulates and limits the continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established prior to the effective date of this chapter that
do not conform to the regulations of this chapter applicable in the zoning districts in which such uses, structures, and lots are located.
The zoning districts established by this chapter are designed to guide the future use of land within the Village by encouraging the development or
maintenance of desirable residential, commercial, office, and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to
promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the
purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
(B) General Scope And Scheme Of Regulation: Separate restrictions are established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of
structures designed for a permitted use (§ 159-8.102 of this part), nonconforming uses of structures not designed for a permitted use (§ 159-8.103 of
this part), nonconforming structures (§ 159-8.103 of this part), and nonconforming lots of record (§ 159-8.104 of this part). The degree of restriction
made applicable to each category of nonconformity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of
investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type. Pursuant to § 159-2.309 of this chapter, provision is made for relief from some of the
restrictions of this part when practical difficulties or a particular hardship exist.
In the cases of nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses in structures designed for a permitted use, the degree of incompatibility is
frequently great, the investment is comparatively small, and the economic life is short. In these cases, elimination of the nonconformity is required after
a relatively short, but reasonable, amortization period. In the case of nonconforming uses in structures not designed for any conforming use, the degree
of incompatibility is also frequently great, but so too is the investment and economic life of the structure. In these cases, while eventual elimination is
required, a more extended period is allowed in which to amortize the investment. While the regulations of this part related to all other nonconformities
allow such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time, they restrict further investments that would make more permanent their
location in inappropriate districts.
(C) Exception For Repairs Pursuant To Public Order: Nothing in this part will be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a
structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe
and orders its restoration to a safe condition, provided such restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this part prohibiting the
repair or restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures.
(D) Nonconforming Accessory Uses And Structures: No use or structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure may continue after
the principal use or structure has been terminated, unless it thereafter conforms to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-8.102 NONCONFORMING USES.
(A) Authority To Continue: Except as provided in division (H) of this section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in divisions (B) through (G) of this section and in division 159-8.101(D) of this part.
(B) Ordinary Repair And Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of non-bearing walls, nonbearing
partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any structure containing a nonconforming use.
(C) No Structural Alteration: No structural alteration may be made in a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use, except in the following
situations:
(1) When the alteration is required by law.
(2) When the alteration will actually result in elimination of the nonconforming use.
(3) When a building is in a residential zoning district containing residential nonconforming uses, the building may be altered in any way to improve
livability, provided no structural alterations are made which would increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
(D) Extension Of Use: A nonconforming use may not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Prohibited activity includes, without being
limited to:
(1) An extension of the use, including its accessory uses, to any structure or land area other than that occupied by the nonconforming use on the
effective date of this chapter or any amendment that causes the use to become nonconforming; and
(2) An extension of the use, including its accessory uses, within a building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by
such nonconforming use on the effective date of this chapter or any amendment that causes the use to become nonconforming; and
(3) An extension of the hours of operation of the use beyond the normal hours of operation on the effective date of this chapter or any amendment
hereto that causes the use to become nonconforming.
(E) Moving: No structure containing a nonconforming use may be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof thereafter conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located
after being moved. No nonconforming use of land may be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or
any other lot, unless the use thereafter conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
(F) Change In Use: A nonconforming use may not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in which the use or structure is
located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it may not be changed back to any nonpermitted use. For purposes of this
division, a use will be deemed to have been changed when an existing nonconforming use has been terminated and a permitted use has commenced
and continued for a period of 5 days. Any change of use in violation of this division will be deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing
nonconforming use.

(G) Damage Or Destruction:
(1) When any structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the control of the owner to the extent of not more than 50% of the cost of
replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of the structure may be made and the nonconforming use may continue subject to the
regulations of this section. However, no repairs or restorations may be made that would create any new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity
or increase the degree of any parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to the damage or destruction, nor may any repairs or
restoration be made except in conformity with the applicable zoning district regulations unless restoration is actually begun within 1 year after the
date of the partial damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
(2) When any structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50% of the cost of replacement of the structure new or
where a structure is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the owner, the structure may not be restored unless the use of the
structure thereafter conforms to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and unless the restoration is accomplished without
creating any new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increasing the degree of any parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing
prior to the damage or destruction.
(H) Termination By Abandonment: When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 6 consecutive months, regardless of any intent
to resume or not to abandon the use, the use may not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land or
structure must comply with the use regulations of the zoning district in which the land or structure is located.
Any period of discontinuance caused by government action, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, will not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this paragraph.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-8.103 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
(A) Authority To Continue: Any nonconforming structure that is devoted to a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in this part.
(B) Repair, Maintenance, Alterations, And Enlargement: Any nonconforming structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged; provided,
however, that no repair, maintenance, alteration, or enlargement may either create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing
nonconformity of all or any part of the structure.
(C) Moving: No nonconforming structure may be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless the entire structure thereafter conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
(D) Damage Or Destruction:
(1) Not Within The Control Of The Owner. Any nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the
owner, to any extent, may be repaired, restored, or replaced; provided, however, that no repair, restoration, or replacement may be made that would
create any new nonconformity not existing prior to such damage or destruction nor shall any repair, restoration, or replacement except in conformity
with the applicable district regulations be made unless the repair, restoration, or replacement is actually begun within 1 year after the date of such
damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
(2) Within The Control Of The Owner. In no event may any damage or destruction to a nonconforming structure by means within the control of the
owner be repaired, restored, or replaced except in accordance with division (B) of this section; provided, however, that a nonconforming structure
that is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the owner may be repaired, restored, or replaced in the following circumstances:
(a) If damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50% or less of the gross floor area of the structure, the repair, restoration, or replacement may not create
any new nonconformity not existing prior to the damage or destruction; or
(b) If damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 50% of the gross floor area of the structure, the nonconforming structure may only be
repaired, restored, or replaced in conformity with all applicable district regulations except for lot area.
(Ord. 17-2-2065, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 159-8.104 LEGAL NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
(A) Definition: A LEGAL NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD is a lot that:
(1) Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been a lot of record owned separately or individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the
creation of a lot of such size, depth, and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning or other ordinance or regulation; and
(2) Has remained in separate or individual ownership from such adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time since such lot became
nonconforming by reason of this chapter or any predecessor zoning or other ordinance or regulation. For purposes of this section, a lot shall not be
deemed to have been owned separately or individually unless the owner of such lot did not, directly or indirectly, have legal title to or a beneficial
interest in the adjoining tracts of land at any relevant time.
(B) Authority To Use: In any zoning district, a legal nonconforming lot of record may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is located, as
follows:
(1) Residential Substandard Lots. A lot located in a residential district that does not contain sufficient area to conform to the dimensional requirements
of this chapter, but is at least 50 feet wide and 6,000 square feet in area, may be used as a single building site provided that:
(a) The use is permitted in the zoning district.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 319/360
(b) The lot is a lot of record in the Lake County Recorder of Deeds Office prior to the effective date of this chapter (February 27, 2017).
(2) Nonresidential Substandard Lots. A lot located in a nonresidential zoning district that does not contain sufficient area to conform to the dimensional
requirements of this chapter may be used as a building site provided that the lot is a lot of record in the Lake County Recorder of Deeds Office prior
to the effective date of this chapter (February 27, 2017).
(3) Setback And Yard Requirements. Substandard lots granted permits under this chapter are required to meet the setback and other yard
requirements of this chapter. A building permit for the improvement of a lot with lesser dimensions and requisites than those stated in division (A) of
this section will be issued only after a variance is granted.
(C) Contiguous Nonconforming Lots: Where 2 or more lots of record or combination of lots and portions of lots of record with continuous frontage are
developed as a single zoning lot under single ownership or unified control, are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and
where all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot widths and area, the lots involved shall be considered to be a single zoning
lot for the purpose of this chapter. No portion of the zoning lot shall be used or sold which would diminish compliance with the lot width and area
requirements established by this chapter for the district in which the lots are located, and no building permit shall be issued for development on any
such nonconforming lot.

CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE RIGHTS OF WAY
§ 161.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
(A) Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's jurisdiction,
which will provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village rights of way and the
village as a whole.
(B) Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of the public
ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
(1) Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places;
(2) Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
(3) Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or public property;
(4) Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of utility facilities;
(5) Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
(6) Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed;
(7) Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 339/360
(8) Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights of way; and
(9) Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.
(C) Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within the
jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated
by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
(D) Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license
or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village rights of way. Utilities
that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the
village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this chapter.
(E) Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
(1) Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
(2) Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
(F) Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent
of such conflict.
(G) Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this chapter,
the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
(H) Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

subcontractors shall comply with this section.
(B) Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary
policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=686 345/360
(B) Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to
the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
shall, at a minimum:
(1) Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;
(2) Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and

good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village engineer or director of public works, and may
also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village engineer or director of public works may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The
amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
division for any single phase.
(D) Withdrawals: The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this
division, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day

(E) Replenishment: Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this section.
(F) Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in division (C) of this section.
(G) Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the
security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
(H) Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights
which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
