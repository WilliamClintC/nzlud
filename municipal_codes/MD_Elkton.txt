approved are incorporated into any permit issued, all development shall occur strictly in
accordance with such approved plans and applications.
IV-2

in the performance of his/her duties.
Section 2. Severability

of the Zoning Ordinance shall be construed to exempt any applicant for a permit from compliance
with all local, state, and federal codes, statutes, and regulations.
2. Prior Permits. No building permit which was lawfully issued prior to the original effective date of
this Ordinance and which is in full force and effect at said date shall be invalidated by the passage

good cause shown, extend a permit without additional charge for an additional period not exceeding six
(6) months.
Section 5. Permit Application Requirements and Procedures
1. All applications for permits shall be accompanied by such plans and information as the Town of
Elkton deems to be necessary to determine compliance and provide for enforcement of this
IV-3
Zoning Ordinance. The application materials listed in Appendix A shall be the minimum.
Additional information may be required.
2. Site Plans Required:
a. Minor Site Plan. A minor site plan shall be filed for a single-family dwelling, a duplex, a
residence with an accessory apartment, any accessory building, an addition or change of a
commercial or industrial structure, or for a special exception use which does not require a
building permit. Minor site plans shall be approved by the Planning Commission. Minor
site plans shall expire within six (6) months if no building permit is obtained.
Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator, in those above cases where a field
inspection indicates that the scope of the proposed building, addition, accessory use, or
special exception is of such a nature that the provisions for the handling of natural and
stormwater, sediment control, off-street parking, set-backs, water and sewerage, and
other requirements cannot be adequately addressed with a minor site plan, a major site
plan shall be required.
b. Major Site Plan. All applications for building permits, other than those accompanied by a
minor site plan, or those that are considered minor or major subdivisions (see
definitions), shall be accompanied by a major site plan. Major site plans shall be
approved by the Planning Commission. Major site plans shall expire within six (6)
months if no building permit is obtained.
c. General Development Plan.
(1) A general development plan is a site plan by which, at the early stages of
development design, the Planning Commission may consider, approve, or restrict
major aspects of the development without requiring an undue amount of final
design work on the part of the developer. The general development plan is less
detailed and specific than a major site plan in terms of exact arrangement of
buildings, parking areas, open spaces, access points, and any other site design
features. No building permits can be issued based upon a general development
plan.
(2) General development plans shall be required as follows:
(a) All applications for zoning map amendments shall be accompanied by a
general development plan.
(b) General development plans shall be required to permit more than one
principal structure and its accessory structures on a lot or parcel of land.

IV-4
g. Transportation Plan
(1) No building or part of a building shall be permitted to be erected within the lines
of highway or street shown on the Town's Transportation Plan Map.
(2) The owner of the property so affected, however, shall have the right to appeal the
refusal of a building permit to the Board of Zoning Appeals, and the Board may
grant a permit to build if it should find, upon the evidence and arguments
presented to it upon such appeal:
(a) That the entire property of the appellant of which the area affected by the
Transportation Plan forms a part, cannot yield a reasonable return to the
owner unless such appeal be granted; and
(b) That balancing the interest of the general public in preserving the
integrity of the plan and the interest of the owner of the property in the
use and benefits of his property, the granting of such permit is required
consideration of reasonable justice and equity.
(3) Before taking any action, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public
hearing at which time the parties in interest shall have an opportunity to be heard.
In the event the Board grants a building permit in any such appeal, it shall have
the power to specify the exact location, extent, area, height, duration, and other
details and conditions to govern the building, structure, or part thereof for which
the permit is granted.
h. Stormwater Management Plan. A permit may not be issued for any parcel or lot unless a
stormwater management plan meeting all the requirements of the Stormwater
Management Ordinance has been approved.
i. Forest Conservation. Projects that ultimately require approval of subdivision, sediment
control, site plan approval or grading permits must comply with the requirements of the
Forest Conservation Ordinance (Article XVIII, Part III)
3. The following additional requirements shall be applicable to site plans required under this
section:
a. Compliance with applicable established design criteria, construction standards, and
specifications for all improvements as may be required by the Planning Commission and
this Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may require that the proposed
development comply with some or all of the applicable design requirements contained in
the Elkton Subdivision Regulations.
b. The building permit shall not be issued unless and until the Maryland Department of
Transportation has approved the site plan as it relates to access point design details and
parking lot circulation layout on a state highway.
c. Other Approvals. If this Zoning Ordinance requires approval by another agency of certain
site plan features, such approval shall be obtained prior to issuance of a building permit.
IV-5
d. Any or all of the information required for a minor or major site plan may be waived if the
Zoning Administrator finds that it is not needed to make a determination of zoning
compliance.
e. The basic information required with building permit applications is shown in Appendix
A.
f. Posting and Notification of Adjacent Property Owners. Compliance with the
requirements as set forth in Article IV, Section 1.2.b(4) and 1.2.b(5) of the Elkton
Subdivision Regulations shall be required for all site plan applications.
Section 6. Certificate of Occupancy
Certificate of Occupancy Required. No person shall use or permit the use of any structure or premises or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, enlarged or moved, wholly or partly, until a
certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the Building Inspector. Such certificates shall show
that the structure or use, or both, or the premises, or the affected part thereof, are in conformity with the
provisions of the International Building Code or International Residential Code, as amended.
Section 7. Inspection And Supervision During Installation
1. Unless specifically provided in this ordinance, the construction standards for all off-site
improvements and on-site improvements required by this article shall conform to the Town
design and construction standards. Appropriate Town authorities shall approve the plans and
specifications for all required improvements and shall inspect the construction of such
improvements to assure conformity thereto.
2. Inspection during the installation of the off-site improvements shall be made by the department
responsible for such improvements as required to certify compliance with the approved site plan
and applicable standards.
3. The owner shall notify the appropriate Town agencies in writing three (3) days prior to the
beginning of all street, water, sewer, or storm sewer work shown to be constructed on.
4. The owner shall provide adequate supervision on the site during the installation of all required
improvements and have a responsible superintendent or foreman together with one (1) set of
approved plans, profiles, and specifications available at all times when work is being performed.
5. Upon satisfactory completion of the required improvements and after having received verification
by the appropriate Town approving authorities, the Director of Building and Zoning shall
recommend to the Town Administrator the release of any bond which may have been furnished
for the guarantee of satisfactory installation of such improvements of parts thereof. This release
shall provide for ten (10) percent of the total bond to be retained for a period of 12 months after
completion of all work. Bond retention period may be extended for an additional 12 months if
major failures or deficiencies occur as determined by the Zoning Administrator. Said retainer
shall be for the protection of the Town to cover failures, discrepancies, etc., in the previously
approved improvements.
IV-6
6. The installation of improvements as required in this article shall in no case serve to bind the
Town to accept such improvement for the maintenance, repair, or operation thereof.
Section 8. As-Built Site Plan
Upon satisfactory completion of required improvements as shown on the approved site plan or a section
thereof, the developer shall submit to the Director of Building and Zoning four (4) copies of the "as built"
site plan, certified by the engineer before occupancy of any building, for the review and approval for
conformity with the approved site plan by the appropriate Town departments (as designated in this
section). The Director of Building and Zoning shall not process the occupancy permit until the
appropriate "as built" site plan has been reviewed and approved by the appropriate agencies. As-built site
plan should indicate any deviations from site improvements shown on final approved site plan.
Section 9. No Occupancy, Use, or Sale of Lots Until Requirements Fulfilled
Issuance of a special exception or zoning permit authorizes the recipient to commence the activity
resulting in a change in use of the land or (subject to obtaining a building permit) to commence work
designed to construct, erect, move, or substantially alter buildings or other substantial structures or to
make necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except as provided in Sections 14 and 15 of
this Part, the intended use may not be commenced, no building may be occupied, and in the case of
subdivisions, no lots may be sold until all of the requirements of this ordinance and all additional
requirements imposed pursuant to the issuance of a special exception or zoning permit have been
complied with.
Section 10. Who May Submit Permit Applications
1. Applications for zoning, special exception, sign permits, other permits, or minor subdivision plat
approval will be accepted only from persons having the legal authority to take action in
accordance with the permit or the minor subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration, in
general this means that applications should be made by the owners or lessees of property, or their
agents, or persons who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon their ability to
acquire the necessary permits under this ordinance, or the agents of such persons (who may make
application in the name of such owners, lessees, or contract vendees).
2. The Zoning Administrator shall require an applicant to submit evidence of his/her authority to
submit the application in accordance with Subsection 1 whenever there appears to be a reasonable
basis for questioning this authority.
Section 11. Applications To Be Complete
1. All applications for zoning, special exception, sign permits, or other permits must be complete
before the permit-issuing authority is required to consider the application.
2. Subject to Sections 1 and 5 of this Part, an application is complete when it contains all of the
information that is necessary for the permit-issuing authority to decide whether or not the
development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this
Ordinance.
3. In this Ordinance, detailed or technical design requirements and construction specifications
relating to various types of improvements (streets, sidewalks, etc.) are set forth in the Department
of Public Works Specifications and Design Standards Manual, and/or in one or more of the
IV-7
appendices to this ordinance. It is not necessary that the application contain the type of detailed
construction drawings that would be necessary to determine compliance with these appendices, so
long as the plans provide sufficient information to allow the permit-issuing authority to evaluate
the application in the light of the substantive requirements set forth in this text of this Ordinance.
However, whenever this Ordinance requires a certain element of a development to be constructed
in accordance with the detailed requirements set forth in one or more of these appendices, then no
construction work on such element may be commenced until detailed construction drawings have
been submitted to and approved by the Administrator. Failure to observe this requirement may
result in permit revocation, denial of final subdivision plat approval, or other penalty as provided
in Article VI.
4. The presumption established by this Ordinance is that all of the information set forth in the
Appendix A is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. However, it is recognized that
each development is unique, and therefore the permit-issuing authority may allow less
information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the particular
case. For applications submitted to the Board of Appeals, the applicant may rely in the first
instance on the recommendations of the Administrator as to whether more or less information
than that set forth in the Appendix A should be submitted.
5. The Administrator shall make every effort to develop application forms, instructional sheets,
checklists, or other techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application
requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted. In classes of cases
where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the Administrator to determine
compliance with this Ordinance, such as applications for zoning permits to construct singlefamily
or two-family houses, or applications for sign permits, the Administrator shall develop
standard forms that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required
information.
Section 12. Staff Consultation Before Formal Application
1. To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and
ensure compliance with the requirements of this ordinance, a preapplication meeting between the
developer and the Zoning Administrator is encouraged or required as provided in this section.
2. Before submitting an application for a zoning permit authorizing a development that consists of
or contains a major subdivision, the developer shall submit to the Planning Commission a preapplication
concept plan of such subdivision, drawn approximately to scale (1 inch = 100 feet).
The concept plan shall contain the information set forth in Appendix A.
The applicant may be placed on the agenda for the next available Planning Commission meeting.
Section 13. Staff Consultation After Application Submitted
1. Upon receipt of a formal application for a zoning, or special exception permit, the Administrator
shall review the application and confer with the applicant to ensure that he/she understands the
Town staff's interpretation of the applicable requirements of this ordinance, that he/she has
submitted all of the information required, and that the application represents precisely and
completely what he/she proposes to do.
IV-8
2. If the application is for a special exception permit, the Administrator shall place the application
on the agenda of the appropriate board when the applicant indicates that the application is as
complete as required. However, if the Administrator believes that the application is incomplete,
he shall recommend to the appropriate board that the application be denied on that basis.
Section 14. Authorizing Use or Occupancy Before Completion of Development Under Zoning
Permit
1. In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoningpermit
recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the zoningpermit
recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this ordinance prior to commencing the
intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the Administrator may authorize the
commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of
this ordinance are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a financial security satisfactory to
the Director of Building and Zoning to ensure that all of the requirements of this ordinance will
be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve (12) months) determined by the
Director of Building and Zoning .
2. With respect to subdivisions in which the developer is selling only undeveloped lots, the Planning
Commission may authorize final plat approval and the sale of lots before all the requirements of
this article are fulfilled if the subdivider provides a financial security from a local lending source
or other security satisfactory to the Town to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled
within not more than twelve (12) months after final approval.
Section 15. Completing Developments In Phases
1. As a prerequisite to taking advantage of constructing the development in phases, the developer
shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development and
the requirements of this Ordinance that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage.
2. If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that are designed to
relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts
in a residential development) then, as part of his application for development approval, the
developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such improvements. The schedule
shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of one or more phases or stages of
the entire development. Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the
permit-issuing authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied, and no subdivision
lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule approved.
Section 16. Expiration of Permits
1. Zoning, sign, and other permits shall expire automatically if, within six (6) months after the
issuance of such permits:
a. The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, or
b. Less than ten (10) percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration,
excavation, demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such permits
has been completed on the site. With respect to phased development (see Section 15 of
this Part), this requirement shall apply only to the first phase.
IV-9
2. If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to take place, such work is
discontinued for a period of six (6) months, then the permit authorizing such work shall
immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of
Section15 of this Part.
3. The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six (6) months the date when a permit
would otherwise expire pursuant to Subsections 1a. or 1b. above if it concludes that (1) the permit
has not yet expired, (2) the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith,
and (3) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive
extensions may be granted for periods up to six (6) months upon the same findings. All such
extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new
permit.
4. For purposes of this section, the permit within the jurisdiction of the Board of Appeals is issued
when such board votes to approve the application with or without conditions (written minutes of
such Board action will state conditions in full) and issue the permit. A permit within the
jurisdiction of the Zoning Administrator is issued when the earlier of the following takes place:
a. A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and delivery is
accomplished when the permit is hand-delivered or mailed to the permit applicant; or
b. The Zoning Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the applicant has been
approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for
the applicant to take certain specified actions, such as having the permit executed by the
property owner so it can be recorded if required.
5. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article VIII, this section shall be applicable to permits
issued prior to the date this section becomes effective.
Section 17. Effect Of Permit On Successors And Assigns
1. Zoning, special exception, sign, and other permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and
structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable, however, so long as the land or
structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for
which the permit was granted, then:
a. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may
make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized
in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit,
and,
b. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or
structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any
interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to
persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and
wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit
was originally issued.
2. Whenever a zoning, special exception, or variance permit is issued to authorize development,
nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the property signs a
IV-10
written acknowledgement that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in
the Elkton Town Hall and indexed under the record owner's name as grantor.
Section 18. Amendments to and Modifications of Permits
1. Insignificant deviations from the permit (including approved plans) issued by the Planning
Commission or the Administrator are permissible and the Administrator may authorize such
insignificant deviations. A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring
properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
2. Minor design modifications or changes in permits (including approved plans) are permissible
with the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained without a
formal application, public hearing, or payment of any additional fee. For purposes of this section,
minor design modifications or changes are those that have no substantial impact on neighboring
properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
3. All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed as new applications. If such
requests are required to be acted upon by the Planning Commission, new conditions may be
imposed, but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing
his request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued
permit.
4. The Administrator shall determine whether amendments to and modifications of permits fall
within the categories set forth above in Subsections 1., 2., and 3.
5. A developer requesting approval of changes shall submit a written request for such approval to
the Administrator, and that request shall identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be
given in writing.
Section 19. Maintenance of Common Areas, and Facilities
The recipient of any zoning, special exception, sign, or other permit, or his successor, shall be responsible
for maintaining all improvements, or facilities required by this ordinance or any permit issued in
accordance with its provisions (and in the case of apartments, all common areas), except those
improvements, or facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by
the Town. As illustrations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this means that private
roads and parking areas, water and sewer lines must be properly maintained so that they can be used in
the manner intended, and required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping, or shading must
be replaced if they die or are destroyed.
Section 20. Records of Zoning Administrators
The Zoning Administrator shall keep records of all zoning permits issued under this Ordinance; maintain
permanent and current records related to the Ordinance, including zoning maps, amendments, special
exceptions, variances, appeals, and planned unit development site plans
Section 21. Structures And Uses To Be As Provided In Building Permits, Plans, And
Certificates of Occupancy
Building permits or certificates of occupancy issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by
the Building Inspector authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such permits,
IV-11
plans, and certificates, and no other. The use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized
shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
Part II Special Exception Permits
Section 1. Intent
1. The development and execution of this Ordinance are based upon the division of the Town into
districts within which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any
particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon
neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location.
2. The intent of this Article is to establish procedures and minimum standards to be used as
guidelines for the consideration and authorization of those uses classified as special exceptions
under the respective District regulations.
3. The granting of a special exception does not exempt the applicant from complying with all other
requirements of this Ordinance or of the law.
Section 2. Initiation of Special Exceptions
Any property owner or other person with an enforceable legal interest in a property may file an
application to use such land for one or more of the special exceptions provided in the zoning district in
which the land is located.
Section 3. Application for Special Exception
Such application for special exception shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form prescribed
by the Zoning Administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data as
necessary, and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that
the proposed use will conform to the standards hereinafter set forth. Such application shall be forwarded
from the Zoning Administrator to the Planning Commission for recommendation to the Board of Appeals
for review within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the application by the Zoning Administrator. The
Board of Appeals shall, within sixty (60) days of receipt of application from the Zoning Administrator,
render a decision on the application.
Section 4. Hearing on Application
1. The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each application for a special exception at
such time and place as shall be established by the Board of Appeals. The hearing shall be
conducted and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner as the Board of
Appeals shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
2. Notice is required as provided in Article VI.
3. All Special Exception applications shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for a
recommendation.
IV-12
Section 5. Authorization
For each application for a special exception, the Board of Appeals shall normally, within sixty (60) days
of receipt of the application, conduct its public hearing and report its findings and decisions, including the
stipulations or additional conditions and guarantees deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest.
Section 6. Standards - General
No special exception shall be approved by the Board of Appeals unless such Board shall find:
1. That the establishment, maintenance, and operation of the special exception will not be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, convenience, morals, order or general
welfare.
2. That the special exception will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the
immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair
property values within the neighborhood.
3. That the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of any proposed structure will not be so
at variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the structures
already constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or the
character of the applicable district, as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property values
within the neighborhood.
4. That adequate utilities, water, sewer or septic system, access roads, storm drainage and/or other
necessary public facilities and improvements have been or are being provided.
5. That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as
to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
6. That the proposed special exception is not contrary to the objectives of the current
Comprehensive Plan for the Town of Elkton.
7. That the special exception shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the
district in which it is located or to the special requirements established for the specific use.
8. Conditions and Guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special exception, the Board of Appeals
shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction,
maintenance and operation of the special exception as is deemed necessary for the protection of
the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in
Article XII. In all cases in which special exceptions are granted, the Board of Appeals shall
require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with.
Section 7. Effect of Denial of a Special Exception
No application for a special exception which has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of Appeals
shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of said order of denial, except on the
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the Board of Appeals.
IV-13
Section 8. Complaints
Notice of complaints received by any representative of the Town concerning the operation of any special
exceptions shall be transmitted promptly to the Board which shall take appropriate action as provided by
law. The complainant shall be notified of the action taken.
Section 9. Revocation
1. Failure to Comply with Conditions. Whenever the Board shall find, in case of any permit
heretofore or hereafter granted pursuant to the provisions of this Article that any of the terms,
conditions, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, the
Board is authorized, after due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a
public hearing, to suspend or revoke such permit or take other action as it deems necessary to
ensure compliance. The Board is authorized to request and obtain investigations and reports as to
compliance from such Town or state agencies or administrative officers as may be appropriate.
2. Abandonment, etc. Whenever the Board shall determine that a special exception appears to have
been abandoned, that an approved special exception is not initiated within one (1) year after the
date of approval or that all of the terms and conditions of its grant are not being complied with,
the Administrator shall notify the board and the Town attorney's office. Upon receipts of notice of
such determination by the Board, the board shall issue an order to show cause why such special
exception should not be revoked. Notice thereof shall be given to the party to whom the special
exception has been granted and to all parties who would be entitled to receive notice of a new
application for special exception concerning the property. The applicant shall have sixty (60) days
from the date of written notice of expiration to file an appeal of said notice.
Section 10. Standards for Specific Special Exceptions
Certain buildings, structures, and uses of land developed as special exceptions are of such substantially
different character from other special exceptions that they require specific and additional standards to
guide the decision of the Board of Appeals. See Article XII for minimum standards for special exceptions.

ARTICLE V APPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS
Section 1. Appeals
1. An appeal from any final order or decision of the Administrator may be taken to the Board of
Appeals by any person aggrieved. An appeal is taken by filing with the Administrator and the
Board of Appeals a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. A notice of appeal
shall be considered filed with the Administrator and the Board of Appeals when delivered to the
Department of Building and Zoning, and the date and time of filing shall be entered on the notice
by the Administrator.
2. An appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of the signed decision or order
appealed from.
3. Whenever an appeal is filed, the Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Appeals
all the papers constituting the record relating to the action appealed from.
4. An appeal stays all actions by the Administrator seeking enforcement of or compliance with the
order or decision appealed from, unless the Administrator certifies to the Board of Appeals that
(because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to
life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the Board of
Appeals or a court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after
notice to the Administrator.
5. The Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order,
requirement or decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement,
decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end,
the Board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
6. An appeal from any final order or decision of the Planning Commission or Board of Appeals shall
be taken to the Circuit Court in the manner provided by law of Maryland and particularly the
Land Use Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. The appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days
after the date the decision is signed by the Chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Section 2. Variances
1. An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Appeals by filing a copy of the
application with the Zoning Administrator in the Department of Building and Zoning.
Applications shall be handled in the same manner as applications for zoning permits and special
exceptions in conformity with the provisions of Article IV, Part 1, Sections 10, 11, and 12.
2. A variance may be granted by the Board of Appeals if it concludes that strict enforcement of the
ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that,
by granting the variance, the spirit of the ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare
secured, and substantial justice done. It may reach these conclusions if it finds that:
a. If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of the ordinance, he/she can make no
reasonable use of his property,
b. That special conditions or circumstances exist that are unique to the subject property or
structure and that a strict enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in
V-2
unwarranted hardship which is not generally shared by owners of property in the same
land use classification, and:
(1) The hardship of which the applicant complains is one suffered by the applicant
rather than by neighbors or the general public;
(2) The hardship relates to the applicant's land, rather than personal circumstances;
(3) The hardship is unique, or nearly so, rather than one shared by many surrounding
properties;
(4) The hardship is not the result of the applicant's own actions; and
(5) That strict enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the
property owner of rights commonly shared by other owners of property in the
area.
c. That the granting of a variance will not confer upon an applicant any special privilege
that would be denied to other owners of like property and/or structures within the Zoning
District.
d. That the variance request is not based upon conditions or circumstances which
are self-created or self-imposed, nor does the request arise from conditions or
circumstances either permitted or non-conforming which are related to adjacent
parcels.
e. That greater profitability or lack of knowledge of the restrictions shall not be considered
as sufficient cause for a variance.
f. That the proposed variance is consistent with the Town of Elkton Comprehensive Plan.
g. The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming situation in violation
of Article VIII nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use of land.
3. In addition to the findings in 2 above, a variance may be granted by the Board of Appeals in the
Critical Area District provided:
a. That findings are made by the Board of Appeals which demonstrate that special
conditions or circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure within the
Elkton's Critical Area program, would result in unwarranted hardship;
b. That a literal interpretation of this subtitle or the Elkton Critical Area Program and the
Elkton Zoning Ordinances will deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by
other properties in similar areas within the Critical Area;
c. That the granting of a variance will not confer upon an applicant any special privilege
that would be denied by this subtitle or the Elkton Critical Area Program to other lands or
structures within the Critical Area;
V-3
d. That the variance request is not based upon conditions or circumstances which are the
result of actions by the applicant, nor does the request arise from any condition
conforming, on any neighboring property; and
e. That the granting of a variance will not adversely affect water quality or adversely impact
fish, wildlife, or plant habitat within the Critical Area, and that the granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general spirit and intent of the Critical Area Law
and the regulations adopted in this subtitle.
4. In granting variances, the Board of Appeals may impose such reasonable conditions as will
ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as
practicable with the surrounding properties.
5. A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only.
6. The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the
zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the
written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the
same manner as any other applicable requirement of this ordinance.
7. No application for variance, which has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of Appeals,
shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of said denial except on the
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the Board of
Appeals.
Section 3. Requests to Be Heard Expeditiously
The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide all appeals, variance requests, and requests for interpretations
as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to follow regularly established agenda procedures,
provide notice in accordance with Article VI, and obtain the necessary information to make sound
decisions.
Section 4. Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances
1. When an appeal is taken to the Board of Appeals in accordance with Section 1 of this Article, the
Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the Board sufficient evidence and
argument to justify the order or decision appealed from. The burden of presenting evidence and
argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of
persuasion.
2. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Appeals to reach the
conclusions set forth in Section 2.2. of this Article, as well as the burden of persuasion on those
issues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance.
Section 5. Board Action on Appeals and Variances
1. With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement, decision,
or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific
reasons or findings of facts that support the motion
V-4
2. A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or more of the seven criteria
set forth in Section 2.2. of this Article, are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete.
Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings
of fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the Board's decision if supported by a majority of
the Board's membership (excluding vacant seats).
3. Postponement of hearings shall be as follows:
a. Requests for postponement shall be filed in writing with the Zoning Administrator not
less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing, and shall be accompanied by a
sum of money sufficient to pay the cost of advertising the postponement and the
rescheduled hearing. The granting of such requests shall be at the discretion of the
Chairman of the Board.
b. Requests for postponement filed later than ten (10) days prior to the date of a scheduled
hearing, shall, in addition to the other requirements set forth in subsection a. above, be
supported by an affidavit of the party making the request or some other creditable person.
The granting of such request shall be at the discretion of the Board in cases of extreme
hardship or upon good cause shown.
c. The Board may, upon its own initiative, postpone a scheduled hearing at any time.
4. The Board may continue a hearing at another time and/or date once such hearing has
been started; however, the Board shall announce the date and hour of continuance of such
hearing while in session.

ARTICLE VI HEARING PROCEDURES FOR APPEALS AND APPLICATIONS
Section 1. Hearing Required on Appeals and Applications
1. Before making a decision on an appeal or an application for a variance, special exception, or a
petition from the planning staff to revoke a special exception, the Board of Appeals shall hold a
hearing on the appeal or application.
2. Subject to Subsection 3, the hearing shall be open to the public and all persons interested in the
outcome of the appeal or application shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and
arguments and ask questions of persons who testify.
3. The Board of Appeals may place reasonable and equitable limitations on the presentation of
evidence and arguments and the cross-examination of witnesses so that the matter at issue may be
heard and decided without undue delay.
4. The Board may continue the hearing until a subsequent meeting and may keep the hearing open
to take additional information up to the point a final decision is made. The Board shall announce
the date and hour of continuance of such hearing while in session.
Section 2. Notice of Hearing
The Administrator shall give notice of any hearing required by Section 1 of this Article, as follows:
1. Notice shall be given at least fifteen (15) days in advance of public hearing. Notice of such
hearings shall be posted on the subject property and at the Town Office, and notice shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
public hearing.
2. Notice shall be given to the appellant or applicant and any other person who makes a written
request for such notice by mailing to such persons a written notice before the hearing.
3. The notice required by this section shall state the date, time, and place of the hearing, reasonably
identify the lot that is the subject of the application or appeal, and give a brief description of the
action requested or proposed.
Section 3. Evidence
1. The provisions of this section apply to all hearings for which a notice is required by Section 1 of
this Article.
2. All persons who intend to present evidence to the Board, rather than arguments only, shall be

3. All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested permit or appeal
(crucial findings) shall be based upon reliable evidence. Competent evidence (evidence
admissible in a court of law) shall be preferred whenever reasonably available, but in no case may
crucial findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is not
reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to be particularly reliable, and the matter at
issue is not seriously disputed.

Section 4 Modification of Application at Hearing
1. In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions or
recommendations by the Board of Appeals, the applicant may agree to modify his/her application,
including the plans and specifications submitted.
2. Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the Board cannot reasonably be
expected to perceive the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before
it, the Board may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued
until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the planning staff.
Section 5. Record
1. A tape recording shall be made of all hearings required by Section 1 of this Article, and such
recordings shall be kept for at least two (2) years. Accurate minutes shall also be kept of all such
proceedings, and a transcript will be made.

of physical evidence shall be made a part of the record of the proceedings and shall be kept by the
Town for at least two (2) years.

1. Any decision made by the Board of Appeals regarding an appeal or variance or issuance or
revocation of a special exception shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant or
appellant and all other persons who make a written request for a copy.
2. In addition to a statement of the Board's ultimate disposition of the case and any other
information deemed appropriate, the written decision shall state the Board's findings and
conclusions, as well as supporting reasons or facts, whenever this ordinance requires the same as
a prerequisite to taking action.

VII-1
ARTICLE VII ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW
Building permits or certificates of occupancy issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by
the Zoning Administrator authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in such permits,
plans, and certificates, and no other. The use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
Section 1. Complaints Regarding Violations
Whenever the Zoning Administrator receives a written, signed complaint alleging a violation of this
ordinance, he shall investigate the complaint, take whatever action is warranted, and inform the
complainant in writing what actions have been or will be taken.

that is contrary to the requirements of this ordinance may be held responsible for the violation and suffer
the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided.
Section 3. Procedures Upon Discovery of Violations
1. If the Administrator finds that any provision of this ordinance is being violated, he shall send a
written notice to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation
and ordering the action necessary to correct it. Additional written notices may be sent at the
Administrator's discretion.
2. The final written notice (and the initial written notice may be the final notice) shall state what
action the Administrator intends to take if the violation is not corrected and shall advise that the
Administrator's decision or order may be appealed to the Board of Appeals in accordance with
Article V, Section 1.
3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously threaten the effective
enforcement of this ordinance or pose a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the
Administrator may seek enforcement without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties
or remedies authorized in Section 4 of this Article.
Section 4. Penalties and Remedies for Violations
1. Any person, firm, or corporation that violates any of the provisions of this Ordinance by
constructing or altering any building, site, property, parking areas, sidewalks or landscaping not
in accordance with a plan approved under the regulations herein, or defaces, removes, or destroys
an official warning, safety, or stop work sign, or who interferes with or threatens, in any manner,
any person engaged in the performance of a duty required by the terms of this Ordinance shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to Article XIV, §C14-1 of the Elkton Charter. Each
day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
2. All other violations of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of its
requirements shall constitute a municipal infraction. Any person who violates this Ordinance or

the property in accordance with the plans submitted, the requirements of this ordinance, or any
additional requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing board.
2. Before a special exception permit may be revoked, all of the notice and hearing and other
requirements of Article VI shall be complied with. The notice shall inform the permit recipient of
the alleged grounds for the revocation.
a. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to authorize the permit-issuing authority to
conclude that a permit should be revoked for any of the reasons set forth in Subsection 1.
shall be upon the party advocating that position. The burden of persuasion shall also be
upon that party.
b. A motion to revoke a permit shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the
specific reasons or findings of fact that support the motion.
3. Before a zoning or sign permit may be revoked, the administrator shall give the permit recipient
ten (10) days notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient of the alleged
reasons for the revocation and of his right to obtain an informal hearing on the allegations. If the
permit is revoked, the administrator shall provide to the permittee a written statement of the
decision and the reasons therefor.
4. No persons may continue to make use of land or buildings in the manner authorized by any
zoning, sign, or conditional-use permit after such permit has been revoked in accordance with this
section.

ARTICLE VIII NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Section 1. Intent
This Ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the
uses that are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these
districts, that nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses, substantially and adversely affecting the
orderly development and taxable value of other property in the district be permitted to continue only with
restrictions as herein contained. The purpose of this Article is to provide for the restrictions of
nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses, and to specify those circumstances and conditions under
which those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses shall be permitted to continue.
Section 2. Definitions
Unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases
defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article.
Dimensional Nonconformity. A nonconforming situation that occurs when the height, size, or minimum
floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings
or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located.
Effective Date of This Ordinance. Whenever this article refers to the effective date of this ordinance, the
reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this ordinance if the
amendment, rather than this ordinance as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.
Nonconforming Lot. A lot existing at the effective date of this ordinance (and not created for the purposes
of evading the restrictions of this ordinance) that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the
district in which the lot is located.
Nonconforming Project. Any structure, development, or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective
date of this ordinance and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it
is located if completed as proposed or planned.
Nonconforming Sign. A sign (see Article XVI, Section 1 for definition) that, on the effective date of this
ordinance does not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this ordinance, particularly
Article XVI.
Nonconforming Situation. A situation that occurs when, on the effective date of this ordinance, an
existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the
regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a
nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements, because
the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and setback
requirements) is not in conformity with this ordinance, or because land or buildings are used for purposes
made unlawful by this ordinance. Nonconforming signs shall not be regarded as nonconforming situations
for purposes of this article but shall be governed by the provisions of Article XVI, Section 17.
Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a
manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located.
(For example, a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use). The
term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property. (For example, all the activity
associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use.)
VIII-2
Section 3 Continuation of Nonconforming Situations and Completion of Nonconforming
Projects
1. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this ordinance and subject to the restrictions and
qualifications set forth in Sections 4 through 9 of this Article, nonconforming situations that were
otherwise lawful on the effective date of this ordinance may be continued.
2. Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of
this Article.
Section 4. Nonconforming Lots
1. In any zone in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed
by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings
may be erected on any single lot of record after the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the zone, provided that yard dimensions
shall conform to the regulations for the zone in which such lot is located.
2. If, on the date this section becomes effective, an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has
continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then
neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of
the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority
of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500
feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming
lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the
circumstances specified herein, but not to require such combination when that would be out of
character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed.
Section 5. Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations
1. Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes
an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical
alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such
activity results in:
a. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use, or
b. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback
requirements, height limitations, or density requirements or other requirements such as
parking requirements.
2. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that,
when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to
accommodate such use. A nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to
land outside the original building.
3. A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by
that use when it became nonconforming.
VIII-3
4. Notwithstanding Subsection 1. any single family or duplex structure use for residential purposes
and maintained as a nonconforming residential use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar
structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new
nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback and
parking requirements. This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in Section 8 of this
Article. (Amended September 26, 2017 Ordinance 08-2017)
5. A nonconforming structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
6. Notwithstanding Subsection 1., whenever: (1) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it,
and (2) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such
lot, and (3) the parking or loading requirements of Article XVII that would be applicable as a
result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area
available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed use
shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a
nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable
parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall
also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with Article XVII, Part 1, Section 9, if:
(1) parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is
required; and (2) such satellite parking is reasonably available. If such satellite parking is not
reasonably available at the time the zoning or special- or conditional-use permit is granted, then
the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available.
This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit.
Section 6. Repair, Maintenance, Reconstruction
1. Minor repairs to, improvements that do not increase nonconformity, and routine maintenance of
property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation,
i.e., work estimated to cost more than 25% of the appraised valuation of the structure to be
renovated may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section.
2. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that
the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 25% of the appraised valuation of the damaged
structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a
zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used
for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning
permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in Section 5.4. of this Article.
3. For purposes of Subsections 1. and 2:
a. The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the
materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement.
b. The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such
intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of Subsections 1. or 2. by
doing such work incrementally.
c. The "appraised valuation" shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax
purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date
of increase in the consumer price index since the last date of valuation, or the valuation
determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser.
VIII-4
4. The Zoning Administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he/she finds that, in
completing the renovation, repair or replacement work:
a. No violation of Section 5 of this Article will occur, and
b. The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this
ordinance applicable to the existing use (except that the permittee shall not lose his right
to continue a nonconforming use).
c. Compliance with a requirement of this ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance
cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming
situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent
foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as
paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably
possible.
Section 7. Change in Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists
1. A change in use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) that is sufficiently
substantial to require a new zoning or special-use permit in accordance with Article IV, Part 1,
Section 1., may not be made except in accordance with Subsections 2. through 4. However, this
requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed.
2. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the
property is located, and all of the other requirements of this ordinance applicable to that use can
be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as
permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this ordinance is
achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status.
3. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the
property is located, but all of the requirements of this ordinance applicable to that use cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the Zoning Administrator issues a
permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the zoning administrator finds, in
addition to any other findings that may be required by this ordinance, that:
a. The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 5 of this Article, and
b. All of the applicable requirements of this ordinance that can reasonably be complied with
will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this ordinance is not reasonably
possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where
the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a
permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such
requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is
not reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to
this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional
nonconformities would thereby created.
4. If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming, then the
change is permissible if the Zoning Administrator, upon recommendation of the Planning
VIII-5
Commission, issues a permit authorizing the change. The Zoning Administrator may issue the
permit if it is found, in addition to other findings that may be required by this ordinance, that:
a. The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with a zoning or
special-use permit, and
b. All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in Subsection 3. of this section
are satisfied, and
c. The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by
it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in
operation at the time the permit is applied for.
Section 8. Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situation
1. When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days , the property
involved shall thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, with the exception of any existinf
structure originally constructed as a single family, detached residential house. Such residential
structure may continue to be used as a single-family home until it is removed or replaced with a
conforming structure. (Amendment 8-2015, effective 1/26/16)
2. If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming
use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of one year, then that property shall thereafter
be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the
zoning administrator issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without
correcting the nonconforming situations. This permit may be issued if the Zoning Administrator
finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be
accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is
maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The approval of
said permit shall not have the effect of increasing the nonconformity nor shall it have the effect of
increasing the intensity of the nonconformity. The permit shall specify which nonconformities
need not be corrected
3. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost
pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are
generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building for one year shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that
apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously
maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to
maintain it thereafter.
4. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this ordinance is vacant or discontinued at
the effective date of this ordinance, the one-year period for purposes of this section begins to run
on the effective date of this ordinance.
Section 9. Completion of Nonconforming Projects
1. Construction may be begun and/or completed under the terms of a building permit issued prior to
the effective date of this section, if such permit was in force and fully valid on that date. Such
construction is subject to:
VIII-6
a. All terms of the permit;
b. The ordinance under which it was issued; and
c. If applicable, the provisions of subsection 4.
2. Any of the following pending matters filed prior to the effective date of this section shall be
processed and/or decided in accordance with the ordinance in effect on the date on which the
particular matter was filed:
a. Applications for building permit;
b. Applications for approval of a subdivision or site plan approval, if such application
received preliminary approval by the Planning Commission prior to the effective date of
this section; and
c. Any matters pending before the Board of Appeals on appeal or by way of application for
a special exception.
3. A project may be begun and/or completed in accordance with final site plan or final subdivision
plat approval given prior to the effective date of this section and in accordance with a final
approval given to a preliminary site plan or a preliminary subdivision plat in accordance with
subsection 2.b, under the terms of the ordinance governing such approval. However, any such
final approval shall expire at the later of:
a. One (1) year from the effective date of this section, or
b. One (1) year from the date of final approval.
4. With respect to any building permit or pending matters referred to in subsection 1, 2,
and 3, nothing in this section shall be construed:
a. To affect the status of any use or structure involved in any such permit, application,
approval or pending matter as a nonconforming use or structure under this Ordinance;
b. To extend, enlarge or otherwise affect the provisions of any prior ordinance relating to
the duration, expiration or termination of any such permit, application, approval or
pending matter; or
c. To revive or give any other effect to any permit, application, approval or pending matter
which has been, or is hereafter deemed to be, abandoned or terminated under the
provisions of this Ordinance or any prior ordinance which is applicable.
5. Extensions.
a. On written application of the owner prior to the expiration of any permit, approval or
other authorization, the Planning Commission may grant a single one-year extension of
time to complete the undertaking or project authorized by any permit, approval, or other
authorization it has granted.
VIII-7
b. The Planning Commission may grant an extension for any permit, approval or other
authorization if it determines that the owner has diligently proceeded with development
of the undertaking or project.
Section 10. Setback Variance
Owner(s) of a residential dwelling located on a lot recorded prior to 1970, which, by adoption of a
subsequent Zoning Ordinance, was made nonconforming with regard to setbacks, may request a variance
as to setbacks required for improvements to the residence so long as the improvement complies with all
other requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. (amended Ordinance 03-2018, effective March 27, 2018)

ARTICLE IX ZONING DISTRICTS
Part I Zoning Districts
Section 1. Districts Established
The incorporated area of the Town of Elkton shall be divided into ten (10) zoning districts: "RP",
Resource Protection District; "R-1", Town Estate District; "R-2", Suburban Residential District; "R-3",
Urban Residential District; "TC", Town Center District; "R-O" Residential-Office District; "C-1", Central
Business District; "C-2", Highway Commercial District; C-3, Highway Interchange District; and "BI",
Business and Industrial District. The districts shall be established to regulate and restrict the location of
residences, trades, industries, and buildings erected or altered for specific uses; to regulate and limit the
height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or structurally altered; to regulate and limit population
density and the intensity of the use of lot areas; and to regulate and determine the areas of yards, courts,
and other open spaces with and surrounding such buildings.
Section 2. Residential Districts
1. R-1: Town Estate -- Low Density
The intent of this district is to provide for low-density single-family detached residences and
supporting uses. This zone is located in areas of the Town where low-density single-family
development patterns are generally established or where services and facilities will be adequate to
serve the anticipated population. This zone is designed to secure for residents a comfortable,
healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and
disruptive activities that properly belong in non-residential districts. The Comprehensive Plan
should be used to determine the location of this zone. This zone is also intended to provide for
minor in-filling of existing neighborhoods consistent with their zoning and character at the time
of enactment of this Ordinance. Such neighborhoods are relatively uniform in character and
stable. The regulations permit future development consistent with existing character. In general,
re-subdivision of lots in existing subdivisions to create additional building lots is not permitted.
2. R-2: Suburban Residential -- Medium Density
The intent of this district is to provide for medium-density single-family detached residences and
supporting uses. This zone is located in areas of the Town where medium-density single-family
development patterns are generally established or where services and facilities will be adequate to
serve the anticipated population. The Comprehensive Plan should be used to determine location
of this zone. This zone is also intended to provide for minor in-filling of existing neighborhoods
consistent with their zoning and character at the time of enactment of this Ordinance. Such
neighborhoods are relatively uniform in character and stable. The regulations permit future
development consistent with existing character. In general, re-subdivision of lots in existing
subdivisions to create additional building lots is not permitted.
3. R-3: Urban Residential
This zone is primarily for multi-family dwellings and supporting uses at a higher density than is
provided for in either R-1 or R-2 zones. Within this zone, a variety of housing-types mixes --
including single-family, two-family, duplexes, townhouses, apartments and condominiums -- are
encouraged in order to provide for a mix in housing prices, household size, age groups, and
lifestyles. Residential cluster is encouraged for development on minimum lot areas to provide for
IX-2
additional open space for common use by local residents as well as by the adjacent community.
Recreation, health, and social service facilities for the elderly and handicapped are also
encouraged in this zone.
Section 3. Commercial/Business Districts
1. R-O: Residential-Office District
The purpose of this district is to provide for a mixture of residential uses and business uses that
are not unduly disruptive of high density residential areas located in the same district. Generally
this district covers the mixed use areas bordering the commercial center of the Town.
2. C-1: Central Business District
The purpose of this district is to provide appropriate locations for select commercial activities.
Provision is made for accommodation of a wide range of business pursuits, retail sales and office
and service activities which serve the needs of citizens of the area. The district is designed to
preserve, and to encourage the continued development, as well as redevelopment, of small-scale
commercial uses near the Town Center zone consistent with the unique land use mix which
currently exists. Generally this district covers certain areas close to the historic commercial center
of the Town and as such is intended for the conduct of general business to which the public
requires direct and frequent access, but which is not characterized either by constant heavy
trucking other than stocking and delivery of light retail goods, or by any nuisance factors other
than associated by incidental light and noise of congregation of people and passenger vehicles.
This district also provides for some residential uses.
3. C-2: Highway Commercial
The intent of this zone is to provide for the local and regional oriented business with a variety of
office and commercial uses that are not suitable for location in other zones. This zone is primarily
automobile accessible and allows for more intensive uses than the C-1 zone. This zone is adjacent
to major transportation routes and is in locations where new development can be grouped with
existing compatible development.
4. C-3: Highway Interchange Commercial
The intent of this zone is to provide for the concentration of a variety of business and light
industrial uses in planned developments serving as regional employment centers in the vicinity of
the I-95/MD 273 Interchange. Planned (mixed use) Business development located on sites that
exhibit a park-like character while protecting the environment as well as the surrounding
community are encouraged. These zones are located where larger areas of land permit horizontal
expansion of sufficient size to provide on-site storage, parking, and landscaped areas and can be
reasonably served by a complete array of community facilities. The office park location also
provides for ready access to the regional transportation network.
Section 4. Industrial District
1. BI: Business and Industrial District
The purpose of this District is to provide areas in which the principal use of land and buildings is
for business services, light manufacturing and assembly plants, processing storage, warehousing,
IX-3
wholesaling and distribution. It is the intent that permitted uses be conducted so that noise, odor,
dust, and glare of each operation is confined within an enclosed building.
Section 5. Town Center District
1. TC: Town Center District
The intent of the Town Center District is to provide for a mix of land uses including residential
and commercial uses that primarily provide local goods and services within the central business
district and historic district. This zone is located in the central areas of the Town where a
moderate and high density mixed-use development patterns are generally established and where
building reuse and infill to create higher densities are encouraged. The district is designed to
create lively, safe, human-scaled gathering places for the community through building design and
orientation and by encouraging a mix of uses. The intent is to create a pedestrian-friendly
environment that encourages walking, bicycling and transit use. This zone is also intended to
ensure an attractive, inviting pedestrian-oriented setting through supplementary appearance,
parking, and sign regulations.
Section 6. Planned Development Districts
1. PUD: Reserved.
2. B-P: Planned Business Park District. The BP Planned Business Park District is intended to
encourage innovative and creative design of commercial, business and industrial development;
facilitate use of the most advantageous construction techniques; and maximize the conservation
and efficient use of open space and natural features. The districts are designed to further the
purposes and provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and to conserve public fiscal resources;
efficiently utilize public facilities; and provide a broad range of economic opportunities to present
and future residents of the Town.
Section 7. Resource Protection District
RP: Resource Protection District. The Resource Protection includes those existing natural areas in
the own which are likely to remain in their natural state or developed in low intensity uses such as
parkland. These areas include steep land, floodplains, Resource Conservation Areas (RCA)
associated with the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Program, stream valley and buffers, wetlands,
and town parklands. The purpose of the Resource Protection District is to provide special
regulatory protection for the land and water resources and to recognize general areas, where
sensitive natural features and other development constraints limit uses or where special land use
development requirements are imposed for the express purpose of protecting and enhancing water
quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and maintaining or protecting sensitive wildlife
habitats. Included in this classification are areas best suited for open space or low intensity
recreation uses. Permitted development in these areas should be strictly regulated, to ensure
minimum adverse environmental impacts, with special attention given to maintaining natural
conditions.
Section 8. Floating Zones
1. Purpose. Floating zones are zones that have areas designated for them in the Elkton
Comprehensive Plan but are not mapped out in detail at the time of adoption of the most recent
IX-4
comprehensive revision to the Elkton Zoning Ordinance. The purpose of the designated floating
zones is to permit the mapping of areas for land uses that require land area over the next 20 years.
The designated floating zone provides a mechanism for the establishment of the district in
appropriate areas, limiting the areas to be zoned and setting conditions that must be met by any
development proposal seeking such a designation. Further, the procedure is two-stage so that the
initial costs are not prohibitive.
2. Designation of Floating Zones. The following Special Zoning Districts are designated as floating
zones:
a. Reserved
b. Planned Business Development District - B-P
c. Growth Allocation District (Critical Area) - GA
The Town Commissioners and Planning Commission find that it is not able to locate these areas
with precision in advance and that it is desirable to leave specific locations and conditions for
future determination as the Town grows and specific needs develop.
IX-5
Part II Special Overlay District - Highway Corridor
Section 1. Purpose
1. The purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect and/or enhance the aesthetic and
visual character of the Town of Elkton and to provide for and promote orderly growth of the
same. The overlay district regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the
underlying zoning districts and to provide for the harmony and compatibility of development
along the highway corridors. All development proposed within this District shall be subject to the
procedures, standards, and guidelines specified in the following sections, in addition to those
standards pertaining to the particular base zoning district in which the development occurs. In
particular, the purpose of the Special Overlay District is as follows:
a. To encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the Town's major
existing and proposed highways.
b. To provide for the continued safe and efficient use of these roadways.
c. To maintain natural beauty and scenic, cultural, and historic character of the corridor,
particularly distinctive views, vistas, and visual continuity.
d. Minimize intersection and site access points.
These purposes will be accomplished through evaluation of proposed developments within this
zoning district by the Planning Commission which shall review the location, character and
appearance of new development in accordance with these regulations. It is the purpose of such
review to determine, in a cooperative fashion with the applicant, whether a proposed plan meets
the guidelines and other standards of this zoning district.
2. The Highway Corridor Overlay Zoning District shall include all lands within 500 feet of each
side of the center line of the following rights-of-way: U.S. 40, I-95, MD 213 and MD 279. Where
a property along the above-mentioned roadways is annexed into the town, the Highway Corridor
Overlay Zoning District shall be automatically extended across said property. The approximate
boundary of the overlay district shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map and shall be shown as
a surveyed line by the applicant on each property subject to review.
Section 2. Affected Development
1. All development plan applications for development located in the Highway Corridor Overlay
District shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission. All changes subject to approval by the
Commission shall receive such approval before proceeding. If a portion of the corridor will not be
visible from the road once the project is completed, the Commission may waive review of that
portion.
2. Development Activity Permitted Within The District.
a. There shall be no alteration of the existing condition of the lands, uses or structures
within the Special Overlay District from the date of enactment of this section henceforth
except as provided for by this section or by other sections of this Article.
b. The overlay district regulations are supplementary to the permitted uses and requirements
for the appropriate underlying zoning district as contained in Article IX of this ordinance.
IX-6
3. Development activity prohibited within the district. Uses prohibited in the underlying zoning
district are also prohibited in the overlay district.
Section 3. Reserved
Section 4. Retention of and/or Creation of a Minimum Visual Buffer along Highway Corridor
Right-of-Ways
1. Each approved application for development shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the
right-of-way line of the subject roadway and all proposed structures and parking areas. The
purpose of the minimum visual buffer is to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots
from the road, to screen vehicular headlight glare on and off site, and to lessen spill-over light
from on-site lighting. The buffer shall be continuous, except as set forth in 2. below, and be no
less than the requirements for Bufferyard B contained in Article XVIII and Appendix C depth
across the existing right-of-way line or from the new right-of-way line should the application
under consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication of or easement for
proposed roadway purposes. The minimum Bufferyard depth shall not occur at the high activity
areas of a project. These areas include, but are not limited to, building entrances, drop-offs, and
drive-thrus.
To determine the average depth of the minimum visual buffer, measurements shall be taken at
intervals not greater than ten (10) feet perpendicular to the property line. Side buffer areas
required by other sections of this ordinance and deep, narrow land areas shall not be used when
calculating the minimum visual buffer. Where lagoons and drainage swales occur in the minimum
visual buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patterns, additional buffer depth and
vegetation shall be required to augment the screening effect.
2. The intent of the minimum visual buffer is to leave the naturally occurring buffer vegetation
intact for its softening effect. This buffer may be enhanced or created, where such vegetation is
insufficient or non-existent, with trees and shrubs of a variety of species appropriate to Town
character. If the minimum visual buffer already has trees of protected size and species as noted in
Article XVIII, their preservation is required. Where masses of native shrubs are present, their
preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged. While complete screening of a
project is not required, sufficient plant material shall be installed to accomplish the softening
effect required in 1. above. In order to maintain the screening effect, existing vegetation shall not
be limbed-up from the ground more than five (5) feet to the lowest branches. However, if
understory planting is planned, existing vegetation may, with the approval of the Zoning
Administrator, be limbed-up to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to those plants.
Minimum height and caliper of new trees shall be consistent with provisions of the tree protection
requirements in Section 3 of this Part. Minimum height of new shrubs used to create the
minimum visual buffer shall be three (3) feet.
Section 5. Exemptions From Buffer Requirements
Exemptions, whether partial or total, from the bufferyard provisions may be granted if it can be
sufficiently demonstrated that such bufferyard will have a deleterious visual effect upon an existing
situation or that through the preservation of existing tree stand or other unique natural vegetative resource,
particular effort on the part of a developer in protecting the existing natural environment warrants the
relaxation of bufferyard requirements. The following outlines those anticipated situations where the
bufferyard requirement may be relaxed or removed.
IX-7
1. Protection of existing visual environment. In the following cases where the characteristics of the
existing visual environment would be detracted from by the provision of a required bufferyard:
a. Views and Vistas of existing buildings which exhibit a high degree of aesthetic value
serving to heighten the visual experience, serve as important points of spatial
identification, contain value as important historical resources.
b. Views and Vistas of existing natural landscape/topographical features of a particular
locale which correspond to certain high points affording panoramic views, views to
settlement clusters, views of water, valleys, and other elements of the physical landscape.
c. Views and Vistas to existing recreational/open space areas, whether natural or man-made,
which serve to contribute to the overall visual environment. Uses such as golf-courses,
local parks, cemeteries.
d. Views and Vistas to which give the observer an awareness of a locations inherent
character related to views of farmland, pastures, water activities, such as docks or other
maritime activities specific to the area.
2. Protection of proposed visual environment. In the following cases, where a proposed
development intended to further enhance or protect the existing visual environment would be
visually affected by the required bufferyard:
a. A proposed development which by virtue of the characteristics of its structures indicates
innovation of design, a unique relationship with the site, represents a focal point,
establishes a particular identifying element for the locale.
b. A proposed development which exhibits innovative or unique uses of site landscaping, or
which combines in the use of the site open recreational areas such as described above.
3. Retention of existing natural attributes of the site. In this case, significant steps must be taken by
a developer to preserve significant tree stands, topographic characteristics, even in the event that
such elements are in locations where they are not wholly visible. The intent is to provide
incentives to retain the features of the existing natural environment rather than encourage its
destruction, and then to remedy the situation with new plantings.
4. Management of existing and proposed resources. In order to encourage management programs for
visual natural resources, so that the continuation of such resource is assured, bufferyard
requirements may be reduced or waived.
Section 6. Permitted Activity in Minimum Visual Buffer Before and After Development
1. No existing vegetation of any type, size, or origin shall be altered or removed unless it satisfies
the tree protection requirements of Section 3 of this Part.
2. Within the minimum visual buffer there shall be no development, clearing, grading, or
construction activity, except for the following:
a. Roadway and/or driveway access to the portion of the site not in the minimum visual
buffer provided that it is approximately perpendicular to right-of-way.
IX-8
b. Provision for water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, electrical, telephone, natural gas,
cable, etc. service lines provided they are approximately perpendicular to the right-ofway.
In the event that utilities must be installed approximately parallel to the road rightof-
way, an equal amount of buffer may be required to substitute for the area of vegetation
removal. Permission for easement and right-of-way disturbance and clearing for such
services shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with
vehicular access routes.
c. Pedestrian and bicycle paths designed to provide continuous connection along the road
corridor, provided that they can be constructed without materially reducing the screening
and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer.
d. Lighting fixtures only for approved signs or if, for safety reasons, they cannot be placed
outside the buffer and then only when electric utility lines serving these fixtures and
necessary easements can be established and constructed without reducing the screening
and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer.
e. Signs in accordance with the sign regulations in Article XVI reasonable effort should be
made to locate all signage outside of the buffer.
f. Clear sight distances at the permitted entrances and exits to any development as needed to
provide for reasonable traffic safety, in accordance with accepted traffic engineering
practices.
g. The addition of plantings, earth forms, or other visual buffers that, in the opinion of the
Commission, would better achieve the purpose set out in Appendices B and C than would
otherwise be the case.
Section 7. Architectural Review
1. Guidelines. The compatible relationship of architecture along highway corridors is of public
concern. The intent of the architectural review is not to stifle innovative architectural design but
to assure respect for, and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on, the visual experience from
the roadway. To accomplish this, the Planning Commission shall use the following guidelines in
reviewing proposed structures, site improvements, signs, and streetscape improvements within
the Highway Corridor Overlay Zone:
a. Proposed development shall avoid excessive or unsightly grading, indiscriminate earth
moving or clearing of property, and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause
disruption of natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms.
b. Proposed development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner
with the terrain and vegetation of the parcel and surrounding parcels. Structures shall
impede, as little as reasonably practical, scenic views from the main road or from existing
structures and the natural environment. Structures shall not dominate, by excessive or
inappropriate height or mass, any general development, adjacent building, or natural
landscape in an incompatible manner.
c. The architectural design of structures and their materials and colors shall be visually
harmonious with the overall appearance, history, and cultural heritage of the Town, with
IX-9
natural land forms and existing vegetation and with other development plans approved by
the Town. Specific consideration shall be given to compatibility with adjacent properties
where such projects demonstrate the Town's character.
(1) Large work area doors or open bays shall not open toward or face the highway.
(2) Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning equipment, duct work, air compressors,
other fixed operating machinery shall be either screened from view or located so
that such items are not visible from the highway. Large trash receptacles,
dumpsters, utility meters, above-ground tanks, satellite dishes, antennas, etc.,
shall be similarly treated, as practicably as possible.
(3) Mobile homes and office-type mobile units shall be screened from view from the
highway and equipped with skirting on all sides.
(4) All development, including those in which the principal facade is oriented to the
interior of the lot, shall be designed so that all facades visible from the roadway
or from adjacent sites shall be completed in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
(5) No temporary structures are permitted except those used in conjunction with and
during construction projects.
(6) Fencing along the highway right-of-way is discouraged, but, if used, such fencing
shall be of quality materials (brick, stone, wood) and shall be landscaped to
minimize visibility from the highway.
(7) Long monotonous facade designs including, but not limited to, those
characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form such as blank walls or by
unbroken extension of line shall be avoided.
(8) Materials with similar texture and appearance as appropriate to the Town's
character.
(9) Generally, no more than three colors per building should be used. Semitransparent
stains are recommended for application on natural wood finishes.
(10) The location and dimensions of wall signs shall be indicated and shall maintain
compatibility with architectural features of the building.
(11) Architectural lighting shall be recessed under roof overhangs or generated from
concealed source, low level light fixtures.
(12) Building massing should reflect proportion and scale appropriate to the existing
Town design.
d. It is assumed that proposed building development that is consistent with the requirements
of Section XX of this Ordinance regarding the Town Center (TC) District is consistent
with the architectural design requirements of this Section.
e. The landscape plans for the proposed development shall provide visually harmonious and
compatible setting for structures on the same lot and on adjoining or nearby lots and shall
IX-10
blend with the surrounding landscape. Natural appearing landscape forms are strongly
encouraged; formal plans and the appearance of straight hedges are discouraged.
Landscaping shall be required between buildings and sidewalks, parking lots and
driveways. The scale of the proposed landscaping shall be in proportion to the building.
f. Site lighting shall be of low-intensity from a concealed source, shall be of a clear white
light that does not distort colors, and shall not spill over into adjoining properties, buffers,
roadways, or in any way interfere with the vision of on-coming motorists.
g. To the extent that they relate to aesthetic considerations, the design and construction
techniques of the proposed development shall respond to energy consumption and
environmental quality considerations such as heat loss, heat gain, air emission, and runoff
water quality.
h. Streetscape Improvements and External Changes.
(1) Streetscape improvements include those architectural or functional facilities or
structures that occur on site but are not part of the building and that encourage
and facilitate human interaction with the environment. Examples include, but are
not limited to the following: decorative light fixtures, fountains, sculpture,
benches and tables, planters, retaining walls, pedestrian and bicycle paths,
bicycle parking structure, trash receptacles and enclosures, vendor areas,
bollards, and fences. These improvements shall be designed to be consistent with
all guidelines listed above, and shall be reviewed for aesthetic functionality and
compatibility with the Town's character.
(2) Decorative, low-level intensity, non-concealed source lighting that defines
vehicular and/or pedestrian ways may be acceptable if part of a lighting master
plan. It is strongly discouraged as general lighting for a development. The master
plan must show the relationship of the fixtures and the light patterns to each
other, to the project site, to unit development, and to the highway corridors.
(3) External changes to streetscape improvements and existing structures and sites
subject to review by the Commission shall be consistent with all guidelines and
standards in this section. External changes of a minor nature include external
color and structural material changes, parking lot additions and alterations,
relocation of accessory structures, and similar minor changes as determined by
the Zoning Administrator. Some minor external changes may also require
development plan approval (see Article IV).
i. Signs, permanent.
(1) Applicants for new or replacement signs in the Special Overlay District shall
apply to the Planning Commission for review at the time of full development
review or as a separate application.
(2) The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to approve or disapprove the
appearance of features of such proposed signs and the Administrator's approval
shall be given only after the Commission's approval is granted.
(3) All signs shall meet all requirements of Article XVI.
IX-11
(4) The amount of information on signs shall be no more than is necessary to provide
reasonable identification of the name of the business to the passerby. While
corporate logos that are part of a business name or business identification are
authorized within Article XVI, color and size are reviewed under subsection (1).
(5) An integrated sign system design shall be required for all new Planned
Developments (PDs), commercial and residential subdivisions, office complexes,
and shopping centers within the Highway Corridor District. The establishment of
integrated sign systems for existing developments is strongly encouraged. These
systems shall be reviewed for materials, colors, shapes, sizes, compatibility with
architecture, and establishment of unity of design for the development. Individual
signs shall be reviewed for conformance with such sign systems, whether newly
established or existing.
(6) Materials, colors, and shapes of proposed signs shall be compatible with the
related building(s). Size and proportions shall not be a dominant feature of the
site and shall be judged by sizes and proportions of signs on adjacent and nearby
properties that are compatible with the Town's character.
(7) Spot-lighting of signs shall be restricted to not more than one 150-watt light per
side for sign faces up to 40 square feet and nor more than two 150-watt lights per
sign faces over 40 square feet. The sign base and/or proposed landscaping shall
be designed to shield the light from on-coming motorists and to conceal the light
fixture.
i. Signs, temporary.
(1) Temporary signs within the Special Overlay District shall comply with the design
guidelines set forth in this section for colors and materials and with Article XVI
and shall be reviewed for such compliance by the Zoning Administrator.
(2) In the case of multiple principals (for example, owner, developer, architect,
engineer, contractor, or real estate or leasing agent), all information shall be
contained on a single sign not to exceed the maximum size and height allowed in
Article XVI.
(3) Temporary signs within the corridor shall not be lighted.
2. Following project completion, all design features required by the Town or shown on approved
plans shall be maintained in good condition by all subsequent owners of the property. Changes
proposed shall require approval by the Commission.
Section 8. Waivers of Corridor Requirements
The Planning Commission may waive one or more of the specific requirements of the Special Overlay
District upon a showing by the applicant that these corridor regulations impose an undue hardship due to
the peculiar configuration, topography, or location of the tract, or that the proposed project demonstrates
the use of highly innovative architectural, site planning, or land use techniques. The Commission may
approve any waiver to the minimum extent necessary to allow the project to be constructed. The applicant
for any such waiver shall have the burden of showing that the proposed project, with such waiver granted,
IX-12
will be as good or better than a project developed in compliance with the District regulations in terms of
environmental protection, aesthetic enhancement, land use compatibility, and traffic considerations.
Section 9. Planning Commission Review
Applicability. All development proposed in the Special Overlay District and other applicable projects
shall submit an application to the Zoning Administrator for review by the Planning Commission. Such
application shall be reviewed for consistency with the guidelines and standards found in this Article and
according to the submission and review requirements in this article and or the Town Subdivision
Regulations.

f. Consider the property owners’ comments and desires; and,
g. A unanimous vote of the Mayor and Commissioners will be required to designate the site
as a Town Historic Overlay Zone.
Section 6. Application for Historic District Work Permit and Commission Review
1. Application for Historic District Work Permit. Before the construction, alteration, reconstruction,
moving, or demolition is undertaken of a designated landmark, site, or structure, or site or
structure within designated district, if an exterior change is involved which would affect the
historic, archeological, or architectural significance of a designated landmark, site, or structure, or
structure within a designated district, any portion of which is visible or intended to be visible from
a public way, the person, individual, firm, or corporation proposing to make the construction or
change shall file an application for a Historic District Work Permit with the Commission for
permission to construction, alter, reconstruct, move, or demolish the landmark, site, or structure.
Every application shall be referred to and considered by the Commission and accepted or rejected
by the Commission. An application which is identical to a rejected application may not be
resubmitted within a period of one year after the rejection. No Historic District Work Permit shall
be granted until the Commission has acted thereon as hereinafter provided. A Historic District
Work Permit shall lapse upon the expiration of the corresponding Building Permit. In the event a
Building Permit is not required, the Historic District Work Permit shall lapse six (6) months from
its issuance if substantial work is not underway. For good cause shown, this period may be
extended by the Commission.
Specific items requiring Historic District Work Permits include, but are not limited to the
following: repair or replacement of roofs, gutters, siding, external doors and windows, external
trim, external lights, and other external appurtenant fixtures, with different materials and/or
different design; removal of a building, structure, or object, or a visible portion thereof, including
out-buildings; new construction or any enlargement, modification, or alteration of the exterior of
an existing building, structure or object which require a building permit; removal, replacement or
IX-18
enclosure of porches; basic alteration of materials, including installation of siding, shingles or
masonry facing; removal of significant healthy trees; installation or removal of shutters; new
paving or modification of paving materials in front of building line; removal, modification or
alteration of exterior architectural features; first time painting, removal of paint or substantially
changing the color of paint; exterior sandblasting; performing any grading, excavating,
construction, or substantially modifying, changing or altering the environmental setting; erecting
or causing to be erected and sign or advertisement (with the exception of those signs which are
erected temporarily for such purposes as advertising the sale of the property site or promoting a
political viewpoint) on exterior structures or in the environmental setting; any other act which
does not constitute ordinary maintenance but which modifies, alters, or otherwise affects the
exterior features of a Historic Resource within the Historic Overlay Zone.
2. Application Review.
a. In reviewing applications, the Commission shall give consideration to the historic,
archeological, or architectural significance of the landmark, site, or structure and its
relationship to the historic, archeological, or architectural significance of the surrounding
area; the relationship of the exterior architectural features of a landmark or structure to
the remainder of the landmark or structure and to the surrounding area; the general
compatibility of proposed exterior design, scale, proportion, arrangement, texture, and
materials to the landmark, site, or structure and to the surrounding area; and any other
factors including aesthetic factors which the Commission deems to be pertinent.
b. The Commission shall consider only exterior features of a landmark or structure and shall
not consider any interior arrangements.
c. The Commission shall not disapprove an application except with respect to the several
factors specified in paragraph (1) above.
d. The Commission shall be strict in its judgment of plans for sites or structures determined
by research to be of historic, archeological, or architectural significance. The
Commission shall be lenient in its judgment of plans for sites or structures of little
historic, archeological, or architectural significance, or of plans involving new
construction, unless in the Commission’s judgment such plans would seriously impair the
historic, archeological, or architectural significance of surrounding sites or structures.
The Commission is not required to limit construction, reconstruction, or alteration to the
architectural style of any one (1) period.
(1) If an application is submitted for construction, reconstruction, or alteration
affecting a site or the exterior of a structure or for the moving or demolition of a
structure, the preservation of which the Commission considers to be of unusual
importance to the Town of Elkton or of unusual importance to the State or the
nation, the Commission shall attempt to formulate an economically feasible plan
with the owner(s) of the site or structure for the preservation of the site or
structure. Unless the Commission is satisfied that the proposed construction,
alteration, or reconstruction will not materially impair the historic, archeological,
or architectural significance of the site or structure, the Commission shall reject
the application, filing a copy of its rejection with the Zoning Administrator.
(2) If an application is submitted for construction, reconstruction, or alteration, or for
the moving or demolition of a site or structure at that the Commission considers
IX-19
to be of unusual importance and no economically feasible plan can be formulated,
the Commission shall have ninety (90) days, from the time it concludes that no
economically feasible plan can be formulated, to negotiate with the owner and
other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the site or structure.
In the case of a site or structure considered to be valuable for its historic,
archeological, or architectural significance, for Commission may approve the
proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, moving, or demolition despite
the provisions of Section 6.2.d (1) above if:
(a) The site or structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program
which will be of substantial benefit to the Town;
(b) Retention of the site or structure would cause undue financial hardship to
the owner; or
(c) Retention of the site or structure would not be in the best interest of a
majority of persons in the Town.
3. Commission Decision. The Commission shall file with the Zoning Administrator a Historic
District Work Permit certifying its approval, modification, or rejection of each application and
plans submitted to it for review. Work shall not be commenced on any project until such a
permit has been filed, and the Zoning Administrator shall not issue a building or any other permit
for such change or construction unless it has received the Historic District Work Permit.
4. Routine Maintenance. Nothing in this Article shall be taken or construed to prevent
maintenance that does not alter the exterior fabric or features of a designated landmark, site, or
structure, customary farming operations, or landscaping which will have no material effect on
the historic, archeological, or architectural significance of a designated landmark, site, structure,
or district.
Section 7. Demolition by Neglect
1. In the event of demolition by neglect, the Commission may request the Zoning
Administrator to notify, in writing, the property owner of record, any person having a right,
title, or interest therein, and the occupant or other person responsible for the maintenance
of the property, of the deterioration. The notice shall specify the minimum items of repair
or maintenance necessary to correct the deterioration or prevent further deterioration.
2. Prior to the issuance of a written notice, the Commission may request the Zoning Administrator
to establish a record of demolition by neglect. Such a record may include dated materials such
as photographs and written reports of the condition of the property so as to record or measure
the deterioration.
3. The notice shall provide that corrective action shall commence within thirty (30) days of
the receipt of said notice and be completed within a reasonable time thereafter. The notice
shall state that the owner of record of the property, or any person of record with any right,
title, or interest therein, may, within ten (10) days after the receipt of the notice, request a
hearing on the necessity of the items and conditions contained in the notice. In the event
a public hearing is requested, it shall be held by the Commission upon thirty (30) days written
IX-20
notice being mailed to all persons of record with any right, title, or interest in the property and to
all citizens and organizations which the Commission determines may have an interest in the
proceedings.
4. If, after the public hearing, the Commission determines that the corrective actions remain
necessary, the Commission may request that the Zoning Adminstrator take corrective action to
comply with the Final Notice within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Final Notice.
5. Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of the property owner or other responsible person, duly
notified, to take the corrective action specified in the Final Notice within the time required,
the Commission may request that the Zoning Administrator institute any of the remedies and
penalties provided by law for such violations.
Section 8. Order to Restore
In the event that any type of intervention on a property or structure in the Historic District has been
conducted without a Historic District Work Permit or in violation of a Historic District Work
Permit , or, in cases of Demolition by Neglect, the Town may issue the owner an Order to Restore.
This order will require the property owner to restore the property to the condition that existed prior
to the intervention using material-in-kind and design-in-kind, subject to all applicable building and life
safety codes. The Historic District Commission shall review the intended mitigation of any such
intervention for appropriateness, and establish a reasonable time limit for the mitigation.
Section 9. Role of Maryland Historical Trust
The Commission may designate the Maryland Historical Trust to make an analysis of and report
recommending the preservation of sites, structures, or districts of historic, archeological, architectural, or
cultural significance within the Town. The report may include proposed boundaries of sites, structures,
or districts, as well as recommendations for the identification and designation of particular sites,
structures, or districts to be preserved.
Section 10. Appeals
In the event than any party is aggrieved by a decision of the Commission, the party has the right of
appeal to the Circuit Court for Cecil County. Appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days from the date of
Commission decision.
Section 11. Violations
Any willful violation of the provisions of this article shall be a violation of this Ordinance and subject

of the Americans with Disabilities Act;
(ii) Literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in
discrimination by virtue of such disability or deprive a disabled resident
or user of the reasonable use and enjoyment of the property;
(iii) A reasonable accommodation would reduce or eliminate the
discriminatory effect of the provisions of this Ordinance or restore the
disabled resident’s or user’s reasonable use or enjoyment of the property;
(iv) The accommodation requested will not substantially impair the purpose,
intent, or effect, of the provisions of this Ordinance as applied to the
property; and
(v) The accommodation would be environmentally neutral with no greater
negative impact on the environment than the literal enforcement of the
statute, ordinance, regulation or other requirement; or would allow only
the minimum environmental changes necessary to address the needs
resulting from the particular disability of the applicant/appellant.
(2) The Zoning Administrator shall determine the nature and scope of any
accommodation for disabled citizens under this Ordinance and may award
different or other relief than requested after giving due regard to the purpose,
intent, or effect of the applicable provisions of this Ordinance. The Zoning

ARTICLE X PERMISSIBLE USES
Section 1. Use of the Designations P, PC, SE and SC in the Table of Permissible Uses
When used in connection with a particular use in the Table of Permissible Uses, the letter "P" means that
the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator. When used
in connection with a particular use in the Table of Permissible Uses, the letter "PC" means that the use is
permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator provided the conditions
stipulated in Article XII are met. The letters "SC" mean the conditions of approval stipulated in Article
XII for the proposed use must be met and a special exception permit must be obtained from the Board of
Zoning Appeals. The letters "SE" mean a special exception permit must be obtained from the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
Section 2. Board of Appeals Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible With a Zoning
Permit
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of Permissible Uses (interpreted
in the light of the applicable provisions contained in this article) provides that a use in a nonresidential
zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit, a special-exception
permit shall nevertheless be required if the Administrator finds that the proposed use would have an
extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. In making this determination, the
administrator shall consider, among other factors, whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or
previously developed lot, whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use
classification to another, whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards
or difficulties, and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ
substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question.
Section 3. Permissible Uses and Specific Exclusions
1. The presumption established by this zoning ordinance is that all legitimate uses of land in the
Town are provided for within at least one zoning district in the Town's planning jurisdiction.
Because the list of permissible uses set forth in the Table of Permissible Uses cannot be all
inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have
similar impacts to the listed uses.
2. Notwithstanding Subsection 1., all uses that are not listed in the Table of Permissible Uses, even
given the liberal interpretation mandated by Subsection 1., are prohibited. Nor shall the Table of
Permissible Uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is
more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts.
3. No building or tract of land shall be devoted to any use other than a use permitted hereinafter in
the zoning district in which such building or tract of land shall be located, with the exception of
the following:
a. Uses lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance.
b. Special exceptions, recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the
Board of Appeals, in accordance with the provisions of Article IV, Part II of this
Ordinance.
c. Planned Unit Developments approved by the Town Commissioners, in accordance with
the provisions of Article XI of this Ordinance.
X-2
4. Uses lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance and rendered non-conforming by
the provisions thereof shall be subject to the regulations of Article VIII of this Ordinance.
5. The following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts:
a. Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any
highly combustible or explosive materials.
b. Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants.
c. Use of any vehicle or travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence.
d. Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from
which any goods are sold or stored, any services are performed, or other business is
conducted.
Section 4. Accessory Uses
1. The Table of Permissible Uses classifies different principal uses according to their different
impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in
this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use (1)
constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or
(2) is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use
may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella
of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is
customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multi-family
development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such
facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require a special-exception
permit.
2. The following activities, so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above, are
specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses:
a. “Non-commercial” offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an
occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on
administrative or artistic activities, so long as such activities do not fall within the
definition of a home occupation.
b. Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature.
c. The renting out of one or two rooms within a single-family residence (which one or two
rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit) to not more than two
persons who are not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling.
d. Yard sales or garage sales. See Chapter 5.20 of the Town Charter and Code.
3. The following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are
prohibited in residential districts.
a. Storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any motor vehicle that is neither
licensed nor operational.
X-3
Section 5. Change in Use
1. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the
activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:
a. The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.
b. If the original use is a combination use or planned unit development, the relative
proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the
combination use or planned unit development use, changes to such an extent that the
parking requirements for the overall use are altered.
c. If the original use is a combination use or planned unit development use, the mixture of
types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned unit
development use changes.
d. If the original use is a planned residential development, the relative proportions of
different types of dwelling units change.
e. If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that
business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use), that
business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though
the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or
combination use category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only
one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out
and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both
tenants fall within the same principal use classification. However, if the florist shop were
replaced by another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type
of business or enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved
out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that
would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and
the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center-combination
use) has not changed.
2. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not
constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the
two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the
property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than
180 consecutive days or has been abandoned.
3. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be
regarded as a change in use.
Section 6. Combination Uses
1. When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of
permits (zoning or special-exception), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:
a. A special-exception permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a specialexception
permit.
b. A zoning permit in all other cases.
X-4
2. When a combination use consists of a single-family detached residential subdivision that is not a
two-family or multi-family use, the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be
determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be
developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate
lot.
3. When a combination use consists of a single-family detached and two-family or multi-family
uses, then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area
of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit specified in Article XIII, Section 9.
Section 7. Permissible Uses Tables
1. More specific use controls. Whenever a development could fall within a more than one use
classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely and most
specifically describes the development controls.
2. Table of Permissible Uses (see following pages)

ARTICLE XI PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Section 1. Planned Unit Development (PUD)
1. Planned Unit Development in General.
It is the intent of this floating zone to control the placement, design, use, and density of well
planned, developments which will offer a variety of building types and a more efficient overall
use of land, and within these limits, permit variety in the design and management of such varying
types of residential and non-residential uses. The following objectives are sought for all PUD’s:
a. To provide a more attractive and varied environment than would be possible through the
strict application of existing zoning district requirements.
b. To encourage the conservation of natural features, preservation of open space and critical
and sensitive areas, and protection from natural hazards.
c. To provide for efficient use of public facilities.
d. To encourage a more intimate, efficient and aesthetic use of open space.
e. To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of land.
f. To encourage variety in the physical development pattern of residential areas.
g. To enhance the neighborhood character and create a pedestrian oriented environment
within each PUD.
h. To allow greater intensity and density developments while promoting a more desirable
living environment through the use of site and building design standards.
i. To encourage and preserve opportunities for energy-efficient development and
redevelopment.
j. To promote attractive and functional environments for non-residential uses that are
compatible with surrounding land use.
k. To encourage non-residential uses that serve primarily the region.
l. To properly address how a large size Planned Unit Development is created and built-out
to ensure cohesiveness in design and planning and encourage efficiency when the
development of a large number of dwelling units (in excess of 50 acres) is proposed.
2. The Mayor and Commissioners shall follow the procedures set forth in Article XIX of the Town
of Elkton Zoning Ordinance for the approval of a floating zone.
a. In addition to said procedures set forth in Article XIX, the procedures for the
establishment of the PUD floating zone and subsequent approval of development within
said PUD shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article.
b. Notice to Adjacent Property Owners. Applicant shall provide notice to all contiguous
property owners no less than ten (10) days and no more than thirty (30) days prior to a

Sections 6-10 as part of the Concept Plan application. Any modifications not expressly
disclosed in Applicant’s application shall not be deemed approved until proper
application and approval. In addition to the express inclusion of any modifications within
the proposed PUD Concept Plan, Applicant’s request for modifications shall include:
1. A statement contrasting the proposed modifications with the ordinance
requirements that would otherwise control;
2. A statement identifying the public benefits of the proposed modifications as
opposed to the development of the real property pursuant to the ordinance
requirements that would otherwise control;
3. A statement and exhibits as to how the proposed modifications are utilized in like
communities;
4. A statement identifying the existence of special conditions or circumstances, if
any, that are unique to the real property and would require a modification;
5. A statement identifying whether the requested modifications are (1) the result of
Applicant’s own actions; and/or (2) based upon conditions or circumstances
which are self-created or self-imposed; and
6. A statement identifying why strict enforcement of the provisions of the relevant
ordinance would be contrary to the public benefit.
b. Modifications shall not be granted solely on the grounds that a nearby rear property
parcel maintains a nonconforming use.
XI-4
c. Procedure:
1. If a PUD Concept Plan application with modifications accompanies a PUD
floating zone application, then, after a public hearing, the Planning Commission
shall inform the Mayor and Commissioners that it (1) approves the modifications
in whole or in part; (2) does not approve the modifications; and/or 3) approves
the modifications with conditions. The decision of the Planning Commission
shall be conditioned upon the Mayor and Commissioners approval of the PUD
floating zone application.
2. If a PUD Concept Plan application with modifications is submitted subsequent to
the approval of a PUD floating zone application, then, after a public hearing, the
Planning Commission may either (1) grant approval of the modifications in
whole or in part; (2) deny the modifications; and/or (3) grant the modifications
with conditions.
3. Any modifications requested subsequent to approval of a PUD Concept Plan
shall be resolved per the same process, and an Applicant shall not be denied a
modification solely because it was not requested within a PUD Concept Plan.
d. Conditions to Modifications:
1. Upon granting modification(s), the Planning Commission may:
a. Condition approval of any modifications on higher design standards;
b. Require any and all reasonable conditions it determines necessary to
preserve and ensure the public benefit; and
c. Impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the
property to which the modification applies will be as compatible as
practicable with the surrounding properties.
e. Standard of Review:
1. After a public hearing under oath and consideration of input and reports from
town departments and agents, the Planning Commission shall determine
whether the proposed modification(s), with any conditions, provide a
greater public benefit than strict adherence to the relevant ordinance(s) in
consideration of the totality of the PUD.
f. Any modifications requested within the Critical Area District shall be controlled by
Article V of the Town of Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
12. Sanitary Facilities – No PUD plan shall be approved unless the proposed development can be
served by public water and sewer disposal systems, which shall be existing or guaranteed by a
Public Works Agreement at the time the plan receives final approval. At the time of approving
any phase of the PUD for final plat approval, satisfactory evidence must be furnished to the
Planning Commission and the Town Commissioners that the existing Town sewer and water
system can handle the increased demand placed upon them by the proposed PUD and meet
current health department requirements for standards of operation.
13. A minimum of at least two of the following permitted housing types shall be provided in all
PUD’s – Single-family detached dwellings; single-family attached dwellings including
townhouses, two-family dwellings; and multi-family dwellings including apartments.
14. Residential Requirements.
a. At least fifty percent (50%) of the gross acreage of the PUD shall be a combination of
open space and residential uses.
b. At least sixty percent (60%) of the total dwelling units within a PUD shall be singlefamily
detached dwellings, condominiums, and/or senior housing units.
XI-5
c. No permits may be issued for the construction of non-residential uses until such time as
twenty percent (20%) of the proposed residential lots within the PUD have been
approved and recorded with the Cecil County Land Records.
1. If it is determined that good cause exists to do so, the Mayor and Commissioners
may waive or relax this requirement upon a request made by the Applicant at the
time of the application for a PUD Floating Zone.
d. Any Final Site Plan shall include a note that “There shall be no residential rental
properties other than managed commercial apartments.” Upon final approval and filing
of any Subdivision approvals, Deed Restrictions shall be filed which include the same
provision.
15. Common Open Space Requirements.
a. Shall comprise not less than twenty-five (25) percent of the gross acreage for the PUD.
b. All open space shall be designated for the common use of all occupants of the PUD.
c. There shall be .02 acres allotted per dwelling to be designated as parks and recreational
areas (e.g. Public parks, dog parks, improved ADA accessible trails, tot lots, etc.).
However, the parks and recreational areas shall comprise not less than thirty percent
(30%) of the common open space.
d. In designing and locating the required open space, each common open space area should
be connected to another existing or proposed open space area, to the greatest extent
possible, with the intent of establishing a network of usable open space.
e. Recreational facilities and open space requirements are specified in Article XIV –
Recreational Facilities & Open Space of the Town of Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
16. Architectural Design Standards
a. PUD architecture should demonstrate the cohesive planning of the development and
present a clearly identifiable design feature throughout. It is not intended that buildings
be totally uniform in appearance or that designers and developers by restricted in their
creativity. Rather, cohesion and identity can be demonstrated in similar building scale or
mass; consistent use of façade materials; similar ground-level detailing, color or signage;
consistency in functional systems, such as roadway or pedestrian way surfaces, signage,
or landscaping; the framing of outdoor open space and linkages, or a clear conveyance in
the importance of various buildings and features on the site.
b. All structures shall be designed to comply with the following requirements:
1. The architectural features, materials, and the articulation of a façade of a building
shall be continued on all sides visible from and directly abutting a public street.
2. The front façade of the principal building on any lot shall face onto a public
street.
3. The front façade of any residential structure shall not be oriented to face directly
toward a parking lot, unless that parking lot serves the residential structure (i.e., multifamily
building).
4. A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to give
each building or group of buildings a distinct character.
c. All residential structures shall be designed to comply with the following requirements:
1. The same front façade for single-family detached residential units shall not be
repeated more than five (5) times within one (1) block face for both sides of any
street and shall be separated by at least two (2) lots with different façades. To the
greatest extent possible, houses with the same front façade should not be located
across the street from each other. One (1) and two (2) story units should be
intermixed in each block face. Front loaded units should randomly alter the
location of the driveway on the left and right sides of the façade.
XI-6
2. Architectural styles and floor plans should vary throughout the development and
special attention shall be given to the appearance and scale of housing as it
relates to the street. House façades shall be varied and articulated to provide
visual interest to pedestrians along the street frontage. In no case should more
than fifty (50) percent of the front façade of a house consist of an unarticulated
block wall.
3. Attached dwelling units shall include primary entrances that are visible and
accessible from the street and shall have a pedestrian path or walkway from the
primary entrance to the sidewalk.
4. Porches, pent roofs, roof overhands, hooded front doors or other similar
architectural elements shall define the front entrance to all residences.
5. Attached dwelling units containing more than 2 units in a row shall have façades
which alternate siding styles and patterns to provide visual distinction to each
unit. Alteration between siding, brick, and/or stone is permitted and encouraged.
6. The façades of attached dwelling units containing more than two units in a row
shall be offset by at least 2 feet per unit in order to provide architectural relief.
7. Single Family Attached Dwellings. No more than 20% of attached dwellings can
be no more than 6 in a row. No more than 20% of attached dwellings can be no
more than 5 in a row and the remaining dwellings can be no more than 4 in a
row.
8. At least four (4) of the following architectural details shall be used to articulate a
building’s façade:
a. Transoms and unique window forms,
b. Special window, such as mullioned, and door surrounds,

h. Porches,
i. Covered entries,
j. Porticos,
k. Protruding eaves,
l. Window shutters,
m. Recesses and bays,
n. Balcony or balconett,
o. Use of multiple roof and porch planes,
p. Hip, gable or gambrel roofs, unless another roof type is consistent with
the architectural style,
q. Variations in color and avoiding the same principal color on houses next
to each other, or
r. Variation in floor plan, entryway location and building placement on
each block.
d. All non-residential and mixed-use structures shall be designed to comply with the
following requirements:
1. Non-residential buildings shall be designed with an architectural style and/or
theme. The intent of this guideline is to ensure that non-residential development
incorporates architecturally valid design of each building and architectural
compatibility within an integrated development. Not all building elevations of a
structure will have the same level of detailing and articulation in order to avoid
monotony.
XI-7
2. The design of all buildings shall employ textured surfaces, projections, recesses,
color, window patterns, overhangs, reveals, changes in parapet heights, and
similar architectural devices to avoid monolithic shapes and surfaces and to
emphasize building entries. Designs shall avoid the use of long, unbroken, flat
walls.
3. Building façades shall also include a repeating pattern of one or more of the
following design elements/features:
a. Variations in color
b. Variations in texture
c. Change in relief
d. Material module change
4. Design building entries and street side façades with elements that enhance
pedestrian comfort and orientation while presenting features with visual interest
that invite activity;
5. At least sixty (60) percent of the total street frontage ground floor length of any
new or reconstructed building shall be differentiated architecturally by recessed
windows and entries, display windows, offset surfaces, differentiated piers and
columns, offset planes, textured materials, awnings, or other details or displays of
interest to pedestrians.
6. Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible
customer entrances featuring one or more of the following:
a. Canopies or porticos
b. Overhangs
c. Recesses/projections
d. Arcades
e. Raised corniced parapets over the door
f. Peaked roof forms
g. Arches
h. Display windows
i. Architectural details such as tile work, moldings, stone or brick
integrated into the building structure and design
j. Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or
places for sitting
k. Special paving patterns and materials
l. Entry recessed a minimum of three feet when accessed from the public
right-of-way
7. Designs that emphasize floor lines or that express rhythms and patterns of
windows, columns, cornices, dormers, and other architectural features are
encouraged.
8. Building components such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets shall be
proportionate to one another, compatible in size and design.
9. A minimum of fifty percent of the building frontage width above the first story
shall be differentiated by recessed windows, balconies, offset planes, or other
architectural details that provide dimensional relief.
10. Roof Forms and Materials for commercial buildings.
a. Avoid rooflines running in continuous planes wherever appropriate.
b. Partial mansard roofs, and pitched roofs that do not reach a true peak or
hip should be avoided.

greater than the average depth of said existing front yards, but shall be at least ten (10)
feet. In no event shall any building be constructed closer than any setback established on
a plat of record.

restrictive yard requirements.
6. Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to a point
on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building that is
substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a flagpole, etc.).

yards:
a. Accessory buildings shall be prohibited in any required front yard or side street side yard.
b. Accessory buildings shall be distant at least five (5) feet from rear lot boundary lines.
c. Where an accessory building is located in a district requiring a side yard and such
building is entirely to the rear of the principal structure, the accessory building shall be
located at least five (5) feet from any side or rear lot line. Where an accessory building is
located in a district not requiring a side yard, the accessory building shall be located at
least three (3) feet from the side lot line.
d. Where any portion of an accessory building projects between a principal structure and the
side lot line, the accessory building shall comply with the required side yard restriction
for a principal structure on that lot.
e. Where a corner lot adjoins in the rear a lot in any residential zone, no part of an accessory
building within twenty-five (25) feet of the common lot line shall extend closer to street
than the actual or required (whichever is less) depth of the front yard for the principal
structure on adjoining lot.
2. Accessory buildings shall not exceed the maximum height restriction for the zone in which they
are located nor shall they exceed the height of the principal structure on the lot.

ARTICLE XIV COMMON OPEN SPACE AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS
Section 1. Provision of Common Open Space
The minimum common open space that shall be provided is as specified in Article XIII, Section 9. Open
space (spaces designed and intended for the use and enjoyment of all residents of the development) may
contain such complimentary structures, improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the use,
benefit and enjoyment of residents of the development. Common open space areas shall meet the
following requirements:
1. Common open space areas shall be exclusive of non-tidal or tidal wetlands, road rights-of-way
and parking areas.
2. Common open space may serve recreational purposes, preserve significant site features, and
preserve open space. The uses authorized shall be appropriate to the purposes intended to be
served. Open space designed to serve recreational purposes shall be appropriate to the scale and
character of the development, considering its size, density, expected population, and the number
and type of dwelling units proposed.
3. Common open space will be suitably improved for its intended use, except that common open
space containing natural features worthy of protection may be left unimproved. The buildings,
structures, and improvements to be permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to
the uses which are authorized for the common space.
Section 2. Neighborhood Parks Required
In order to implement the Community Facility Goals and Objectives of the Comprehensive Plan,
neighborhood parks shall be required for all new residential development in accordance with the
following requirements:
1. For developments up to 100 dwelling units, .005 acres/dwelling unit shall be required.
2. For developments over 100 dwelling units, .015 acres/dwelling unit shall be required.
3. Except as provided below, it is the intent of this section that the required land area for
neighborhood parks is in addition to the open space required in Section 1. above.
4. In the case of apartment developments, the requirement, as stated in Article XII, Section 29.2 of
this Ordinance that 25% of the required 30% open space be suitable for usable recreational, said
25% shall satisfy the neighborhood park requirement of this Section.
Section 3. Neighborhood Parks: Purpose and Standards
1. The purpose of the neighborhood park is to provide adequate active recreational facilities to serve
the residents of the immediately surrounding neighborhood within the development. The
following are illustrative of the types of facilities that shall be deemed to serve active recreational
needs and therefore to count toward satisfaction of the neighborhood park requirements of this
article: tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, sauna and exercise rooms, meeting or
activity rooms within clubhouses, basketball courts, swings, slides, and play apparatus.
XIV-2
2. Each development shall satisfy its neighborhood park requirement by installing the types of
recreational facilities that are most likely to be suited to and used by the age bracket of persons
likely to reside in that development. However, unless it appears that less than 5 percent of the
residents of any development are likely to be children under 12, then at least 15 percent of the
neighborhood park must be satisfied by the construction of "tot lots" (i.e., areas equipped with
imaginative play apparatus oriented to younger children as well as seating accommodations for
parents).
3. Neighborhood parks shall be attractively landscaped and shall be provided with sufficient natural
or man-made screening or buffer areas to minimize any negative impacts upon adjacent
residences.
4. Each neighborhood park shall be centrally located and easily accessible so that it can be
conveniently and safely reached and used by those persons in the surrounding neighborhood it is
designed to serve. For neighborhood parks to be dedicated to the Town (see Section 5 below),
said park shall have frontage on, or fee-simple access to, a public street. Said access shall be of
suitable configuration to allow for regular maintenance by the Town and access by the general
public.
5. Neighborhood parks shall not be less than 5000 square feet in size.
6. Each neighborhood park shall be constructed on land, the final grade of which shall not exceed a
five percent (5%) slope, that is free of nontidal wetlands, and capable of serving the purposes
intended by this article.
Section 4. Open Space/Neighborhood Park – Ownership and Management
1. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the required common open space and neighborhood park for
residential subdivisions be dedicated to the Town of Elkton and be available for public use. Said
dedication shall be at the sole discretion of the Town.
2. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the required common open space and neighborhood park for
apartment developments not be dedicated to the Town of Elkton and be privately maintained in
accordance with subsection 3. Below.
3. Where the Town determines that it is not in the best interest of the Town to accept dedication of
the required open space and neighborhood park (such as in apartment developments), the
Planning Commission shall require legal arrangements sufficient to assure their maintenance and
preservation for whatever purpose they are intended. Instruments in the form of deed restrictions
and/or covenant shall be provided to insure the purpose for which the open space is provided will
be achieved. Said instruments shall be approved by the Planning Commission prior to recordation
among the Land Records of Cecil County.
Section 5. Financial Surety for Improvements
Prior to final approval of the development plan where common open space and neighborhood parks are
required, the developer shall submit a financial surety in the form of a Public Works Agreement
acceptable to the Town in an amount as specified by the Town, which surety shall secure an agreement to
construct the required physical improvements such as but not limited to landscaping, play equipment and
athletic field construction as identified on the approved plans.
XIV-3
Section 6. Flexibility in Administration Authorized
1. The requirements set forth in this article concerning the size, location, nature and amount of
common open space and the required neighborhood parks within residential developments are
established by the Town as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that
amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially adopted Town
plans. The Town recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the
nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of this
article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical
precision. Therefore, the Planning Commission may permit minor deviations from these
standards whenever it determines that: (1) the objectives underlying these standards can be met
without strict adherence to them; and (2) because of peculiarities in the developer's tract of land
or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards.
2. Whenever the Planning Commission authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in
this article pursuant to Subsection 1., the official record of action taken on the development shall
contain a statement of reasons for allowing the deviation.
Section 7. Reserved
XV-1
ARTICLE XV UTILITIES
Section 1. Utility Ownership and Easement Rights
In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of water, sewer, electrical power,
telephone, or cable television facilities and intends that such facilities shall be owned, operated, or
maintained by a public utility or any entity other than the developer, the developer shall transfer to such
utility or entity the necessary ownership or easement rights to enable the utility or entity to operate and
maintain such facilities.
Section 2. Underground Utilities
1. All electric power lines (not to include transformers or enclosures containing electrical equipment
including, but not limited to, switches, meters, or capacitors which may be pad mounted),
telephone, gas distribution, and cable television lines in subdivisions constructed after the
effective date of this Ordinance shall be placed underground in accordance with the specifications
and policies of the respective utility service providers.
2. Whenever an unsubdivided development is hereafter constructed on a lot that is undeveloped on
the effective date of this ordinance, then all electric power, telephone, gas distribution, and cable
television lines installed to serve the development that are located on the development site outside
of a previously existing public street right-of-way shall be placed underground in accordance with
the specifications and policies of the respective utility companies.
Section 3. Utilities To Be Consistent With Internal and External Development
1. Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one development
will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby developments, such utility facilities (e.g., water
or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be made conveniently and
without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service.
2. All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize interference with
pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue damage to
improvements or facilities located within the development.
Section 4. Electric Service
Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a source of electric power
adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such subdivision.
Compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows:
1. If the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing power line and
the use can be served by a simple connection to such power line (as opposed to a more complex
distribution system, such as would be required in an apartment complex or shopping center), then
no further certification is needed.
2. If the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing power line or a
substantial internal distribution system will be necessary, then the electric utility service provider
must review the proposed plans and certify to the Town that it can provide service that is
adequate to meet the needs of the proposed use and every lot within the proposed subdivision.
XV-2
Section 5. Lighting Requirements
1. All entrances and exits in substantial buildings used for nonresidential purposes and in twofamily
or multi-family residential developments containing more than four (4) dwelling units
shall be adequately lighted to ensure the safety of persons and the security of the buildings.
2. Excessive Illumination. Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot and
substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of such other lot is prohibited. Lighting
unnecessarily illuminates another lot when it substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of
neighboring properties.
Section 6. Lighting Standards
1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the spill-over of light and glare on operators of
motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses in the proximity of the light source. With respect to
motor vehicles in particular, safety considerations are the basis of the regulations contained
herein. In other cases, both the nuisance and hazard aspects of glare are regulated. This section is
not intended to apply to public street lighting.
2. Site lighting shall be of low-intensity from a concealed source and shall not spill over into
adjoining properties, buffers, roadways, or in any way interfere with the vision of oncoming
motorists.
3. Exemption for specified outdoor recreational uses. Because of their unique requirements for
nighttime visibility and their limited hours of operation, ball diamonds, playing fields, and tennis
courts are exempted from the exterior lighting standards of Subsection 2. above upon satisfying
the Planning Commission during a site plan review that the site plan indicates that these outdoor
recreational uses meet all other requirements of this section and of this Ordinance and the
following conditions:
a. The outdoor recreational uses specified above shall not exceed a maximum permitted
post height of forty (40) feet.
b. The outdoor recreational uses specified above may exceed a total cutoff angle of ninety
(90) degrees, provided that the luminaire is shielded in either its orientation or by a
landscaped bufferyard to prevent light and glare spill-over to adjacent residential
property. The maximum permitted illumination at the interior bufferyard line shall not
exceed two (2) footcandles.
4. Additional regulations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary:
a. No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted.
b. Light sources or luminaires shall not be located within bufferyard areas except on
pedestrian walkways.
5. Exterior lighting plan. At the time any exterior light is installed or substantially modified, and
whenever a zoning certificate is sought, an exterior lighting plan shall be submitted to the Town
in order to determine whether the requirements of this section have been met and that adjoining
property will not be adversely impacted by the proposed lighting.
XV-3
Section 7. Sites For and Screening of Dumpsters
1. Every new development constructed from the effective date of this ordinance that is or will be
required to provide one or more dumpsters for solid waste collection shall provide sites for such
dumpsters that are:
a. Located so as to facilitate collection and minimize any negative impact on persons
occupying the development site, neighboring properties, or public rights-of-way, and
b. Constructed according to specifications established by the Town to allow for collection
without damage to the development site or the collection vehicle.
2. All such dumpsters shall be screened if and to the extent that, in the absence of screening, they
would be clearly visible to:
a. Persons located within any dwelling unit on residential property other than that where the
dumpster is located.
b. Occupants, customers, or employees located within any building on nonresidential
property other than that where the dumpster is located.
c. Persons travelling on any public street, sidewalk, or other public way.
3. When dumpster screening is required under this section, such screening shall be constructed,
installed, and located to prevent or remedy the conditions requiring the screening.

Section 2. Number of Parking Spaces Required
1. All developments in all zoning districts shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to
accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development
in question.
2. The presumptions established by this article are that: (1) a development must comply with the
parking standards set forth in Subsection 5. to satisfy the requirement stated in Subsection 1., and
(2) any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, the Table of
Minimum Parking Requirements is only intended to establish a presumption and should be
flexibly administered, as provided in Section 3 of this Part.
3. All off-street parking spaces required to serve buildings or a use erected or established after the
effective date of this Ordinance shall be located on the same zoning lot as the building or use
served, except that where an increase in the number of spaces is required by a change or
enlargement of a non-residential use or where spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by
two (2) or more non-residential buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be located
and maintained as set forth in Sections 3, 8, and 9, of this Part.
4. The Town recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements set forth in Subsection 5. cannot
and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically
covered, the Town is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table as a guide.

When determination of the number of parking spaces required results in a requirement fractional
space, any fraction shall be counted as one parking space.
6. Parking lots for shared or community uses are encouraged, as set forth in Sections 8 and Section 9
of this Part.
XVII-5
7. For uses in the TC District, no more than 120 percent of the required minimum number of
parking spaces is permitted.
Section 3. Flexibility in Administration Required
1. The Town of Elkton recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the
inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Section 2.5. of this Part, may result in a
development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs.
Alternative off-street parking standards may be accepted if the applicant can demonstrate that
such standards better reflect local conditions and needs.
2. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow
deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Section 2.5. of this Part when it finds that:
a. A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly;
b. A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.
3. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the parking
requirements set forth in Section 2.5. of this Part, it shall enter on the face of the permit the
parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.
4. If the Town concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific
development proposal, that the presumption established by Section 2.5. of this Part, for a
particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table
of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XIX.
5. Parking Reduction. In the TC District, the Planning Commission may approve a reduction in the
required number of spaces for each use as follows:
a. Up to twenty-five (25) percent if the use is located within 400 feet walking distance from
a public parking facility.
b. Up to five (5) percent if the use is within 400 feet of a transit facility.
c. Reduced on-site parking as determined through a shared parking study per Section 8 of
this Part.
d. One parking space for each on-street parking space that is provided directly along the
building frontage, which is intended for customers or residents, not for employees or
business owners.
e. Each parking space approved by the Maryland Energy Administration for use as an
electric vehicle charging station shall count as two (2) spaces toward meeting the
minimum number of parking spaces required for a maximum of five percent of the
required parking.
f. Up to five (5) percent if Class I bicycle storage racks are provided for twenty-five (25)
percent of the total number of projected employees and residential units, and up to ten
XVII-6
(10) percent if Class I racks for fifty (50) percent of the total of number employees and
residential units are provided.
Section 4. Parking Space Dimensions
1. Subject to Subsections 2. and 3., each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least
eighteen (18) feet long and nine (9) feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at
various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain
within them the rectangular area required by this section.
2. Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such
parking spaces shall be not less than twenty-three (23) feet by nine (9) feet.
3. Each handicapped parking space shall meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities
Act. (See Section 12 of this Part also.)
Section 5. Required Widths of Parking area Aisles and Driveways
1. Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table, which varies the width
requirement according to the angle of parking.

2. Driveways shall be not less than 10 feet or exceed 15 feet in width for one-way traffic and not
less than 18 feet or exceed 30 feet in width for two-way traffic, except that 10-feet-wide
driveways are permissible for two-way traffic when (a) the driveway is not longer than 50 feet,
(b) it provides access to not more than 6 spaces, and (c) sufficient turning space is provided so
that vehicles need not back into a public street.
Section 6. General Design Requirements
1. Unless no other practicable alternative is available vehicle accommodation areas shall be
designed so that, without resorting to extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas
without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting
of driveways that serve one or two dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets is
discouraged.
2. Vehicle accommodation areas of all development shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency,
and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing
unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements.
3. Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the
perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be
designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any
wall, vegetation, or other obstruction. In a residential zone, the driveway should be a minimum
XVII-7
of either twenty feet by twenty feet (20’x 20’), or ten feet by forty feet (10’ x 40’). Garages
cannot be counted as parking space.
4. Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to
pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.
5. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be arranged so as to reflect away
from any adjoining residential zone or uses and any public or private right-of-way.
6. A "sight triangle" shall be observed within a triangle formed by the intersection of the street lines
and points on the street line twenty-five (25) feet from the intersection at all street intersection or
intersections of driveways with streets.
7. All parking areas shall be drained so as to dispose of all surface water within the parking area
without carrying the said water accumulation over a public sidewalk.
8. No required off-street parking space in any residential zone shall be located within any required
front yard or side street side yard area except that parking in driveways for two (2) spaces is
permitted.
9. Additional parking in residential zones: Provided the above parking (Subsection 8) has been met,
additional parking shall be permitted in the required front yards or side street side yard, provided
the following setback requirements are met:
Side Street
Zone
Front Yard Setback
Side Yard Setback
RP
15'
8'
R-1
15'
8'
R-2
10'
4'
10. The percentage of coverage of permitted parking areas and driveways in any residential zone
shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the total required front yard or side street side yard.
11. For uses located in all zoning districts other than the TC District, off-street parking facilities may
be located within the required front yard of any commercial, office/residential, or industrial zone,
but shall not be nearer than fifty (50) feet to any residential district.
12. Special access, surface, and location requirements for garages, parking lots, automobile service
stations, and vehicle sales lots:
a. No building, structure or premises shall be used, erected, or altered which is intended or
designed to be used as a community garage, an automobile repair shop, a service station,
or a parking lot or structure as the principal use on a property, which has an entrance or
exit for vehicles in the same block front and within two hundred (200) feet of the
property boundary of any school, public playground, church, hospital, public library,
convalescent, nursing, or rest home, orphanage, and no such entrance or exit, except for a
community garage, shall be located within twenty (20) feet of any residential zone; nor
shall any structure used for an automobile repair shop or service station or any part of a
parking lot or structure be located within one hundred (100) feet of any property
boundary line of any of the aforesaid public or institutional uses. "Parking lot" or
XVII-8
“Parking Garage” as used herein does not include off-street parking areas as otherwise
required for the public or institutional uses listed above. This part shall not apply to any
parking garage serving transit operations (e.g. bus or rail service).
b. No gasoline pump, oil draining pit, or similar appliance for any purpose shall be located
within fifteen (15) feet of any right-of-way or within fifty (50) feet of a residential zone,
except where such a pump, pit, or appliance is within a completely enclosed building and
distant at least fifteen (15) feet from any shall be permitted as an accessory use for
another activity unless a site plan is submitted to and approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
13. Pedestrian Access. Safe provisions for pedestrian access to and through a parking lot shall be
required. Pedestrian walkways through the parking lot shall connect to sidewalks along public
streets.
Section 7. Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces
1. Vehicle accommodation areas as defined herein shall be graded and surfaced with portland
cement, bituminous concrete or pervious pavers.
a. Asphalt shall be of two inches of Type C hot mix over a four-inch graded aggregate base
course. An alternative design may be proposed by the applicant that is supplemented with
a subsurface investigation report prepared by a professional engineer. The alternative
design shall be reviewed and accepted by the Town Engineer.
b. Concrete or pervious pavers designs shall be reviewed and accepted by the Town
Engineer.
2. Parking spaces shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings.
3. Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In particular, and
without limiting the foregoing, vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good
XVII-9
condition (free from potholes, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly
visible and distinct.
4. The maximum permitted slope on driveways shall be ten (10) percent.
5. Driveways shall have a minimum width of 10 feet and a maximum width as approved on a case
by case basis, as reviewed by the Town Engineer and approved by the Planning Commission.
Section 8. Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces
1. One parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as otherwise
provided in this section, the required space assigned to one use may not be credited to any other
use.
2. If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves satellite
parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 9 of this Part, are also applicable.
3. In the case of mixed uses (with different parking requirements occupying the same building or
premises) or in the case of a joint use of a building or premises by more than one use having the
same parking requirements, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements
of the various uses computed separately
4. Off-street parking areas required for residential use shall not be included in any joint parking
arrangement, with the exception of shared parking facilities in the TC Town Center District.
5. The Planning Commission may authorize a reduction in the number of required parking spaces
for mixed use developments or for uses that are located near one another and which have different
peak parking demands and operating hours. A shared parking study acceptable to the Town
Engineer shall be submitted and include, at a minimum, the following:
a. Clearly establishes that the uses will use the shared spaces at different times of the day,
week, month or year.
b. Address the size and type of activities, the composition of tenants, the rate of turnover for
proposed shared spaces, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads.
c. Be based on the Urban Land Institute's methodology for determining shared parking, or
other generally accepted methodology, or calculated according to the following formula:
(1) Calculate the minimum amount of parking required for each land use as if it were
a separate use.
(2) To determine peak parking requirements, multiply the minimum parking required
for each proposed land use by the corresponding percentage in the table below
for each of the six time periods.
(3) Calculate the column total for each of the six time periods.
(4) The column (time period) with the highest value shall be the minimum parking
requirement.
XVII-10
d. Provide for no reduction in the number of required handicapped spaces,
e. Be approved by the Planning Commission and Town Engineer as part of the Site Plan or
Subdivision Plan approval, based on the feasibility of the users to share parking due to
their particular peak parking and trip generation characteristics.
f. An agreement for satellite or shared parking plan is executed between multiple users as
set forth in Section 9.7 of this Part.

Section 9. Satellite Parking
1. If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance cannot reasonably be
provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located,
then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this
section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as satellite parking spaces.
2. All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located
within four hundred (400) feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use
associated with such parking, or within four hundred (400) feet of the lot on which the use
associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building.
Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable
distance. Parking spaces for deliveries and loading and for uses oriented to emergency services as
well as the elderly shall be located within one hundred (100) feet of a public entrance of a
principal building housing the use associated with such parking. For uses located in all zoning
districts other than the TC District, no more than forty (40) percent of the total required spaces are
to be located in satellite parking spaces.
3. Satellite parking spaces shall be used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles. No
commercial repair work or service of any kind shall be conducted, and no charge shall be made
for parking. No sign of any kind, other than designating ownership, entrances, exits, and
conditions of use, shall be maintained on such satellite parking areas.
4. Each entrance and exit to and from such parking area shall be at least twenty (20) feet distant
from any adjacent lot line located in any residential zone.
5. The satellite parking areas shall be subject to all requirements of this ordinance concerning
surfacing, lighting, drainage, landscaping, screening, and setbacks.
XVII-11
6. The Planning Commission shall make finding that a safe, convenient and adequate pedestrian
connection, existing or planned, is located between the use and the satellite parking spaces.
7. Agreement for satellite or shared parking plan. A shared parking agreement allows users an
opportunity, if they choose, to redesign parking lots to be more efficient in serving multiple users.
This may consist of making new curb cuts between parking lots, restriping lots, or redesigning
internal traffic circulation and pedestrian walkways. A shared parking plan shall be enforced
through written agreement. To the extent the shared parking plan implements requirements of
this Ordinance an attested copy of the agreement between the owners’ of record and the Town
shall be submitted to the Town for review and approval by the Planning Commission. The
agreement shall be recorded in the County Office of Land Records by the owners’ of record prior
to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Proof of recordation of the agreement shall be presented
to the Director of Planning prior to certification. The agreement shall:
a. List the names and ownership interest of all parties to the agreement and contain the
signatures of those parties;
b. Provide a legal description of the land;
c. Include a site plan showing the area of the parking parcel;
d. Describe the area of the parking parcel and designate and reserve it for satellite or shared
parking unencumbered by any conditions which would interfere with its use;
e. Agree and expressly declare the intent for the covenant to run with the land and bind all
parties and all successors in interest to the covenant;
f. Assure the continued availability of the spaces and provide assurance that all spaces will
be usable without charge to all participating uses;
g. Describe the obligations of each party, including the maintenance responsibility to retain;
h. Incorporate the shared parking study by reference;
i. Be made part of the Site Plan/Final Subdivision Plan;
j. Describe the method by which the covenant shall, if necessary, be revised;
k. Change in use. Should any of the satellite or shared parking uses be changed, or should
the Planning Commission find that any of the conditions described in the approved
shared parking study or agreement no longer exist, the owner of record shall have the
option of submitting a revised shared parking study in accordance with the standards of
this section or of providing the number of spaces required for each use as if computed
separately.
Section 10. Special Provisions For Lots With Existing Buildings
1. Any increase in the intensity of use of any structure shall mean the addition of dwelling units,
employees, gross floor area, seating capacity, or any other unit of measurement used as a basis for
determining required parking facilities. When the intensity of use of any structure is increased by
less than twenty (20) percent, parking facilities shall be provided for the increase, but not for any
XVII-12
existing deficiency in such facilities. When the intensity is increased by more than twenty (20)
percent, including consecutive increases from the date of this Ordinance, parking facilities shall
be provided for the entire structure on premises.
2. When the use of any structure or premises is changed to a different use, parking facilities shall be
provided for the different use.
3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, whenever (a) there exists a lot with one
or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this ordinance, and (b) a change in
use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (c) the
parking requirements of Section 2 of this Part that would be applicable as a result of the proposed
change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that
can practicably be used for parking, then the developer need only comply with the requirements
of Section 2 of this Part to the extent the (a) parking space is practicably available on the lot
where the development is located, and (b) satellite parking space is reasonably available as
provided in Section 9 of this Part. However, if additional satellite parking subsequently becomes
reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing
development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become
available.
Section 11. Loading and Unloading Areas
1. Subject to Subsection 5., whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods,
merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a
sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section
to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner.
2. The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types
of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in question. The
following table indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard
set forth in this subsection. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more or less
loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard.

3. Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use
them can (a) maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and (b)
complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public
right-of-way or any parking space or parking lot aisle.
4. No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements
for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking are be used to satisfy the area
requirements for loading and unloading facilities.
5. Whenever (a) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective
date of this ordinance, and (b) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a
structure is proposed for such lot, and (c) the loading area requirements of this section cannot be
satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for
loading and unloading, then the developer need only comply with this section to the extent
reasonably possible.
6. No such space shall be located closer than fifty (50) feet to any other lot in any residential district
unless wholly within a completely enclosed building or unless enclosed on all sides by a wall or
uniformly painted board fence not less than six (6) feet in height.
Section 12. Parking Facilities for the Physically Handicapped
1. Parking for the physically handicapped shall be designed and provided in accordance with the
American with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines’ requirements for Parking and Passenger
Loading Zones as may be amended and shall be provided as follows:
XVII-14
Section 13. Town Center District Parking and Access Design Standards
1. The following requirements shall apply to all new development and redevelopment in the TC
Zone that is subject to the requirements of this Article:
a. Location of Parking Lots:
(1) All off-street parking spaces shall be located to the side or rear of the principal
structure occupying a lot. No parking shall be permitted between the building
and the public street front, with the exception of parallel on-street parking.
(2) Parking lots shall be set back 5 feet from the sidewalk.
(3) Parking lots shall not be permitted on corner lots that are located on collector or
arterial roads.
b. General Design Standards

available or can be created.
XVII-15
(2) Existing driveways shall be narrowed to the maximum extent possible.
(3) Existing curb cuts that are no longer needed shall be sealed-off and replaced with
curbing and sidewalks as approved by the Town Engineer.
(4) Whenever there is an existing curb cut, the sidewalk material (concrete, brick,
etc.) and design shall be extended to promote pedestrian continuity along the
sidewalk.
(5) Shared driveways through agreements between adjoining property owners are
hereby encouraged and shall be subject to Town approval.
(6) Wherever possible, ingress and egress between various properties shall be shared
in an attempt to minimize curb cuts. The Town encourages adjacent landowners
to enter into agreements providing access easements to accomplish this goal.
(7) Curbing or wheel stops shall be located to prevent any part of the vehicle from
overhanging the street right-of-way, property lines or internal sidewalks. Parking
and loading spaces shall not be an extension of any street right-of-way.
(8) Off-street surface parking shall not extend more than 70 feet in width along any
pedestrian street frontage without an urban garden, plaza, square, courtyard, or

“share the road” MUTCD-approved signage shall be installed.
b. Bicycle storage racks, or bicycle stands, shall be reserved for the particular use of the
structure for which they are required.
c. Class II bicycle storage racks shall be installed to accommodate a minimum of six (6)
bicycles or one (1) bicycle for every fifteen (15) auto parking spaces required for the use,
whichever is greater, with a maximum of thirty (30) bicycle spaces required.
Part II Landscaping of Parking Facilities
Section 1. Intent
1. It is intended that the application of the landscape standards set forth below will reduce the visual
and environmental impacts of large expanses of parking areas. Breaking up of paved parking
areas with plantings will provide improved aesthetics and micro-climatic benefits by reducing
heat and glare.
Section 2. Sites Affected
1. New sites. No new parking areas shall hereafter be constructed or used unless landscaping is
provided as required by the provision of this Article.
2. Existing sites. No parking areas shall be expanded, moved, or removed and/or reconstructed
unless the minimum landscaping required by the provision of this Article is provided for the
property to the extent of its alteration or expansion, but not for the entire property.
3. Change of use. No use shall be changed to another use for which the Zoning Ordinance requires
additional parking over and above that required for the previous use, unless vehicular use area
perimeter landscaping as required by this Article is provided for such additional parking. The
provisions of this section shall be effective regardless of whether or not new construction is
necessary to meet the parking requirements for the new uses. Where new construction will not be
necessary to meet the parking requirements, such additional required parking shall be deemed to
be on the perimeter for as much as possible of the existing vehicular use area. Where the previous
use had no required parking, perimeter landscaping shall be provided for the entire vehicular use
area serving the new use. Interior landscaping shall not be required where only the use of the
property is changed and no new construction or reconstruction is proposed.
4. Change of zone. No use of an existing building, structure, or vehicular use area shall be
commenced subsequent to a change in zoning unless property perimeter landscaping as required
herein has been provided.
Section 3. Perimeter Landscaping
XVII-17
1. Property line landscape buffers between adjacent land uses shall be provided in accordance to the
requirements spelled out in the landscape and land use buffer article of this ordinance.
2. Any parking lot that is adjacent to a road or public right-of-way shall provide a landscaping area
width based upon the following right-of-way width:
60 feet wide or less: 10 foot minimum landscape area width
More than 60 feet wide: 15 foot minimum landscape area width.
3. The Planning Commission may allow deviations from this requirement when it finds that the site
in question exhibits irregular, confining, or otherwise unusual characteristics. In no case shall the
required landscape area width be less than five (5) feet.
4. Where the pavement width of the parking lot exceeds sixty (60) feet, the landscape area adjacent
to a road or public right-of-way shall be increased by five (5) feet for every additional sixty (60)
feet of parking lot width perpendicular to the right-of-way as indicated in the following table:
Parking Lot Width
Required Landscape Area Width
1-60 ft.
15 ft.
61-120 ft.

361-420 ft.
45 ft.
5. Each landscape area adjacent to a street right-of-way shall contain a minimum of one (1) tree per
forty (40) feet of landscape area parallel to the right-of-way. In addition, a vegetative screen,
landscaped berm, fence, wall, or other methods to reduce the visual impact of the parking area
shall be provided. The vegetative screen shall have an average continuous height of three (3) feet.
A three (3) foot decrease in elevation from the adjoining property to the street right-of-way shall
be construed as satisfying the vegetative screen requirement.
6. Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the landscape area not occupied by other
landscape material.
7. Special notes on existing natural vegetation:
a. In all cases where significant natural vegetation exists, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, there will be limits of clearing/grading areas established to protect and
preserve these natural area. These natural areas will not be disturbed by the installation of
any structures, utilities, storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, sediment and erosion
control traps, stormwater management systems, signage. Existing landscape material
which is proposed to be used to fulfill landscape requirements shall be shown in the
required plan.
b. In the case where buffers are created by the application of these standards, no structures,
utilities, storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, sediment and erosion control traps,
stormwater management systems, and signage will be permitted.
XVII-18
c. Where pedestrian and bike paths are proposed in the landscape area, such paths shall be
meandering in order to preserve the existing trees.
8. Trees required as a part of the parking lot street right-of-way landscaping may be placed on the
right-of-way adjoining such vehicular use area when approved by the Planning Commission.
Such trees shall be in addition to any street trees required by the subdivision regulations.
9. Landscaping in Easements. The required landscape area for parking areas may be combined with
a utility or other easement only if all landscape requirements can be met. Otherwise, the
landscape area shall be in addition to, and separate from, any easement.
10. In any parking lot perimeter landscaping area all trees shall be set back at least four (4) feet from
the edge of paving where vehicles overhang.
Section 4. Interior Landscaping for Parking Lots
1. For any parking lot containing more than 6,000 square feet of area or fifteen (15) or more spaces,
interior landscaping shall be provided in addition to the previously required perimeter
landscaping. Interior landscaping shall be contained in peninsulas or islands. An interior parking
lot landscape island or peninsula is defined as a landscaped area containing a minimum area of
153 square feet having a minimum width of eight and one-half (8.5) feet and a minimum length
of eighteen (18) feet. There shall be a minimum of four (4) feet to all trees from the edge of
paving where vehicles overhang. The minimum landscape area permitted shall be ten (10) percent
of the parking area. Each island or peninsula shall be enclosed by appropriate curbing or a similar
device at least six (6) inches wide and six (6) inches in height above the paving surface. For
purposes of Subsection 4. below and subject to the limits established in 5. below, up to four (4)
islands can be combined.
2. Where a parking area is altered or expanded to increase the size to 6,000 or more square feet of
area or fifteen (15) or more vehicular parking spaces, interior landscaping for the entire parking
area shall be provided and not merely to the extent of its alteration or expansion.
3. Landscape area. For each 100 square feet, or fraction thereof, of vehicular use area, five (5)
square feet of landscaped area shall be provided. The interior landscaping requirement shall be
computed on the basis of the "net parking facility." For the purposes of this Section, "net parking
facility" shall include parking stalls, access drives, aisles, walkways, dead spaces, and required
separations from structures, but shall not include required street setbacks or access driveways or
walkways within such setbacks.
4. Landscape islands or peninsulas - number required:
a. For less than 100 spaces one island or peninsula is required for every seven (7) parking
spaces.
b. For 100 spaces or more, one island or peninsula is required for every ten (10) spaces.
c. Each ten (10) parking spaces shall require an interior planting island.
d. All interior parking aisles shall end in a landscape island.
XVII-19
5. Maximum contiguous areas for interior parking lot landscaping. In order to encourage the
required landscape areas to be properly dispensed, no required landscape area shall be larger than
the following:
a. 350 square feet in parking areas under 30,000 square feet.
b. 1,500 square feet in parking areas over 30,000 square feet.
6. Landscape areas larger than the above are permitted as long as the additional area is in excess of
the required minimum, except that landscape areas larger than the maximum permitted may be
allowed as required landscaping areas in those cases where significant natural vegetation exists.
7. Minimum plant materials. A minimum of one (1) tree for each 250 square feet or fraction thereof
of required landscape or for each five (5) spaces of required parking or for each 161 square feet of
island or peninsula, whichever is greater, shall be required. The remaining area of the required
landscaped area shall be landscaped with shrubs or ground cover not to exceed two (2) feet in
height, or grass.
8. Landscaping for service structures. All service structures shall be fully screened, except when
located in a single-family, agriculture, or industrial zone or when located more than thirty-five
(35) feet above the established grade. Service structures in an industrial zone shall be fully
screened when located within 100 feet of any zone other than industrial. For the purposes of this
article, service structures shall include propane tanks, dumpsters, air conditioning units and
condensers, electrical transformers and other equipment or elements providing service to a
building or a site.
a. Location of screening. A continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall, or earth mound shall
enclose any service structure on all sides unless such structure must be frequently moved,
in which case screening on all but one (1) side is required. The average height of the
screening material shall be one (1) foot more than the height of the enclosed structure, but
shall not be required to exceed eight (8) feet in height. Whenever a service structure is
located next to a building wall, perimeter landscaping material, or vehicular use area
landscaping material, such walls or screening material may fulfill the screening
requirement for that side of the service structure if that wall or screening material is of an
average height sufficient to meet the height requirement set out in this section. Whenever
service structures are screened by plant material, such material may count towards the
fulfillment of required interior or perimeter landscaping. No interior landscaping shall be
required within an area screened for service structures.
b. Protection of screening material. Whenever screening material is placed around any trash
disposal unit or waste collection unit that is emptied or removed mechanically on a
regular basis, a fixed barrier to contain the placement of the container shall be provided
within the screening material on those sides where there is such material. The barrier
shall be at least eighteen (18) inches from the material and shall be of sufficient strength
to prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied. The
minimum front opening of the screening material shall be twelve (12) feet to allow
service vehicles access to the container.
9. Interior landscaping for parking areas shall be installed and continuously maintained by the
owner according to the requirements contained in Article XVII Part I and II.
XVII-20
10. Landscape material type and quality shall be described in detail in the Article XVII Part II of this
ordinance.
11. Plan submission and approval. Whenever any property is affected by these parking area landscape
requirements, the property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape plan for approval
according to the requirements contained in the Article XVII, Part II of this ordinance.
12. Unnecessary paving or irregular paving plans are strongly discouraged and, if incorporated in a
site plan, shall be subject to approval by the Zoning Administrator.
13. Alternative parking area landscaping design may be considered by the permitting officials in
cases where unique topography and site constraints dictate such alternative. The innovative use of
planting design and materials is encouraged and will be evaluated on the intent demonstrated to
fulfill the stated objectives of this ordinance.
Section 5. Financial Security for Landscaping in Parking Facilities
1. A financial security in the form of a bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other security
approved by the Town of Elkton shall be furnished in accordance with the requirements set forth
in Article XVIII of this ordinance.
XVIII-1
ARTICLE XVIII SCREENING, SHADING, FOREST CONSERVATION AND
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
Part I Buffers
Section 1. Purpose
1. One of zoning's most important functions is the division of land uses into districts which
have similar character and contain compatible uses. All uses permitted in any district
have generally similar nuisance characteristics. Bufferyards will operate to minimize the
negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses.
2. The bufferyard is a combination of setback and a visual buffer or barrier and is a yard or
area together with the planting required thereon. Both the amount of land and the type
and amount of planting specified for each bufferyard requirement of this Ordinance are
specified and are designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent zoning districts to
ensure a desired character along public streets and roads. The planting units required of
bufferyards have been calculated to ensure that they do, in fact, function as "buffers."
3. Bufferyards shall be required to separate different zoning districts from each other in
order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of
lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce
adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions. Mature woodlands are
considered the best buffers and should be used whenever possible.
Section 2. Location of Bufferyards
Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel
boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public
or private street or right-of-way. Bufferyards shall not be located within a yard required in a
single family attached (townhouse) development or planned unit development.
Section 3. Determination of Required Bufferyard
To determine the type of bufferyard required on a parcel or between two parcels or between a
parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be used:
1. Identify whether any portion or property line of the site constitutes a zoning district
boundary. If it does, determine the zoning on both sides of the property.
2. Determine whether the land on the adjoining property is vacant or developed or whether a
plat of the subdivision has been approved.
3. Classify any street adjacent to the proposed use as a local, collector, or arterial street.
4. Determine the bufferyard required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject
parcel by referring to the Tables of Required Bufferyards.
5. Determine if the proposed development is a use which has bufferyards required to
separate that use from certain uses. Then determine the bufferyard required between such
uses by referring to the Tables of Required Bufferyards.
XVIII-2
Section 4. Responsibility for Bufferyards
1. When a proposed use adjoins a vacant parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the
presence of a zoning boundary, that use shall at the time of development provide one-half
(0.5) of the buffer which is required by the Tables of Required Bufferyards.
2. The second use to develop shall, at the time it develops, provide all additional plant
material and/or land necessary to provide the total bufferyard required between those two
(2) uses. If the adjoining use had developed without a bufferyard, the second use will be
responsible for installing the total bufferyard.
3. Existing plant material and/or land located on the preexisting (first developed) land use
which meets the requirements of this Ordinance may be counted as contributing to the
total bufferyard required between it and the second (adjacent) land use to develop.

Section 6. Bufferyard Requirements
Illustrations graphically indicating the specification of each bufferyard are contained in Appendix
C.
Section 7. Bufferyard Use
A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation or stormwater management. It may contain
pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails provided that: (a) no plant material is eliminated, (b) the total
width of the bufferyard is maintained, and (c) all other regulations of the Ordinance are met. (d)
In no event, however, shall swimming pools, tennis courts or other such uses be permitted in
bufferyards. The Planning Commission may allow substitution or reduction of the bufferyard if it
finds that the required bufferyard will obstruct the view of a driver or that the bufferyard is
incompatible with the existing streetscape.
Section 8. Ownership of Bufferyards
Bufferyards may remain in the ownership of the original developer (and assigns) of a land use, or
they may be subjected to deed restrictions and subsequently be freely conveyed, or they may be
transferred to any consenting grantees, such as adjoining landowners or the Town of Elkton
provided that any such conveyance adequately guarantees the protection of the bufferyards for the
purposes of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Bufferyards Which Exceed Minimum Requirements
Where the bufferyard required between a land use and vacant land turns out to be greater than
that bufferyard which is required between the first use and the subsequently developed use, the
following options apply:
1. The subsequent use may provide one half (0.5) of the buffer required by this Section. The
existing use may expand its use into the original buffer area, provided that the resulting
total bufferyard between the two uses meets the bufferyard requirements of this Section.
2. The existing use may enter into agreements with abutting landowners to use its existing
buffer to provide some or all of the required bufferyard of both land uses. The total buffer
shall equal the requirements of this Section. Provided that such an agreement can be
negotiated, the initial use may provide the second use some or all of its required
bufferyard and/or extra land on which it might develop. The existing use may reduce its
excess buffer by transferring part or all of the excess buffer to the adjoining landowner to
serve as its buffer. Any remaining excess buffer area may be used by the existing use for
XVIII-4
expansion of that use or for transfer by it to the adjoining landowner to expand that
adjoining use.
3. Any such arrangement as defined in Sections 1 and 2 above, shall be clearly indicated on
a site plan and shall be accompanied by legal documents as may be required by the
Planning Commission.
Section 10. Contractual Reduction of Bufferyards
When a land use is proposed adjacent to vacant land, and the owner of that vacant land enters into
a contractual relationship with the owner of the land that is to be developed first, a reduced buffer
may be provided by that first use, provided that: the contract contains a statement by the owner of
the vacant land of an intent to develop at no greater than a specified land use intensity class; and
an agreement by that vacant landowner to assume all responsibility for additional buffer, if
needed by the subsequent development of a less intense use than had been agreed upon, is
transferred to the owner of the vacant (second in time to be developed) land. Any such
arrangement to reduce bufferyards as described above, shall be clearly indicated on a site plan
and shall be accompanied by legal documents as may be required by the Planning Commission.
Section 11. Financial Surety and Maintenance of Bufferyards
1. The requirements for posting a financial surety and the procedures for partial release and
final release of financial sureties for bufferyards, shall be the same as for afforestation or
reforestation as defined in Part III, Section 12 of this Article.
2. The requirement to install bufferyards as defined in this section is an integral part of the
implementation of this Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan. Continued maintenance
of the bufferyards is essential in assuring that the intent of this Ordinance is continually
met. Once the financial surety has been released, failure to properly maintain the
bufferyard shall be deemed a violation per Article VII of this Ordinance.
Part II Shading
Section 1. Town Findings and Declaration of Policy: Shade Trees
1. The Town finds that:
a. Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival,
b. Trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon
dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe,
c. Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air
much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems,
d. Trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing through the
ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers,
XVIII-5
e. Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the ground water tables and play an
important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood
control,
f. Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic, and psychological counterpoint to the
urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and
cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the
monotony of human developments on the land, particularly parking areas, and
g. For the reasons indicated herein, trees have an important impact on the
desirability of land and therefore on property values.
2. Based upon the findings set forth in Subsection 1., the Town declares that it is not only
desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working
within the Town's planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and, under the
circumstances set forth in this article, to require the planting of new trees in certain types
of developments.
Section 2. Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets
Along both sides of all newly created streets that are constructed in accordance with the Elkton
street standards, the developer shall at a minimum either plant or retain sufficient trees so that
between the paved portion of the street and a line running parallel to and fifty (50) feet from the
centerline of the street, there is for every thirty-five (35) feet of street frontage at least an average
of one deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve (12) inches
in diameter. When trees are planted by the developer pursuant to this section, the developer shall
choose trees that meet the standards set forth in Appendix B.
Section 3. Tree Protection
The following regulations supplement, but do not supersede the Forest Conservation Ordinance
adopted by the Town of Elkton on December 22, 1992 and as amended. (See Article XVIII, Part
III)
1. Development of land for different uses and intensity of uses will often times necessitate
the removal of trees to accommodate roads, parking, buildings, and facilities. It is the
expressed intent of this ordinance that every effort be made through the design, layout,
and construction of development projects to incorporate and save as many trees as
possible.
2. No person shall cut, destroy, move, or remove any living, disease-free tree of any species
having a trunk with a diameter of eight (8) inches or larger, in conjunction with any
development of land governed by this ordinance unless and until such removal or
destruction has been approved under the provisions of this ordinance. Trunk diameter is
measured 4.5 feet above the ground, and is referred to as "diameter breast height (dbh)".
3. No person shall cut or clear land of trees for the sole purpose of offering land for sale.
4. The clear-cutting of trees is prohibited. The term "clear-cutting" as used herein shall
mean the cutting of more than 75 percent of the trees six inches in trunk diameter or
larger. Clear-cutting pursuant to an approved development plan shall require the planting
XVIII-6
of replacement trees as indicated in the detailed landscape plan accompanying the
development application.
5. A survey of all trees of applicable size shall be made and submitted in conjunction with
the development site layout. All trees proposed for removal shall be clearly noted. The
tree survey shall be certified by either a registered land surveyor, registered engineer, or
registered landscape architect.
6. The requirement for a tree survey is waived in the case of golf course construction or
when preliminary site evaluation reveals the ability to accomplish the proposed project
without removal of any trees eight (8) inches in diameter or larger. In the latter case, the
applicant shall submit a written statement that no trees will be removed, and his permit
will indicate No Tree Removal as a condition thereof.
7. Removal of endangered or valued trees will not normally be permitted. Trees included in
this category are:
-- American Elm (Ulmus americana)
-- American Holly (Ilex opaca)
-- Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum)
-- Pecan (Carya illinoensis)
-- Southern Magnolia (Magnolia Grandflora)
-- American Chestnut (Castanea Dentata)
8. Considerable damage to or the death of trees may result if more than six (6) inches of soil
is added around the base of a tree, more than 30 percent of circumferential bark is
removed, or more than 30 percent of the root system is removed. In addition, asphalt
paving, building construction, and soil compaction too close to trees may cause their
destruction. Accordingly, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to institute
alternative site designs to assure the best chance of tree survival whenever these criteria
cannot be adhered to.
9. Those trees designated for preservation in accordance with the provisions of this
ordinance as shown on the approved landscape plan shall be marked with bright blue
ribbons encircling the tree trunk at a height of four (4) feet above the ground, and a four
(4)-foot high barricade will be constructed around the tree at the drip line prior to the start
of construction.
10. As a condition of approval under this ordinance, the applicant may be required to plant
replacement trees for trees approved for removal as part of the final plan. In requiring
replacement trees, the following will be considered:
a. the intended use of the property;
b. the existing or pre-development tree coverage, sizes, and types;
c. the number, size, type, and location of natural trees proposed for preservation by
the applicant;
d. the grading, road, building, parking, and drainage requirements.
XVIII-7
e. Conformance with other provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 4. Retention and Protection of Large Trees
1. Every development shall retain all existing trees eighteen (18) inches in diameter or more
unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development.
2. No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of
any tree eighteen (18) inches in diameter or more, and no impervious surface (including,
but not limited to, paving or buildings) may be located within twelve and one-half (12 ½)
feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of any tree eighteen (18) inches in diameter
or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the
development. For purposes of this subsection, a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed
by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the
branches of that tree lands on the ground.
3. The retention or protection of trees eighteen (18) inches in diameter or more as provided
in Subsections 1. and 2. unreasonably burdens a developer if, to accomplish such
retention or protection, the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed
activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work
an unreasonable hardship upon the developer.
4. If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the
requirements of Subsections 1. or 2., and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in
Article XVII cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the
number of spaces "lost" because of the provisions of Subsections 1. and 2., up to a
maximum of fifteen (15) percent of the required spaces.
Section 5. Shade Trees in Parking Areas
1. Vehicle accommodation areas that are required to be paved must be shaded by deciduous
trees (either retained or planted by the developer) that have or will have when fully
mature a trunk at least twelve (12) inches in diameter. When trees are planted by the
developer to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, the developer shall choose trees
that meet the standards set forth in Appendix B.
2. Each tree of the type described in Subsection 1. shall be presumed to shade a circular area
having a radius of fifteen (15) feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must
be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, twenty (20) percent of the vehicle
accommodation area will be shaded.
3. No paving may be placed within twelve and one-half feet (12 ½) feet (measured from the
center of the trunk) of any tree retained to comply with Subsection 1., and new trees
planted to comply with Subsection 1. shall be located so that they are surrounded by at
least 200 square feet of unpaved area.
4. Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from
striking trees. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three (3) feet, six (6)
inches.

for each acre removed below the threshold.
Section 9. Priorities and Time Requirements for Afforestation and Reforestation
1. Sequence for Afforestation and Reforestation.
a. After techniques for retaining existing forest on the site have been exhausted, the
preferred sequence for afforestation and reforestation, as determined by the Town
of Elkton, is as follows:
(1) Selective clearing and supplemental planting on site;
(2) Onsite afforestation or reforestation, if economically feasible, using
transplanted or nursery stock that is greater than 1.5 inches diameter
measured at 4.5 feet above the ground;
XVIII-28
(3) Offsite afforestation or reforestation, using transplanted or nursery stock
that is greater than 1.5 inches diameter measured at 4.5 feet above the
ground in the same watershed, when the applicant has demonstrated that
no reasonable onsite alternative exists or where any onsite priority areas
for afforestation and reforestation have been planted in accordance with
this Ordinance and the applicant has justified to the satisfaction of the
Town of Elkton that environmental benefits associated with offsite
afforestation or reforestation would exceed those derived from onsite
planting;

for existing forested areas not currently protected in perpetuity, in which
case the afforestation or reforestation credit granted shall not exceed 50%
of the area of the forest cover protected.
(6) Offsite afforestation or reforestation may include the use of forest banks
approved by the Town of Elkton.
b. A sequence other than the one described in Subsection a of this Section may be
used for a specific project, if necessary and approved by the Department, to
achieve the objectives of the town land use plan or town land use policies, or to
take advantage of opportunities to consolidate forest conservation efforts.
c. The following are considered a priority for afforestation and reforestation:
(1) Establish or enhance forest buffers adjacent to intermittent streams to
widths of at least fifty (50) feet and to perennial streams to widths of one
hundred (100) feet;
(2) Establish or enhance non-forested areas on 100-year floodplain, when
appropriate;

forests within or adjacent to the site and where practical, forested
corridors should be a minimum of 300 feet in width to facilitate wildlife
movement;
(4) Establish or enhance forest buffers adjacent to critical habitats where
appropriate;
(5) Establish plantings to stabilize slopes of 25 percent or greater and slopes
of 15 percent or greater with a soil K value greater than 0.35 including
the slopes of ravines or other natural depressions;
(6) Establish buffers between areas of differing land use, when appropriate,
or adjacent to highway or utility rights-of-way;
XVIII-29
(7) Establish forest areas adjacent to existing forests to increase the overall
area of contiguous forest cover, when appropriate; and

3. No subdivision plat shall be recorded unless and until it shall have been submitted to and
approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
I-2
4. No person shall sell or transfer any such land by reference to, or exhibition of, or by other use of a
plat of a subdivision before such plat has been duly recorded under this Ordinance or a previous
subdivision ordinance, provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing

between the parties to the instrument.
5. Any person violating the provisions of this Ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable as provided for in Article C14-1A of the Charter and Code of the Town of Elkton for

equity jurisdiction or may recover the penalty by civil action in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
Section 6. Modifications
1. Modification of Requirements. Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision it can be
shown that strict compliance with the requirements of these regulations would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography or shape of the parcel or
other such non-self-inflicted condition or that these conditions would result in inhibiting the
achievement of the objectives of these regulations, the Planning Commission may, after
consultation with appropriate agencies, vary, modify, or waive the requirements so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variance,
modification, or waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
regulation or of interfering with carrying out the Comprehensive Plan of Elkton. In no case shall
any variation or modification be more than a minimum easing of the requirements and in no
instance shall it conflict with any zoning ordinance or zoning map. In granting variances and
modifications, the Planning Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment,
secure substantially the objectives of the requirements so varied or modified.
2. If changes from the approved final plat become necessary during construction of the subdivision,
an amended plat of the subdivision shall be filed with the Planning Commission for approval and
shall be recorded.
I-3
Section 7. Administration
1. Separability. It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that if a court of competent
jurisdiction declares any provision of these regulations to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in
part, the effect of such decision shall be limited to those provisions that are expressly stated in the
decision to be invalid or ineffective, and all other provisions of these regulations shall continue to
be separately and fully effective.
2. Changes and Amendments.

have an opportunity to be heard. At least 15 days notice of the time and place of such
hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town. After said
public hearing, the Planning Commission shall forward to the Town Commissioners its
recommendation concerning such change and amendment.
b. Upon receipt and prior to taking action on such change or amendment, and accompanied
by a recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Town Commissioners shall
schedule a public hearing in relations thereto; at least 15 days notice of the time and place
of such hearing shall be published in newspapers of general circulation in the Town.

ARTICLE III MINOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
Section 1. Minor Subdivision Approval
The purpose of this section is to establish the procedure that shall be followed by the developer, the
Planning Commission, and the Town staff in preparing, reviewing, and approving any subdivision
defined as a minor subdivision under the provisions of these regulations.
1. The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove minor subdivision final plats in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
2. The applicant for minor subdivision plat approval, before complying with Subsection 3., shall
submit a sketch plan to the Administrator for a determination of whether the approval process
authorized by this Section can be and should be used. The Planning Commission may require the
applicant to submit whatever information is necessary to make this determination, including, but
not limited to, a copy of the tax map showing the real property being subdivided and all lots
previously subdivided from that tract of land within the previous five (5) years.
3. Applicants for minor subdivision approval shall submit to the Planning Commission a plat
conforming to the requirements set forth in Article IV, Section 11 and Appendix A.
4. The Planning Commission shall take expeditious action on an application for minor subdivision
plat approval as provided herein. However, either the Planning Commission or the applicant may
at any time refer the application to the major subdivision approval process.
5. Not more than a total of three lots may be created out of one tract using the minor subdivision
plat approval process, regardless of whether the lots are created at one time or over an extended
period of time starting with the original effective date of this ordinance.
6. If the subdivision is disapproved, the Planning Commission shall promptly furnish the applicant
with a written statement of the reasons for disapproval.
7. Minor subdivisions shall comply with all requirements pertaining to the Elkton Critical Area as
established in the Elkton Zoning Ordinance and herein.
8. Approval of any plat is contingent upon the plat being recorded within nine (9)months after the
date the Certificate of Approval is signed by the Planning Commission or their designee.
9. Compliance with the requirements as set forth in Article IV, Section 1.2.b(4) and 1.2.b(5) of the
Elkton Subdivision Regulations relative to adjoining property owner notification and posting.
Section 2. Resubdivision, Addition and Subtraction of Lots
1. Resubdivision
a. Any modification, division, addition, deletion, or correction which is proposed to a
previously recorded lot or lots in a subdivision, the owner must file a "re-subdivision
plat" to be approved by those agencies normally approving Final Plats and recorded by
the Developer together with a notation in the form of a resolution, which shall be affixed
III-2
to the resubdivision plat. Changes occurring as a result of highway, road or street
improvement which require additional right-of-way shall not be require a resubdivision
plat to be recorded.
b. In cases where two (2) or more lots in the same ownership are effectively utilized to meet
zoning requirements for setbacks, yard requirements, density requirements, etc., a
resubdivision plat combining the affected lots into one lot will be required. An exception
to this will occur only when two lots are under one deed. Any remaining lots shall
conform to all existing Zoning requirements and; if conveyed shall not effectively create
a zoning violation on the remaining lots. If these two conditions cannot be met, the lot or
lots involved shall also be included on the resubdivision plat and shall become part of the
single parcel thereby created.

(5) A signature block for Planning Commission approval.
(6) A note on the plat stating the following:
"Application is hereby made for your approval of the indicated transfer of land
solely for adding to adjoining holdings and not for development. Any future
subdivision of this land or building development will be submitted in the regular
manner for approval in accordance with the existing subdivision regulations".
b. No transfer of land shall be approved if the original lot from which the transfer was made
causes said lot to be less than the minimum lot size for its zoning district or causes the lot
to be in violation of any other applicable zoning or health requirement.
3. The Planning Commission is empowered to approve land transfers described in this section and
such approval shall be noted on the survey plat.
4. The recorded survey plat shall be recorded with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cecil County.
IV-1
ARTICLE IV MAJOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
Section 1. Major Subdivision Approval
The purpose of this section is to establish the procedure that shall be followed by the developer, the
Planning Commission, and the Town staff in preparing, reviewing, and approving any subdivision
defined as a major subdivision under the provisions of these regulations. The provisions of these
regulations shall be considered as minimum requirements to promote and protect health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of Elkton. The Planning Commission shall require each subdivision to
conform to the Zoning Ordinance applicable thereto.
1. Types of Major Subdivision Plans. The following plan types are hereby created and defined as
the basic approval steps needed for a major subdivision:
a. Pre-application/Concept Plan. Allows the Planning Commission, and/or technical
review staff input in the formative stages of subdivision design including consideration
of a conceptual stormwwater management plan and a Forest Stand Delineation and
Preliminary Forest Conservation Plan
b. Preliminary Subdivision Plat. All proposed major subdivisions shall be first considered
by the Administrator as a preliminary subdivision plat. Upon approval of this plat by the
Planning Commission, the developer may seek improvement plan approval from the
Town. No lot may be sold or transferred or building permit obtained based upon an
approved preliminary subdivision plat. Preliminary subdivision plats shall be
accompanied by a preliminary stormwater management plan and preliminary forest
conservation plan.
c. Improvement Plan. The improvement plan is a detailed construction plan for public
improvements to be developed in conjunction with a subdivision, such as streets (public
or private), storm drainage, sanitary sewers, potable water, stormwater management and
other public facilities as well as afforestation or reforestation. Upon approval of this
plan by the Town, the developer may construct such improvements in accordance with
the approved improvement plan.
d. Final Subdivision Plat. Major subdivision plats shall receive their last official
consideration by the Planning Commission as a final subdivision plat. Upon approval of
the final subdivision plat by the Planning Commission and subsequent recordation, lots
may be sold or transferred and building permits obtained in accordance with the
approved final subdivision plat.
e. General Development Plan. This mechanism is designed to permit the developer of a
large-scale project to go before the Planning Commission with a conceptual description
of the development including stormwater management and forest conservation, but not
full engineering details of the project, and secure formal approval of basic development
parameters.
2. Pre-Application. For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing subdivision and site
plan design and development costs, the developer may request a pre-application conference
and/or concept plan in accordance with the following requirements:
IV-2
a. Pre-Application Conference.
(1) The pre-application conference shall allow the applicant to meet with Town
planning and engineering staff.
(2) Applicants seeking a pre-application conference shall submit the information
stipulated in Appendix A of this ordinance twenty (20) working days prior to the
conference.
(3) The applicant shall not be bound by the determination of the pre-application
conference, nor shall the Planning Commission or staff be bound by any such
review.
b. Concept Plan.
(1) In addition or as an alternative to the pre-application conference, the Planning
Commission shall review a concept plan. If the proposed subdivision includes
only a portion of a tract, a concept plan shall be required showing the general
layout of lots, streets, open space and other information as required in Appendix
A of these regulations. Concept shall be mandatory for major site plans and
major subdivision plans.
The purpose of the concept plan is to provide Planning Commission and staff
input in the formative stages of subdivision and site plan design.
(2) Applicants seeking concept plan informal review shall submit the items
stipulated in Appendix A of this ordinance twenty (20) working days before the
concept plan meeting.
(3) The applicant shall not be bound by any concept plan for which review is
requested, nor shall the Planning Commission be bound by any such review.
(4) Prior to the submittal of a concept plat to the Planning Commission, the
applicant shall to the extent possible, based on best available information, notify
by certified mail all contiguous (inclusive of property on the opposite side of
street) property owners of the proposal to subdivide the property. Notification
shall include the name, address and telephone number of the developer, date and
time of the Planning Commission Meeting, the acreage and zoning of the parcel
proposed for the subdivision, and the proposed number of lots. Proof of
notification shall accompany the concept plan submittal
(5) Additionally, the applicant shall be responsible for the erection and maintenance
of a clearly visible sign containing a copy of the proposed plat on each of the
property’s road frontages. Each plan shall be provided by the applicant and
fabricated to specifications provided by the Planning Department. The signs
shall be durable, weather resistant, have a minimum dimension of 30 inches by
36 inches and shall be maintained in place until the final plat approval. If the
Director of Planning or his/her designee determines that the applicant has failed
to maintain or properly install the sign(s) in compliance with these requirements,
the proposed project will be withdrawn from the Planning Commission agenda.
IV-3

Comprehensive Plan; Elkton's Critical Area Program, as applicable; requirements of the Zoning
and Subdivision Regulations, including the intent and purpose of those ordinances; and
recommendations of other Federal, state and County agencies.
4. Step 4: Agency Review.. The Planning Department may refer the subdivision and development
plans to any agency (State, Federal, or County) which it deems appropriate for their comments
and/or recommendations, the Planning Commission will determine the basis for approval or
disapproval of a proposed subdivision or development plan.
Approvals for specific elements of a subdivision or development plan including, but not limited
to, sedimentation and erosion control and sewerage disposal must come from those Departments
or other agencies (State or Federal) having jurisdiction in that area. All requirements for
acquiring approval of specific elements are contained in codes or regulations administered by the
agency or department responsible and are not necessarily available in this regulation.
5. Step 5: Submittal/Distribution, Revised Plans (if Required).
a. Preliminary subdivision plats that have been revised as to address the comments of the
review agencies shall then be submitted to the Planning Department for acceptance and
IV-4
distribution to appropriate review agencies.
b. If major redesign or major revision to the Preliminary Subdivision Plats is required, the
submission shall be processed as a new submittal (Step 1). The Planning Commission
will determine if the revisions constitute a major redesign or major revision.
6. Step 6: Agency Review, Revised Plat.
a. Review agencies review revised plat and comment in writing to Planning Commission.
b. Review agencies' comments or concurrence is sent to applicant and to the Planning
Commission by the Planning Department.
7. Step 7: Planning Commission Agenda. Upon determination that Preliminary Subdivision Plat is
in compliance with all applicable regulatory provisions, said plat is to be prepared for
presentation to the Planning Commission for consideration and recommendation at the next
available Planning Commission meeting.
8. Step 8: Planning Commission Meeting.
a. Preliminary Subdivision Plat applications listed on the Planning Commission Agenda for
proposed action are presented by the Planning Department. The Planning Commission
shall review the plat with regard to the following:
(1) Conformance to the land use provisions of Elkton's Comprehensive Plan as well
as these Regulations, the Zoning Ordinance, Stormwater Management
Regulations, Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and General
Conditions for Construction Contracts as may be amended, and provisions of the
Elkton Critical Area Program, where applicable;
(2) Guidelines that will promote the erection of buildings in areas that are free from
danger of flooding, erosion, stream siltation, unsuitable sanitary conditions and
other hazards; and
(3) Protection of wetlands, streams, areas of steep slopes and shoreline.
b. Applicant is notified in writing of Planning Commission recommendation.
9. Step 9: Planning Commission Action. No preliminary plats shall be considered for action by the
Planning Commission until they have been reviewed, and recommendations have been made, by
the appropriate review agencies, including but not limited to the Elkton Public Works
Department, the Maryland State Highway Administration, the Health Department and the Cecil
Soil Conservation District, as applicable. All preliminary plats shall be approved, conditionally
approved, or disapproved within 90 days of the date they are officially filed for Planning
Commission action. The Planning Commission shall act for approval, conditional approval with
conditions noted, postponement, or disapproval. Reasons for action of postponement or
disapproval and any requirements associated with a conditional approval shall be stated. The
following actions by the Planning Commission shall have the meanings so stated:
a. Approval means that the developer is authorized to proceed with the preparation of the
IV-5
required "improvement" plan. Preliminary plat approval automatically grants a developer
two (2) years within which he shall submit final plats for all property shown on the
preliminary plat for approval. Before expiration, the Planning Commission may extend
the approval period in increments not to exceed one (1) year at a time. In connection with
such request, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:
(1) change in adjoining land use,
(2) change in street and highway plan, and/or
(3) change in zoning or subdivision regulations.
A request for extension of Preliminary approval shall be filed thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Preliminary Plat approval.
In conjunction with such approval extensions, the Planning Commission shall have the
right to require changes in the development when it finds that time has necessitated such
changes for the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the community or when
applicable ordinances and regulations have been changed. Upon the expiration of any
approval period specified under this section, the plat shall be deemed as disapproved by
the Planning Commission.
Any approved Preliminary Plat or any plat continued for further study by the Planning
Commission shall be exempted from any changes in the subdivision regulations for a
period of two (2) years from the date of approval of the Preliminary Plat. Exemptions
from changes in subdivision regulations law shall not be extended even if the
Preliminary Plat approval is extended as provided above.
b. Conditional approval means the developer may proceed with preparation of the
"improvement" plan, but only after the preliminary plat has been corrected to reflect all
requirements placed on the plat by the action of the Planning Commission. Actual
approval of the Preliminary Plat shall not be made until such conditions have been
satisfied. The Planning Commission may allow conditions of preliminary plat approval
to be addressed on the final plat.
c. Postponement means Planning Commission action is delayed for definite reasons, which
shall be noted by the Planning Commission. Certain specified changes may have to be
made in the plats, but no completely new re-submittal of the plat is required of the
developer. However, all preliminary plats shall be approved or disapproved within 90
days of the day they are officially filed for Planning Commission action unless the
developer agrees to a longer postponement.
d. Disapproval means disapproval of the plat. For further action, the developer must file a
new application along with a filing fee and preliminary plat copies as required under
Article IV, Section 1.
Section 3. Technical Review Procedure -- Improvement Plan
1. Step 1: Application and Distribution. The developer shall file the required copies of the
improvement plan, prepared and stamped by a registered civil engineer, and fully conforming to
IV-6
all applicable Town regulations and the approved preliminary plat with the Planning
Commission's comments addressed.
2. Step 2: Review. The Planning Commission and/or other agencies shall review the proposed
improvement plan and, within 120 working days, notify the developer in writing of the approval,
conditional approval, or disapproval of the plan.
a. Approval means the developer is now authorized to proceed with preparation of the final
plat.
b. Conditional approval means the developer may proceed as described above for
"approval", but only after the required copies of the corrected improvement plan have
been submitted to the Planning Commission. The improvement plan shall be deemed as
disapproved if the fully corrected plan is not filed within ninety (90) days of the Planning
Commission's notification.
c. Disapproval means disapproval for the reasons stated in the notification by the Planning
Commission. For further consideration, the developer must resubmit the improvement
plan as a completely new improvement plan.
Section 4. Final Plat Procedure
The final plat is the culmination of the subdivision process and shall include all information necessary to
comply with this section of these regulations. The final plat is intended to become the official record of
the division of land within a development and no lot therein may be sold legally until a Final Plat has
been approved by the Planning Commission and recorded by the Developer. The Final Plat shall not be
recorded until a Public Works Agreement and a signed letter of credit is posted.
The Final Plat shall basically follow the procedural requirements for Preliminary Plat procedure. All
major final subdivision plats shall be processed as follows:
1. Pre-Application Conference. The developer is urged to prepare a draft of the proposal and
discuss it informally with the Planning Commission and other government and utility agencies in
order to share information and open a dialogue at the earliest stages of the process. This
conference is not a mandatory pre-requisite to the formal filing of the final subdivision plat by
the developer.
2. Application, Distribution, and Review. The application, distribution, and review procedures for
final subdivision plats shall be generally a two-step procedure: pre-approval from any agency
required to give approval, and approval by the Planning Commission. After approval of the
Preliminary Plat, the Developer shall submit his Final Plat. Submittal shall be presented to the
Planning Department. Applications are submitted to the Planning Department, at the Building
and Planning Office, for completeness review at least twenty (20) working days before the
Planning Commission meeting. Submittal shall be accompanied by 13 copies of the Final Plat,
fees, and required Public Improvement Plans and shall be certified by the Planning Department
as to the date of receipt and provide notification requirements as described in Section 1, Major
Subdivision Approval, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs (b) (4) and (b) (5) of this Article. (amended
Ordinance 7-2014)
IV-7
3. Planning Commission Action. All final plats shall be approved or disapproved within ninety (90)
days of the date they are officially filed for Planning Commission action. The Planning
Commission will review the staff and technical review agency recommendations and then act for
approval, conditional approval with conditions noted, postponement, or disapproval. The reasons
for action of postponement or disapproval and any requirements associated with a conditional
approval shall be available to the developer and the public. The following actions by the
Planning Commission shall have the meanings so stated:
a. Approval means the final plat is ready to be approved by the Planning Commission, with
no further corrections or revisions of the plat required by the developer.
b. Conditional approval means the final plat cannot be approved by the Planning
Commission until the developer has complied with the conditions of approval set forth in
the Planning Commission's action on the plat.
c. Postponement means that the Planning Commission has deferred action in order that
certain clarification can be made in regard to the plat. No completely new re-submittal is
required of the developer as is the case for disapproval. However, all final plats shall be
approved or disapproved within ninety (90) days of the date they are officially filed for
Planning Commission action unless the developer agrees to a longer postponement.
d. Disapproval means disapproval of the plat. In order to request a new review and action,
the developer must file a new application along with a filing fee, plat copies, and other
material as required under this Section.
e. Final Plats must be brought before the Planning Commission at their regular meeting
before they can be signed and recorded as directed by this regulation. The Chairman of
the Planning Commission shall be empowered to sign the final plat when satisfactory
review indicates that said plat meets all requirements of the Ordinance and all conditions
of approval of said plat have been met. The final plat is reviewed against the preliminary
plat and any modification contained herein. The authorized signature of the Health
Department shall be affixed to the plat prior to signing by the Chairman. Upon approval,
the developer, or his representative, shall submit to the Planning Department the original
Final Plat and public improvement plans for signature by the various agencies.

ARTICLE V GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
Section 1. Purpose
The purpose of this article is to establish the basic and minimum design and improvement standards that
will be required as a pre-condition to development of any property or in conjunction with the
development for lots, streets, utilities, and other physical elements in a subdivision. Standards exceeding
these minimum requirements may be provided by the developer or required by the Planning Commission.
A major direction of this Article is to promote development that is most harmonious with the existing
environment while providing guidelines and standards to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. To
achieve this end, development should follow as closely as possible the contour of the land and should be
designed to minimize cuts and fills. The developer's engineer shall design the work, and the Town's agent
shall review all design work and inspect the improvements during construction.
Section 2. General Site Design Standards
1. A site analysis shall be made of the characteristics of the development site, such as site context,
geology and soil limitations, topography, steep slopes, climate, ecology, visual features, past
(historical) and present use of the site, and existing vegetation, structures, and road networks.
2. Subdivision and Site Design
a. Design of the development shall take into consideration all existing local and regional
plans for the surrounding community.
b. Development of the site shall be based on the site analysis. To the maximum extent
practicable, development shall be located to preserve the natural features of the site, to
avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative impacts and alteration
of natural features.
c. The following specific areas include, but are not limited to, areas that shall be preserved
as undeveloped open space, to the extent consistent with the reasonable use of land, and
in accordance with applicable state or local regulations:
(1) Unique and/or fragile areas, including tidal and non-tidal wetlands and their
buffers as defined in Section 404 of the most current Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments and as shown on wetlands maps prepared by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (sketch plat) and field delineated on-site (preliminary
and final plat);
(2) Significant trees or stands of trees, defined as the largest known individual trees
of each species in the state, large trees approaching the diameter of the known
largest tree, or species or clumps of trees that are rare to the area or of particular
horticultural or landscape value (see Article XVIII, Part III for Forest
Conservation Requirements);
(3) Lands in the flood plain, as defined in Article II and elsewhere in Town
regulations;
V-2
(4) Habitat Protection Areas in the Elkton Critical Area;
(5) Historically significant structures and sites, as listed on Federal, State, County, or
Town lists of historic places. A Phase I Archeological Investigation may be
required by the Planning Commission if it is determined that significant historic
or archeological resources could be impacted.
(6) Sensitive Areas for which special standards, designed to protect these areas from
the adverse effects of development, have been included in the Elkton Zoning
Ordinance (See Article XVIII, Part IV) including:
(a) Streams and their buffers;
(b) 100-year floodplain;
(c) Habitats of threatened and endangered species;
(d) wetlands and their butters;
(e) Steep slopes; and
(f) Any other areas determined by the Town.
d. The development shall be laid out to avoid adversely affecting ground water and aquifer
recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to avoid unnecessary impervious cover; to prevent
flooding; to provide adequate access to lots and sites; and to mitigate adverse effects of
shadow, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties.
e. Development in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area shall also comply with the design
standards of Elkton Critical Area Program and the Elkton Zoning Ordinance (See Article
IX, Part IV).
f. Stormwater Management
(1) No concept, preliminary or final plat of subdivision shall be approved unless a
plan for stormwater management is submitted by the developer as appropriate
and approved by the Town Engineer in accordance with the Town Stormwater
Management Ordinance.
(2) Subdivisions may be exempted from this provision if it qualifies for an
exemption as provided in Elkton's Stormwater Management Ordinance and such
waiver is approved by the Mayor and Commissioners. However, subdivisions
located in Intensely Developed Area (IDA) of Elkton's Critical Area shall not be
exempted from the requirement that pollutant loadings leaving the site be
reduced by at least ten (10) percent of pre-development loadings.
(3) In the event that storm water must be managed or contained, stormwater
management facilities shall be planned, designed, improved, and constructed as
required in accordance with Elkton's Stormwater Management Ordinance.
V-3
3. Residential Development Design
a. Newly platted and configured residential lots shall front on residential access or subcollector
streets, not on collector or arterial streets or roads.
b. Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles, as well as for those
needing access to the property in its intended use.
c. The placement of units in residential developments shall take into consideration
topography, privacy, building height, orientation, drainage, and aesthetics.
d. Buildings shall be spaced so that adequate privacy is provided for units.
e. Residential structures shall be located and sited to facilitate pedestrian and visual access
to common open space whenever possible.
f. All single family detached and attached (duplex, semi-detached and townhome)
dwellings shall be designed and constructed with an entrance to the front and rear of the
dwelling.
g. Cluster open space intended for a recreation or public use shall be easily accessible to
pedestrians.
h. Diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building design shall be encouraged
to achieve the best possible relationships between development and the land.
i. Individual lots, buildings, and units shall be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding
properties, to improve the view from the view of buildings, and to lessen areas devoted to
motor vehicle access.
j Individual lots, buildings, units, and parking areas shall be situated to avoid the adverse
effects of shadows, noise, and traffic on the residents of the site.
k. Orientation of lots and dwellings to maximize solar access and conservation of energy
shall be encouraged.
l. When proposed, cluster boxes and development monument signs shall be indicated on the
subdivision plans and shall be located on separate lots from residential dwellings.
4. Commercial and industrial developments shall be designed according to the same principles
governing the design of residential developments as specified in 3. above, including but not
limited to; buildings shall be located according to topography, with environmentally sensitive
areas avoided to the maximum extent practicable; factors such as drainage, noise, odor, and
surrounding land uses considered in siting buildings; sufficient access shall be provided; and
adverse impacts buffered.
5. Circulation System Design
a. The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and orderly movement of
traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present and future population served; to
V-4
have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to
present an attractive streetscape.
b. In residential subdivision, the road system shall be designed to serve the needs of the
neighborhood and to discourage use by through traffic except where the subdivision
street implements any aspect of the Transportation Plan element of the Elkton
Comprehensive Plan.
c. The pedestrian system shall be located as required for safety. In conventional
developments, walks shall be placed parallel to the street, with exceptions permitted to
preserve natural features or to provide visual interest. In planned developments, walks
may be placed away from the road system, but they may also be required parallel to the
street for safety reasons.
d. Bikeways/lanes and/or signage shall be required as indicated in the Elkton Bicycle Plan.
6. Landscape Design
a. Reasonable landscaping should be provided at site entrances, in public areas, and
adjacent to buildings. The type and amount of landscaping required shall be allowed to
vary with the type of development, except that the Bufferyard provisions of Article
XVIII, Part I shall be complied with as required. All required landscaping shall be
guaranteed with a Landscape Agreement or included in the Public Works Agreement.
b. The plant or other landscaping material that best serves the intended functions shall be
selected. Landscaping materials shall be appropriate for the local environment, soil
conditions, and availability of water. The impact of the proposed landscaping plan at
various time intervals shall also be considered. Wherever possible, native species shall be
utilized.
7. Open Space and Recreation. Residential subdivisions, including Planned Unit Developments and
residential cluster developments shall be required to provide neighborhood parks and open space
as specified in Article XIII, Section 9 and Article XIV of the Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
Developed open space shall be designed to provide active recreational facilities to serve the
residents of the development. Undeveloped open space shall be designed to preserve important
site amenities and environmentally sensitive areas.
Section 3. Adequate Public Facility Standards
In addition to the specific design standards and requirements contained herein, the following minimum
site conditions shall exist prior to Planning Commission approval of any subdivision, whether such
facilities are provided by the developer, a private utility, or the Elkton Town Government. In pursuit of its
responsibility and obligation to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of existing and future
residents in any subdivision with Elkton, the Planning Commission may disapprove the subdivision of
land if it is found that any one public facility is not adequately provided for in the proposed subdivision,
including but not limited to, adequate sewer and water.
1. The following shall be the minimum standards for utilities such as telephone supply, electric
supply, water supply, or other utilities:
V-5
a. Every subdivision shall be provided with a proper telephone and electric system as
required in Article XV of the Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
b. Every subdivision shall be provided with a complete water distribution system adequate
to serve the area being developed with pipe lines, valves, fire hydrants, and other water
facilities as required.
c. Easements for new, or the continuations of existing, utilities shall be provided for all
subdivision with the width or other characteristics as required by the Town.
2. Every subdivision shall be provided with a sewage disposal system approved by the Health
Department, the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction, and the Town. Construction
requirements shall be as approved by the MDE.
3. Every subdivision shall be designed in accordance with Environment Site Design principles to
maximum extent practicable in accordance with the Elkton Stormwater Management Ordinance.
4. The Planning Commission will review each proposed subdivision to determine whether it is
served by proper community access roads. The Planning Commission may postpone or deny
approval of any such subdivision until it has determined that such needs are properly met. The
Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit a Traffic Impact Study. The study area
and parameters of said study shall be established by the Town and the State Highway
Administration if applicable.
Section 4. Reserved
Section 5. Lot and Block Standards
1. In general, intersecting streets, which determine block length, shall be provided at such intervals
as necessary to meet existing street patterns, topography, and requirements for safe and
convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Residential blocks generally shall not exceed
1,600 feet in length, nor be less than 500 feet in length, with the block width generally being
sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width
shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways. Non-residential
blocks shall be of such length, width, and other design as the Planning Commission finds
necessary for the prospective use, including adequate provision for off-street parking, truck
loading and unloading, buffer areas, pedestrian movement, and proper vehicular access to
adjacent streets. Whenever practicable, blocks along major arterial and collector streets shall be
not less than 750 feet in length.
2. Lot Shape. Excessive depth in relation to width should be avoided, with a proportion of 2.5 to 1
normally considered a desirable maximum for lot widths of 60 feet or greater. Pointed or very
irregular-shaped lots shall be avoided where possible. Pie shaped lots shall not be permitted.
Additional depth of at least 20 feet over the minimum lot depth shall be required on lots that back
up to railroads or are through lots. Flag, pipe-stem, or panhandle lots are permitted, except
however, not more than two (2) such lots may have adjoining driveway entrances to a public
right-of-way. In addition, any subdivided lot greater than five (5) acres in size may be required to
provide an 85 foot wide panhandle, otherwise the minimum size of the panhandle shall be 25 feet.
V-6
3. Lot Frontage and Access. All lots shall abut an approved public street for at least the minimum
frontage requirement for the zone in which the lot is located. Frontage shall be measured at the
street right-of-way line, except that in cases where curved streets or cul-de-sac radii are involved,
the measurements shall be taken at the building line as set forth for the zone in which the lot is
located, or, if more restrictive, as set forth on the subdivision plan. All lots shall be designed so as
to provide safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access to the street.
4. Lot Lines. Side lot lines should generally be at right angles to straight street centerline and radial
to curved street center lines. However, this design standard is not intended to prohibit the creation
of lots at a reasonable angle to the street where the intent of the developer is to create a northsouth
lot orientation for the purposes of maximizing the potential for use of solar related energy
and technology and techniques.
5. Lot Area and Minimum Building Setback Line. Lots for residential or non-residential use shall
meet the minimum standards required by the Zoning Ordinance. In no case shall any new
residential lot hereafter platted be of less size or width than what is designated on the Zoning Map
and described in the Zoning Ordinance for said Zoning District in which the lot is located except
as may be provided elsewhere in this ordinance. All residential lots shall include adequate area to
accommodate a 10 foot wide deck extending from the rear of the dwelling that does not infringe
on any required setback.
6. Corner Lots. Corner lots should be of sufficient width and depth to equal non-corner lots in
subdivision plus sufficient area to comply with the required minimum building setback line on
each street frontage.
7. Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where
employed to prevent excessive vehicular driveway access to streets, to avoid fronting lots on nonaccess
streets and highways, to separate residential areas from other areas of conflicting land or
traffic use, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
8. Land Remnants. If remnants of land exist after subdividing and have no apparent future use that
can be properly controlled, they shall be incorporated into the lots of the proposed lotting scheme
(See Article IV, Section 14 of these Regulations).
9. Street Addresses. Street address numbers shall be assigned to each lot by the Planning
Department in order to provide a separate and distinct address for each lot.
10. Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary street. Where
driveway access from a major or secondary street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the
Planning Commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to
limit possible traffic hazard on such street. Where possible, driveways should be designed and
arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major or secondary arterial
streets.
11. Building lines shall be shown on the plan, along each street, at least as required in each case by
the applicable regulations. The locations of these lines shall be clearly indicated by dimensions.
12. All lot measurements shall be net measurements, not including any part of any street, alley, or
crosswalk. Easements, however, shall be regarded as within the lot.
V-7
Section 6. Reserved
Section 7. Planned Unit Developments
Design Requirements for a Planned Unit Development shall comply with all requirements in the Zoning
Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations unless Article XI of the Zoning Ordinance specifically sets forth
an alternate requirement or standard.
Section 8. Special Requirements Applicable to Residential, Commercial and Industrial
Subdivisions
1. In development designed and used exclusively for rental occupancy under single ownership, the
maintenance of the local roads, storm drains, stormwater management systems, water and sewer
facilities and any other improvements shall be retained by the owner and shall meet Elkton's
Department of Public Works Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and General
Conditions for Construction Contracts, the Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable ordinances.
2. Site development plans and commercial and industrial subdivision plats shall be submitted in the
same manner and contain the information, style and format as required of residential
development.
3. Condominiums. In condominium development, the developer shall submit the necessary
Preliminary Plat and Final Plat in accordance with the normal procedural requirements, and the
Condominium Act of the Real Property Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
Section 9 . Reservation or Dedication of Land for Parks, Open Space, Schools, and Other
Public Facilities
1. The developer, in the design of the subdivision plan, and the Planning Commission, in the review
of the plan, shall consider the adequate provision of sites for parks, open space, schools, and other
public facilities as indicated in the Comprehensive Plan. Where such facilities are shown and
located in the Comprehensive Plan or where the Planning Commission otherwise determines that
a portion of the land is required for such public facilities -- especially in large-scale residential
developments not anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan -- the developer may be required to
reserve such sites for a period not to exceed two (2) years after preliminary subdivision plan
approval, during which time the developer shall deed the property to the Town.
2. The Planning Commission shall require from each subdivision either a dedication of land to the
Town or a fee in lieu of said land in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article XIV of the
Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
Section 10. Preservation of Natural Features and Amenities
1. Existing features that would add value to residential development or to the local government as a
whole -- such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic sites, and similar irreplaceable
assets -- shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision.
2. Trees shall be preserved in accordance with the Town Forest Conservation Regulations and/or the
Critical Area regulations and other requirements of the Town Zoning Ordinance. Notwithstanding
the requirements of the Forest Conservation Regulations or the Critical Area requirements, the
V-8
Planning Commission may still require certain stands of vegetation or individual trees, bushes,
etc., to be left undisturbed. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of
grade of the land affected until approval of the plat has been granted and a clearing and grading
plan has been submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission or their designated
representative. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where
required shall be welled and protected against change of grade. In no case shall the Planning
Commission allow any developer to completely clear growth from any lot unless not doing so
shall cause undue hardship for the developer and can be so shown to the Planning Commission at
the time of review.
3. All subdivisions shall be designed in accordance with Article XVIII, Part IV Environmental
Standards for Sensitive Areas of the Town Zoning Ordinance.
4. Where a tract of land bordering water compound is to be subdivided, a buffer shall be reserved. In
addition, the Planning Commission may require a buffer be reserved around any other impounded
water body.
a. If lot ownership extends to the water, wetlands or tributary stream bed, then the Buffer
shall be included in the required setback distance for building on that lot except in the
case of water-dependent facilities. Where the Buffer is to be owned and maintained by
the Town the required setback distance shall be measured from the property line
separating that lot from the designated Buffer. This Buffer, when not included in the lots,
may be included in calculating gross density.
b. Within the buffer, no excavating or grading shall be permitted, except for the provision of
access to the shoreline. Community access shall be provided for by allowing one (1)
point of access of at least thirty (30) feet in width for any amount of shoreline up to one
thousand (1,000) feet and one (1) point of access for every additional one thousand
(1,000) feet of shoreline. Within the remainder of the development, seasonal control of
excavation and grading may be a recommendation for inclusion in the Sedimentation and
Erosion Control Plan as approved by the Cecil County Soil Conservation District.
c. Natural vegetative cover shall be preserved to the maximum degree possible. In the
buffer zone, sufficient trees and ground cover shall be preserved to insure, in the opinion
of the Cecil County Soil Conservation District, that natural soil stability and water
absorption capacity are not impaired.
Section 11. Development in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area
All subdivisions shall be designed in accordance with Article IX, Part IV Critical Area District of the
Town Zoning Ordinance.
Section 12. Land Suitability
1. No land shall be subdivided for building development that is held unsuitable for its intended use
by the Planning Commission for reasons of flooding, inadequate drainage, excessive slope, severe
erosion potential, or any other natural features that may be harmful to the health, safety, and
welfare of future residents, property owners, or the community at large.
V-9
2. All improvements necessary to make land suitable for development shall be in full compliance
with any other laws and ordinances regulating such improvements and with any conditions as
may be required by the Planning Commission to reduce risks to health and safety.
3. When a subdivider does not intend to develop the plat himself and the improvements are
necessary to reduce hazards and to make land suitable for development, the Planning Commission
shall require appropriate deed restrictions to be inserted on every deed and noted on every
recorded plat.
Section 13. Landscaping and Tree Planting Standards
All land subdivision plans shall conform to the requirements of Article XVIII of the Elkton Zoning
Ordinance.
1. Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The protection of trees six (6) inches or more
in diameter (measured diameter at breast height) shall be given high priority in determining the
location of open space, structures, underground utilities, walks, and paved areas. Areas in which
trees are preserved shall remain at original grade level and shall remain undisturbed wherever
possible.
2. Where extensive natural tree cover and vegetation does not exist, landscaping shall be provided to
enhance the appearance of the development, aid in erosion control, provide protection from wind
and sun, screen streets and parking areas, and enhance the privacy of dwelling units.
Section 14. Historic Zones
All land subdivision occurring within historic zones as defined by this Ordinance shall conform to the
requirements of Article IX, Part III of the Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
Section 15. Provision of Common Open Space
Common open spaces (spaces designed and intended for the use and enjoyment of all residents of the
development) may contain such complimentary structures, improvements as are necessary and
appropriate for the use, benefit, and enjoyment of residents of the development. Open space provided for
the purpose of protection of existing site features may include areas in agricultural use. Common open
space areas shall meet the requirements contained in Article XIV of the Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
Section 16. Lot Coverage
Impervious surfaces (surfaces that do not absorb rain, including all buildings, roads, sidewalks, patios,
parking areas, and any other areas paved in concrete or asphalt) shall be minimized to the maximum
extent possible. Efforts to minimize impervious surfaces shall be encouraged. Lot and density and
dimensional regulations are contained in Article XIII of the Elkton Zoning Ordinance.
Section 17. Subdivision Name
The subdivision name approved by the Planning Department and recorded shall constitute the
subdivision's official name. No other name may be used for advertising or sale purposes unless an
amended and approved plat is recorded bearing the revised name.
VI-1
ARTICLE VI STREETS AND SIDEWALKS
Section 1. Street Classification
1. In all new subdivisions, streets that are dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided in
Subsection 2.
a. The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be carried by the
street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day;
b. The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful indicator
of the number of trips but is not conclusive;
c. Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated
outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued
beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will be based
upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.
2. The classification of streets shall be as defined in Article II of these Regulations.
Section 2. Access to Lots
Every lot shall abut an approved public road that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and
egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its
intended use. The Planning Commission shall have the right to approve or disapprove any point of
ingress or egress to any lot, tract, parcel or development from any street or highway. In approving ingress
or egress from any State highway the Commission can only approve those access points that are not in
conflict with safety standards of the State Highway Administration or with the right-of-way or through
the highway line of a limited or denied access highway.
Section 3. Access to Arterial Streets
Whenever a major subdivision that involves the creation of any new streets borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided from the lots within this
subdivision onto this arterial street.
Section 4. Entrances to Streets
All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the Town's planning jurisdiction shall be
constructed so that:
1. Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to
themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles travelling on abutting streets, and
2. Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic on abutting or surrounding streets is
minimized.
3. The maximum permitted slope on driveways is ten (10) percent.
VI-2
Section 5. Coordination with Surrounding Streets
1. The street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing, proposed, and anticipated
streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion of a single tract that is being divided into
lots (hereinafter, "surrounding streets") as provided in this section.
2. Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and
convenient locations.
3. Sub-collector, local, and minor residential streets shall connect with surrounding streets where
necessary to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or to
facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons,
but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the use of such
streets by substantial through traffic.
4. Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this
section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of
the subdivided property (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at
the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition, the
Town may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the end of such streets pending
their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or
accommodate emergency vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, no
temporary dead-end street in excess of 500 feet may be created.
5. Planning for conflicting traffic or land use. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains, or is
adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, arterial or expressway rights-of-way, or conflicting changes
in land uses, the Planning Commission shall require marginal access streets, reverse frontage
lots, lots with rear service, or other such treatment as may be necessary for protection of abutting
properties and to afford separation of conflicting types of traffic or land use.
Section 6. Relationship of Streets Topography
1. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to
facilitate the drainage and storm water runoff objectives set forth in the Elkton Stormwater
Management Ordinance, and street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original
topography.
2. The maximum grade at any point on a street constructed without curb and gutter shall be 6
percent. On streets constructed with curb and gutter the grade shall not exceed 6 percent unless
no other practicable alternative is available. However, in no case may streets be constructed with
grades that, in the professional opinion of the highway engineer, create a substantial danger to
the public safety.
Section 7. Street Width, Sidewalk, and Drainage Requirements in Subdivisions
1. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry motor
vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; (ii) to serve as an important link in the
town's drainage system. In order to fulfill these objectives, all public streets shall be constructed
to meet the standards of the Town of Elkton’s Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and
VI-3
General Conditions for Construction Contracts, as amended.
2. Except as otherwise provided, all streets shall be constructed with curb and gutter and shall
conform to the requirements of the Town of Elkton’s Standard Specifications, Construction
Details, and General Conditions for Construction Contracts, as amended. Street pavement width
shall be measured from flowline to flowline where 90 degree curb is used, and from the center of
the curb where roll-type curb is permitted.
3. Sidewalks are required in all subdivisions on both sides of all streets, except alleys. Sidewalks
shall be dedicated as part of the right-of-way of all streets.
4. Sidewalks are required to connect the street frontage to all building entrances, parking areas,
open space, and any other destination that generates pedestrian traffic.
5. Sidewalks shall connect to existing sidewalks on abutting parcels.
6. The sidewalk material shall continue across driveways.
7. The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five (5) feet in width and constructed
according to the specifications set forth in the Town of Elkton’s Standard Specifications,
Construction Details, and General Conditions for Construction Contracts, as amended.
8. Whenever the Town finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from the subdivision to
schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently
provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets, the developer shall be required to provide
sidewalks and/or reserve an unobstructed easement of at least 10 feet in width to provide such
access.
Section 8. General Layout of Streets
1. The arrangement of streets shall conform to the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive
Plan.
2. Streets in new developments should maintain the existing street grid where present, and restore
any disrupted street grid where feasible.
3. The orientation of streets should enhance the visual impact of common open spaces and
prominent buildings create lots that facilitate passive solar design, and minimize street gradients.
All streets shall terminate at other streets or at public land, except local streets may terminate in
stub streets when such streets act as connections to future phases of the development. Local
streets may terminate other than at other streets or public land when there is a connection to the
pedestrian and bicycle path network at the terminus.
4. Loop streets are encouraged so that through traffic on residential streets is minimized. Similarly,
to the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets shall be minimized to facilitate the
free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.
5. Cul de sac streets shall be discouraged but may be permitted by the Planning Commission where
no practical alternatives exist. Where permitted, such streets may not extend more than 300 feet
VI-4
(measured to the center of the intersection to the center of the turnaround). Longer cul-de-sacs
may be permitted because of unusual topographic or other conditions and, in such cases, the
Planning Commission may require additional paving width if necessary to prevent overloading of
street capacity. Temporary turnarounds may be required at the end of stub streets as long as it is
retained within the street right-of-way.
6. Half streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-of-way and pavement width) shall not
be permitted except where such streets, when combined with a similar street, developed
previously or simultaneously, on property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a
street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this chapter. When streets are
constructed adjacent and parallel to an adjoining property, the right-of-way shall be established
at the common property line. Reserve strips shall be prohibited.
7. Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed 1,600 feet, unless no other
practicable alternative is available.
8. Roads serving development shall be shall be located to avoid disturbance to Habitat Protection
Areas as described in the Elkton Critical Area Program. When no alternative exists and such
infrastructure must cross or be located in Habitat Protection Areas, the developer shall
demonstrate how impacts to Habitats have been minimized and that no feasible alternative
location for such infrastructure exists.
9. Where a major subdivision plat includes only part of the tract owned by the developer, sketch
plat layout of proposed streets and roads, if applicable, for the entire tract shall be submitted.
10. A cul-de-sac street that ends within 100 feet of an adjacent collector, arterial or major
thoroughfare street shall provide a 5 feet wide sidewalk in a 10 feet wide easement connecting
the sidewalk on the cul-de-sac to the sidewalk on the adjacent collector, arterial or major
thoroughfare street.
11. Dead-end roads and alleys are prohibited.
12. Intersections connecting alleys with other alleys are prohibited.
Section 9. Street Intersections
1. Streets shall intersect at right angles, and no two streets may intersect at less than 90 degrees. Not
more than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless the Town Engineer certifies that
such an intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.
2. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with existing
or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a centerline
offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerline of the intersecting streets
shall be not less than 150 feet.
3. Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two streets may intersect
with any other street on the same side at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from
centerline to centerline of the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the
distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet and in conformance to Maryland
VI-5
State Highway Administration Criteria. Developments abutting a State Highway must obtain
access approval from the State Highway Administration prior to receiving final approvals from
the Planning Commission.
4. Maximum grade through an intersection is five (5%) percent.
5. Multiple intersections involving junction of more than two (2) streets shall be avoided.
6. The roadway edge at street intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a maximum
radius of 15 feet for local streets and 20 feet for intersections involving collector or arterial
streets. The intersection of a local street and an access lane or alley shall be rounded by a
tangential arc with a maximum radius of 10 feet. In a case where more width is deemed
necessary to provide safe sight distance or for traffic channelization, the Planning Department
shall specify a greater radius than normally cited above.
7. Intersections with State Highways shall be located not less than seven hundred and fifty (750)
feet apart; measured from centerline to centerline. Intersections with County arterial roads shall
be located not less than four hundred and fifty (450) feet from centerline to centerline, as
determined by the Official County Road Map.
Section 10. Construction Standards and Specifications
1. Construction and design standards and specifications for streets, sidewalks, and curbs and gutters
are contained in the Town of Elkton’s Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and General
Conditions for Construction Contracts, as amended. Town Road Ordinance and all such facilities
shall be completed in accordance with these standards.
2. The developer shall be required to repair damage to town roads, drainage facilities, curbs, gutters
and sidewalks as a result of grading or construction activities in his or her subdivision.
3. If the proposed road involves a highway under the jurisdiction of the State Highway
Administration, it shall be the responsibility of the developer/owner to obtain all necessary
permits from that agency.
Section 11. Public Streets in Subdivisions
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all lots created after the effective date of this
section shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access
requirement set forth in Article VI, Section 2. For purposes of this subsection, the term "public
street" includes a preexisting public street as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets
the public street standards of this chapter and is dedicated for public use. Unless the recorded
plat of a subdivision clearly shows a street to be private, the recording of such a plat shall
constitute an offer of dedication of such street.
2. The approval of a final subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance
by the Town of any street shown on said plat. Acceptance of streets by the Town of Elkton
occurs only after all public improvements have been completed in accordance with the
requirements of the Mayor and Commissioners as expressed in Town of Elkton’s Standard
Specifications, Construction Details, and General Conditions for Construction Contracts, as
VI-6
amended.
3. Dedication of Public Way. Whenever a tract to be subdivided adjoins or embraces any part of a
highway, major road, or other public way so designated in the Transportation Plan section of the
Town's Comprehensive Plan, such part of said public way shall be platted and dedicated by the
subdivider in the location and at the width indicated on the plan.
Section 12. Road and Sidewalk Requirements in Un-subdivided Developments
1. Within un-subdivided developments, all private roads and access ways shall be designed and
constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and pedestrian
traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and gutter, and paving specifications shall be determined by
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance dealing with parking (Article XVII) and drainage. To the
extent not otherwise covered in the foregoing articles, and to the extent that the requirements set
forth in this article for subdivision streets may be relevant to the roads in un-subdivided
developments, the requirements of this article may be applied to satisfy the standard set forth in
the first sentence of this subsection.
2. Whenever a road in an un-subdivided development connects two or more sub-collector, collector,
or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make
use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to
subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in un-subdivided
developments within the Town are constructed in accordance with the specifications for
subdivision streets, the Town may accept an offer of dedication of such streets.
3. In all un-subdivided residential development, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units
with other dwelling units, the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking areas,
laundry facilities, and recreational areas and facilities
4. Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from
an un-subdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that
such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer shall
be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least 10 feet to provide such access and
construct sidewalks within the easement.
5. The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five (5) feet wide and constructed
according to the Town of Elkton’s Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and General
Conditions for Construction Contracts, as amended.
Section 13. Attention to Handicapped in Street and Sidewalk Construction
1. Whenever curb and gutter and/or sidewalk construction is used on public or private streets per
Section 12. above, wheelchair ramps for the handicapped shall be provided at intersections and
other major points of pedestrian flow. Wheelchair ramps and depressed curbs shall be
constructed in accordance with published standards in the latest version of the Americans With
Disabilities Act Standards for Design.
Section 14. Street Names and House Numbers
VI-7
1. Street names shall be assigned by the developer subject to the approval of the Town. Proposed
streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. Newly
created streets shall be given names that neither duplicate nor are phonetically similar to existing
streets, regardless of the use of different suffixes (such as those set forth in Subsection 2.). All
street names shall be approved by the Cecil County Department of Emergency Services
2. Street names shall include a suffix such as the following:
a. Circle. A short street that returns to itself.
b. Court or Place. A cul-de-sac or dead-end street.
c. Loop. A street that begins at the intersection with one street and circles back to end at
another intersection with the same street.
d. Building numbers shall be assigned by the Town.
Section 15. Bridges
All bridges shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the Maryland
Department of Transportation, except that bridges on roads not intended for public dedication may be
approved if designed by a licensed engineer.
Section 16. Utilities
1. Utilities installed in public rights-of-way or along private roads shall conform to the
requirements set forth in Article XV of the Elkton Zoning Ordinance and the Town of Elkton’s
Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and General Conditions for Construction
Contracts, as amended.
2. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities or
drainage facilities within the street right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements for such
utilities shall be provided across property, outside street right-of-way, of at least ten (10) feet in
width.
Section 17. Requirements for Development Adjoining Existing Roadways
Whenever a subdivision is proposed abutting an existing public roadway that does not meet the right-ofway
and pavement width standards contained herein for the functional classification of the street, and the
Planning Commission finds that development of the subdivision will increase the volume of traffic on
such street to a significant degree, the following requirements shall apply:
1. The developer shall be required to dedicate right-of-way along the entire street frontage to a
width that will provide one-half the total right-of-way width necessary to comply with the
standards contained herein. It is assumed that the same right-of-way dedication will be required
on the opposite side of the roadway at such time as that property develops, thereby providing the
full necessary right-of-way width.
2. Roadway widening improvements (including paving, curb, gutter, and sidewalk where
VI-8
appropriate) shall be required as necessary to bring the roadway up to the full cross section
requirement so contained in this Ordinance. The physical construction of such improvements by
the developer shall be required; however, in certain cases, the Town Commissioners may require
a cash payment or letter of credit in lieu of construction if recommended by the Planning
Commission.
3. The maximum liability of any developer under this Section shall not exceed right-of-way and
improvements as for collector streets contained herein. In cases where the ultimate proposed
cross section would be a four-lane arterial highway, developers may be required to dedicate
excess right-of-way above the collector standard. In consideration of such dedication, widening
improvements usually shall not be required in such cases for full road frontage, but, rather,
improvements such as turn lanes shall generally be required in association with new intersecting
streets or other access points when necessary to provide as safe situation as possible under the
circumstances.
Section 18. Traffic Calming.
1. Traffic calming features such as curb extensions at intersections and mid-block, traffic circles,
and medians may be used to encourage slow traffic speeds.
a. Speed Humps. Roadway design in residential developments shall incorporate speed
humps as traffic calming features in accordance with the following guidelines and the
Standard Specifications, Construction Details, and General Conditions for Construction
Contracts for the Town of Elkton:
(1) Speed humps shall be provided for roads with posted speed limits of 30 mph or
less;
(2) Speed humps are to be placed 300 feet apart and a minimum of two-hundred
(200) feet from intersections. Cul-de-sacs and roads less than five-hundred (500)
feet long do not warrant speed humps;
(3) Speed humps are to be continuous across all lanes of traffic to discourage erratic
driving;
(4) Speed humps are to be located mid-block along a property line whenever
possible;
(5) Speed humps shall be placed adjacent to street lights whenever possible;
(6) Speed humps are not to extend into bicycle lanes or drainage gutters;
(7) A minimum of twelve (12) inches along curb lines and edge of pavement is to be
maintained clear of the speed hump and taper;
(a) Speed humps shall not be placed in the following locations:
(b) Grades steeper than 8%,
VI-9
(c) Adjacent to driveways and catch basins,
(d) Directly over utility lines, utility service lines (water service and sanitary
laterals), manholes, and water valves,
(e) Within a horizontal curve with a radius less than three-hundred (300)
feet;
(8) Speed hump warning signs are to be placed one-hundred twenty-five (125) feet
in advance of the hump.
