SAVOY - MUNICIPAL CODE 2003 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the Village of Savoy, Illinois 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Savoy, Illinois Municipal Code, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2017-29, passed December 6, 2017.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the village as accessible as possible to village officials, village employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06 can be added between Chapter 2.04 and Chapter 2.08. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

Chapter 12.08 - UTILITY EXCAVATIONS 
Sections: 

12.08.010 - Policy established. 
    The village sub-street utility excavation and trench backfill policy is established. The policy shall become effective as of June 15, 1994 and shall consist of the following provisions. 
(Ord. 940601C § I (part)) 
12.08.020 - Backfill methods. 
A.  Beginning on June 15, 1994 and thereafter, all street cut trenches made either to existing pavements or sidewalks or future pavement areas shall be backfilled utilizing one of two recommended methods: those being the use of controlled low strength materials (CLSM) or, alternately, the placement of thin (six-inch maximum) mechanically compacted lifts of CA6 or CA10 aggregate materials as approved by the village. Water inundation or jetting of the fine aggregate backfill material will not be permitted. The proper backfill shall extend not less than two feet in each direction from the edge of the pavement. 
B.  "CLSM" is defined as a mixture of Portland cement, fine aggregate, water, fly ash and air-entraining admixtures. The mix shall be proportioned to provide a backfill material which is self-compacting and capable of being excavated with hand tools, as necessary, at a later date. Materials and proportioning shall comply with IDOT's Special Provision for Controlled Low-Strength Material as adopted on January 1, 1990 and revised as of March 1, 1990 or shall consist of one of the mix designs as shown below: 
MIX NO. 1Portland cement 50 lbs. Fly ash 200 lbs. Fine aggregate (SSD saturated surface dry) 2,990 lbs. Water 49-57 gal. (as directed) MIX NO. 2Portland cement 185 lbs. Fine aggregate (SSD saturated surface dry) 2,990 lbs. Air-entraining admixtures 6 fluid ounces Water 49-57 gal. (as directed)  
    These qualities will give an approximate yield of one cubic yard. 
    The mixing of the CLSM shall be as specified in Section 803 of the "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction" or as approved by the director of public works. 
C.  For both the CLSM and granular backfill methods, the top twelve (12) inches of the excavation shall be filled with soil of similar composition to that of the adjacent subgrade. The twelve (12) inches of soil shall be compacted to at least ninety five percent (95%) of maximum dry density. (AASHTO T99) with no more than one hundred ten percent (110%) optimum moisture. 
(Ord. 940601C § I(A)-(C)) 
12.08.030 - Compliance with IDOT Special Provision for Controlled Low-Strength Material required. 
    Placement of CLSM, operation limitations, measurement methods and basis of payment, if applicable, shall all be in compliance with the IDOT Special Provision For Controlled Low-Strength Material as adopted January 1, 1990 and revised as of March 1, 1990. 
(Ord. 940601C § I(D)) 
12.08.040 - Restoration of concrete pavement. 
    When a trench is cut into an existing concrete street or sidewalk, the pavement shall be replaced in-kind with a total thickness two inches greater than existing to a maximum of ten (10) inches. When restoring concrete pavement, the entire slab into which the trench was cut shall be removed and replaced. If the surface is either asphalt or oil and chip, a six-inch concrete shall be installed and two inches of bituminous concrete base shall be placed over the base. Replacement pavement shall be installed no less than a distance of two feet in each direction from the edge of the excavation trench. 
(Ord. 940601C § I(E)) 
12.08.050 - Replacement of utility structures required when. 
A.  All utility structures (i.e. shut-off valves, vault boxes, lids, poles, lines, markers etc.) that pose a threat to public safety shall be replaced when directed by the village director of public works or building inspector. Failure to make the repairs within an approved time frame will result in a penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per day. 
B.  Any failures occurring outside of the original restored or repaired pavement or right-of-way area resulting from the utility activity will be repaired by the responsible utility company. 
(Ord. 940711B § 1; Ord. 940601C § I(F), (G)) 
12.08.060 - Installation of underground utilities-Notification to village. 
    Any person, firm, corporation or entity which plans to install any underground utilities within a present or proposed street or sidewalk right-of-way area is required to notify the village public works or zoning department a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours prior to beginning work. The notification shall include the exact location and nature of the work to be performed. In emergency situations, the village shall be notified immediately upon the responsible party's decision that excavation is required. Roadway or sidewalk area repairs or restorations made without proper notification may require re-excavation and replacement with approved backfill. 
(Ord. 940601C § I(H)) 
12.08.070 - Variances. 
    Variance from any of the utility excavation policy provisions as stated above may be granted, on a case by case evaluation basis, by the village director of public works. All variances granted shall be specifically outlined in writing and include a justification for the variance. Factors to be considered in rendering a variance decision may include, but not be limited to: 
A.  Specific trench width and/or depth; 
B.  Actual size of concrete slabs affected; 
C.  Pipe size; 
D.  Conditions of surrounding soil and/or pavement; 
E.  Extent of variance requested; 
F.  Environmental circumstances at work site; and 
G.  Extent of possible future public damage. 
    Any questions, concerns or disputes regarding interpretation or administration of this chapter may be referred by an affected party to the village street and sewer committee who, by majority vote, shall have final authority in resolving such matters. 
(Ord. 940601C § I(I)) 
12.08.080 - Right-of-way excavation permits 
A.  Permits are required for utility excavations within any village right-of-way. 
B.  Such utility work within or affecting the village rights-of-way will require the contractor to furnish the village engineer evidence of liability insurance coverage naming the village of Savoy as an additional insured. Additionally, a three-year bond for an amount equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), or one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the estimated value of the repair, whichever is greater, will be required for any such utility work that requires street cuts or sidewalk cuts or other removal and replacement of village infrastructure. 
C.  The village engineer is empowered to issue right-of-way excavation permits for any use of village streets or other public property for periods of no longer than one hundred eighty (180) days for construction purposes. 
D.  Subject to any applicable franchise agreement provisions, fees for issuance of a temporary permit pursuant to this section shall be as follows: 
For Up to 7 Days For Each Day 8-180 Major arterial street $70.00 $120.00/lane/day Minor arterial street  70.00  60.00/lane/day Commercial collector street  70.00  30.00/lane/day Residential collector street  70.00  12.00/lane/day Local street  70.00  6.00 lane/day Sidewalk/parkway  70.00  6.00/sidewalk/day  
    Fees for total closure of the street shall be double the single lane fees. 
E.  For projects that cover large lineal distances, each individual permit will cover up to one mile in length. Additional permits will be required for each additional mile. 
F.  The village of Savoy reserves the right to require appropriate traffic control measures as shown in the Illinois Department of Transportation's Highway Standards in areas affected by the utility work as directed by the village engineer, zoning administrator, or village manager. 
G.  Permit applications shall include estimated construction schedules, general construction plans including site restoration provisions, erosion control measures (if needed), traffic control measures, and a list of contact information for the entity performing the work. 
H.  Entities working on village right-of-way without a permit are subject to fines as provided in Section 1.12.010 of the Savoy Municipal Code.

    No person shall hereafter construct, build, establish, replace or maintain any dry weather water outlet which discharges onto a public right-of-way, public street, public sidewalk, or other public property maintained by the village without first obtaining a permit to do so, as hereinafter provided. Residents may obtain a copy of the "Application for Permit for Dry Weather Water Outlet" forms from the village. These forms can be obtained from the building commissioner, or authorized deputy, at the Savoy Village Hall. Completed applications shall be submitted in duplicate along with a nonrefundable fee. The amount of the fee will be established from time to time by the board of trustees, but shall not exceed, for any one inspection, the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(Ord. 840201A § 2) 
12.12.030 - Discharge prohibited where. 
A.  Dry weather water outlets are prohibited from discharging directly onto public sidewalks, public streets or driveways within the public right-of-way and are prohibited from discharging in any way that would cause water to flow onto any public sidewalks, streets, or driveways within the public right-of-way. 
B.  Dry weather water outlets are prohibited from discharging onto any public property, public right-of-way, public street or public sidewalk if such discharge creates or contributes to a public hazard or public nuisance. 
C.  It is unlawful to connect any dry weather water outlet to public pipes, field tile, or stormwater drainage system or to allow the dry weather water outlet to discharge onto any public property without having obtained a permit as required by this chapter. 
D.  It is unlawful to allow any dry weather water outlet to discharge into or to cause water to flow into a roadside ditch or other drainage ditch or drainage easement without having obtained a permit as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. 840201A §§ 3-6) 
12.12.040 - Dry weather water outlet-Discontinuance required when-Exception. 
    Any dry weather water outlet heretofore constructed or established, without a permit therefor, as required by the terms of this chapter, shall be discontinued within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the adoption of this chapter, unless, within such one hundred eighty (180) day period after the date of the adoption of this chapter, a permit has been applied for and such permit is thereafter issued by the appropriate authorities of the village. 
(Ord. 840201A § 7) 
12.12.050 - Permit application-Review-Inspection.

    If an extension of the public sanitary sewer across an intermediate property is required to provide sewer service to a particular property or facility, and if another property or facility could be served and would be benefited by the public sewer extension across the intermediate property, the entity extending the public sanitary sewer may be allowed to recapture a proportional share of the cost of the sewer extension across the intermediate property from the benefited party. 
    The village board of trustees shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether recapture of off-site sewer extension costs shall be allowed. In the event that recapture is allowed, the village shall determine the proportional share to be recaptured. The entity extending the public sanitary sewer shall be allowed the opportunity to recapture cost for a ten (10) year period only commencing at the time the public sewer is accepted by the village. 
    The village shall establish a special assessment connection or hook-up fee for those benefited properties and shall collect the charges at the time the properties are connected to the public sewer system. 
    The village shall reimburse the entity which extended the public sewers upon collection of the special assessment connection fees. The village shall allow the collection of a reasonable interest charge to be agreed upon at the inception of the project. 
    Alternatively, the village, if it so elects, may pay the proportional share of intermediate benefited properties to the entity extending the public sewer and shall assess and collect the special assessment connection fees and a reasonable interest charge from the benefited intermediate properties. The village shall not be limited to a ten (10) year period for collection of special connection fees. 
    If the village itself is the entity which extended the public sanitary sewer, the village may recapture its share of the extension cost, as determined by the board of trustees, by the imposition of special connection fees or a user fee surcharge.

Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the board of trustees. 
(Ord. 930203B § 607) 
13.04.470 - Specific construction requirements. 
A.  Vertical Requirements. Where possible, the building sewer to serve a new building shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor or below the lowest plumbing fixture or building drain. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost and shall, at a minimum, be forty-two (42) inches from the ground level to the top of the pipe. The building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade insofar as possible. Changes in slope shall be made only with properly curved pipe, fittings, or at a manhole facilitating servicing. In all buildings in which the outlet from the lowest plumbing fixture or any building drain is too low to provide gravity flow to the public sewer, all sewage from such fixtures or building drain shall be lifted by approved mechanical means in accordance with this chapter and discharged into the building sewer. No water operated sewage ejector shall be used. 
B.  Horizontal Alignment. Insofar as possible, the building sewer shall be laid in straight alignment. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings or at a manhole. 
C.  Size and Slope. Only the following sizes and minimum slopes of building and private sewers shall be allowed: 
Size Minimum Slope 4-inch 1/4 inch per foot 5-inch 1/4 inch per foot 6-inch 1/8 inch per foot 8-inch 0.006 feet per foot  
D.  Cleanouts. Cleanouts shall be required and installed in appropriate locations in accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code and shall be constructed in a watertight fashion. Cleanouts shall be capped with a watertight lid to prohibit intrusion of unpolluted water into the public sewer system. All details of cleanout location and construction for nonresidential users shall be subject to the approval of the village. 
E.  Pipe Material and Joints. All building and private sewers constructed within the jurisdiction of the village and which may, at the time of construction or in the future, be connected to the public sewer system shall be constructed of the following materials and conforming to the specifications indicated or the latest designation thereof: 
1.  Extra-strength vitrified clay sewer pipe (ASTM Specification C-700) extra strength vitrified clay pipe (ASTM C700 and C425) with a factory installed PVC bell and collar joints (material meeting ASTM Specification D-1784); 
2.  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe (ASTM Specification D-3034, type PSM for four-inch through fifteen (15) inch) with minimum wall thickness Standard dimension ratio (SDR) of 35 and joints shall be solvent (welded ASTM Specification D-2855) or push-on flexible elastomeric seals (ASTM Specification D-3212); 
3.  Ductile iron pipe (ANSI A-21.51 or AWWA C-15I), class thickness designed per ANSI A-21.50 or AWWA C-150 with mechanical or rubber ring slip seal or pushon joints (AWWA C-111 and C-600); 
4.  Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) composite pipe (ASTM Specification D-2680) with solvent welded joints (ASTM Specification D-2680) or mechanical joint compressed "O" ring flexible elastomeric seals (ASTM Specification D-3212), or ABS solid wall pipe with solvent welded joints (ASTM Specification 2751); 
5.  Other pipe and fittings not specified above may be used when specifically authorized by the executive in charge. 
F.  Fittings, Couplings, and Connections. Fittings and couplings shall be made of the same or compatible material as the pipe material or as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. For the connection of two sections of sewer pipe of different sizes or of the same size but different materials, the use of appropriate reducer/increaser or adaptor or pipe coupling specifically made for the coupling of the two pipe sections shall be required. All jointing and connections shall be as recommended by the pipe manufacturer and be made gas-tight and watertight. 
G.  Construction of Lines. All building and private sewers shall be laid on firm undisturbed soil with the barrel of the pipe resting on the shaped bottom of the trench. A small excavation shall be made at the joint so as to permit proper joining of the pipe and to eliminate bridging from joint to joint. Where excess excavation has been made it shall be backfilled to proper grade with pit-run sand for proper bedding of the pipe. Granular or selected backfill shall be placed and compacted to a depth of at least two pipe diameters over the top of the pipe. For sewers on private property, the trench shall be backfilled at the option of the owner. Within public street or alley right-of-way and within areas of present or future pavement or sidewalk, the trench around and above the sewer pipe to the level of the subgrade shall be backfilled with compacted granular backfill and subject to the approval of the village. 
H.  Relation to Potable Water Facilities. No building or private sewer shall be constructed in the same trench or within ten (10) feet of a potable water service line. Any part of a sewer that is located within ten (10) feet of a potable water service line shall be laid in a separate trench and at such an elevation that the top of the sewer is at least eighteen (18) inches below the bottom of the water service pipe. If it is impossible to attain the required horizontal or vertical separation, the sewer shall be constructed of ductile iron or PVC water main pipe and be pressure tested to assure water tightness. Sewers within fifty (50) feet of a private well for potable water use shall also be constructed of ductile iron or PVC water main pipe. 
I.  Connections to Public Sewers. The connection of any building or private sewer to the public sanitary sewer system shall be made only at an existing service lateral extended to the property, an existing wye or tee in a main line sewer, or an existing service stub from a manhole. 
    In the event a service lateral, wye, tee or manhole stub does not exist, a connection may be made to an existing manhole. The invert of any building sewer made at a manhole must enter the manhole between the centerline and the top of the main sewer line or just above the concrete bench in the manhole. The opening through which the pipe enters the manhole structure shall be completely and firmly filled with jointing materials consisting of mortar or non-shrink grout finished on the inside, and with a bituminous waterproof coating applied on the outside of the manhole at the connection. If the ground elevation is changed at the manhole, the owner or his or her agent shall reset the cover to the proper elevation, at no expense to the village. The village will be notified of the reset and may inspect such work for compliance with village specifications. 
    In the event of the absence of a service lateral, wye, tee, manhole stub or existing manhole, the connection to the public sanitary sewer shall be made by one of the methods: 
1.  Manhole. Installation of a manhole. 
2.  Installation of Hub Wye Saddle. Circular saw-cut of sewer main by proper tools ("sewer tap" machine or similar) and proper installation of hub wye saddle, in accordance with manufacturer's recommendation. This method shall not be allowed when the wye branch size is larger than one-half the main sewer size. 
3.  Installation of Wye Branch Section. Remove an entire section of pipe and replace with a wye branch section of the same or similar material. The pipe section shall be removed by breaking only the top of one bell. After the pipe section has been removed, a pipe cutter shall be used to cut the pipe removed to a length which will allow it to be inserted between the new wye branch and the in-place sewer pipe with no more than a one-half inch gap between cut ends of pipe. This section shall then be installed. The hub end of the wye branch shall then be inserted into the bell of the in-place sewer after the bell end of the wye branch has been cut neatly and accurately with a pipe cutter. 
    Use "Mission" or approved equal couplings properly fastened with bands to hold them firmly in place. The entire disturbed area under and around the fitting and an area, a minimum of two times the thickness of the pipe above, shall be replaced with road pack (crushed rock) and compacted. 
4.  Installation of Proper Fitting. Using pipe cutter only, neatly and accurately cut out desired length of pipe for insertion of proper fitting. Remove both hub and bell end or other compression couplings from the wye branch fitting to allow the wye branch to be inserted with no more than a total of one-half inch gap. Use "Mission" couplings, or approved equal couplings, properly fastened with bands to hold them firmly in place. Backfill and compact with road pack (crushed rock). 
5.  If another method is desired, a detail shall be submitted for review and approval by the village before the connection is made. Indiscriminate breaking of the sewer main pipe is not allowed. 
    Connection of an eight-inch diameter private sewer to the public sanitary sewer system shall be by means of a manhole only. 
    Actual connection to a public sanitary sewer main line shall only be done in the presence of the village building and/or plumbing inspector, or public works inspector or his or her designated representative. If, in making a connection, a section of sewer pipe is cracked or broken, that section shall be replaced with the same or similar material. 
    The area repaired may be subject to a television inspection within six months after the repairs were made. Should the inspection reveal leaks or other faulty construction, the contractor and property owner shall be required to correct the faulty work and be responsible for any damages and all costs incurred. 
(Ord. 930203B § 608) 
13.04.480 - Ownership and maintenance responsibility. 
    Building and private sewers shall be and shall remain the property of the owner of the lot or parcel of real estate being served and any required repairs, maintenance, or cleaning shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Should, at some future time, the sewer service line be found to be defective, permitting the introduction of storm or ground water into the system, the sewer line shall be repaired at the property owner's expense so that such entry is stopped. 
(Ord. 930203B § 609) 
13.04.490 - Surface restoration. 
    When existing pavement, sidewalk, yard area, ditches or other surface treatments on public rights-of-way are removed in the course of making a sewer connection, the surfaces shall be restored to meet their original condition in accordance with the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois and with the requirements of the village. All costs related to restoration shall be borne by the entity directly benefiting from the connection. Temporary street repairs are permissible only upon the prior approval of the village manager and public works superintendent. Street cuts shall be made only at such times and in such manner as approved by the village following at least forty-eight (48) hours notice to the village.

Chapter 13.08 - SANITARY SEWER FEES AND CHARGES 
Sections: 

13.08.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the connection to and use of public and private sewers within the jurisdiction of the village, in order to comply with applicable federal and state standards, and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to establish connection fees and inspection fees coincident thereto. The construction, maintenance and repair of all sewage disposal systems, sewers and sewer service lines including the connection to all sewers within the village shall be under the direction of and subject to the approval of the village whether constructed or maintained by the village or by private firms, individuals or utilities, as provided in village ordinances and building codes. The intent of this chapter is to provide reasonable standards and procedures for connection and inspection of new building sewers to the public sewers within the jurisdiction of the village. 
(Ord. 930203C § 1) 
13.08.020 - Connection fees. 
    There shall be a connection fee required to connect a new private sewer or building sewer to the village's existing public sanitary sewer system. The connection fee for a single-family residence (the basic unit) shall be four hundred thirty-two dollars ($432.00) per each unit for any properties located within the Savoy municipal limits. The connection fee for any properties located outside of the Savoy municipal limits which are served by lateral lines connecting into the village sanitary sewer system shall be eight hundred sixty-four dollars ($864.00) per unit. 
    For types of occupancy other than residential, the connection fee shall be determined by multiplying the connection fee for a single unit by the number of units applicable to the type of use. The number of units applicable to the type of commercial use shall be determined according to the regulations governing connection fees established by the Urbana and Champaign Sanitary District (U&CSD Ordinance 202 or subsequent replacements or amendments.) 
    For industrial uses, the number of units shall be determined by Urbana-Champaign Sanitary District. The connection fee shall be the number of units determined multiplied by the charge per unit. In the case of industry, each charge is to be reviewed and adjusted at the end of the first three years of full operation of the industry. This adjustment to the average annual operation experience and settlement, shall be made within three months thereafter. 
    The connection fees for all other uses not hereinabove classified are to be determined by the board of trustees of the village with the recommendation of the village engineer and Urbana-Champaign Sanitary District. The number of units shall be determined by considering the amount of flow for the user and utilizing the standards of 0.6 pounds of oxygen demand and four hundred (400) gallons of flow per one unit per day. The connection fee shall be the number of units determined multiplied by the charge per unit. 
(Ord. 2007-01 § 1; Ord. 931006A § 1; Ord. 930203C § 2)

13.08.050 - Inspection fee. 
    Private sanitary sewer extensions, construction of building sewers and private sewage disposal systems shall be subject to inspection by a designated administrative agent of the village, as more fully set forth in the village sewer use ordinance. Use and operation of a private sanitary sewer extension, building sewer, or private sewage disposal system shall not take place until the facility is properly inspected. A permit for operation of a private sanitary sewer extension, building sewer, or private sewage disposal system shall not become effective until the installation has been inspected and is completed to the satisfaction of the village manager or designated representative. A nonrefundable inspection fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be charged for each inspection made within the Savoy municipal limits. A fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) shall be charged for each inspection conducted outside of the municipal boundaries. No written permit for connection or construction of a private sanitary sewer extension, building sewer, or private sewage disposal system shall be issued until the inspection fee has been paid. 
    The inspection fee paid at the time of issuance of a connection permit shall include one initial inspection of uncovered line and one reinspection by the designated village administrative agent. If more than one reinspection visit is required, an additional reinspection fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per visit shall be payable in advance to the village until after payment of the applicable reinspection fee. 
(Ord. 930203C § 5) 
13.08.060 - Special project connection fees. 
    From time to time as may be warranted, the village may deem it necessary to participate in the extension of sanitary sewer facilities to areas not currently served by village sanitary sewers. Such extensions may be by participation in a local improvement project, a special service area project, by agreement with some or all of the owners of the properties to be served, or by other means. The village may establish, by resolution of the board of trustees, special project connection fees, which shall be charged in addition to the normal connection fee outlined in Section 13.08.020. The special project connection fee established shall be for the purpose of distributing the costs of the sanitary sewer facility extension to those properties benefited by the extension in a fair and equitable manner. The special project connection fee may include the costs incurred by the village on behalf of the property owners, including interest costs incurred to the date of application. The properties which are benefited by the facility extension and to which the special project connection fee is applicable shall be identified by the village at the time of the establishment of the fee. No connection of a private sanitary sewer extension or building sewer shall be made to an existing village sanitary sewer until such time as any special project connection fee due the village has been paid. When the property benefited and to which the special project connection fee is applicable includes land that is to be subdivided or otherwise developed, the developer or subdivider of the property shall be responsible for payment of all applicable special project connection fees prior to connection of private sewers, public sewers, or building sewers to the village public sanitary sewer system.

2.  For calendar year 2007, the sanitary sewer fee shall be prorated to an amount equal to the proportion of the computed annual tax for the period from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section to that December 31, 2007, and shall constitute a lien on such real estate as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. 
3.  The owner of real property as of the date of connection to a sanitary sewer connected to the village's sanitary sewer system after January 1st in any year shall be liable for the sanitary sewer fee as determined by this section for the year in which the property is connected based on the prorated portion of the calendar year in which the property is connected, and such fee, together with penalty and interest and costs that may accrue thereon shall be a lien on such real property from and after the date of connection. 
B.  Definitions. As used in this section, the following words and terms shall have the meanings set forth herein: 
    "Billed water usage" means the average daily amount of water indicated as used by a taxable unit as determined from the records of the Illinois American Water Corporation or its successor for one selected actual or estimated water meter reading for such taxable unit during the months of November, December, January, February and March immediately preceding the statement date. 
    "Service unit" means any lot, tract or parcel of real property which has a sanitary sewer connected into a village of Savoy sanitary sewer for purposes of allowing discharge of water or waste from the real property. 
    "Statement date" means the date the charges made under this section are deposited in the United States mail by or on behalf of the village. 
    "Taxable unit" means any lot, tract or parcel having a building or structure, including a mobile home or modular home, which lot, tract or parcel has water metered service to any building or structure on such lot, tract or parcel, located in the village of Savoy or located outside the village but connected to the village sewerage system by agreement. 
C.  Taxable Unit Charge. Each taxable unit shall pay an amount based upon the billed water usage of such taxable unit and at the rate of one dollar and ten point twenty-six cents ($1.1026) per one hundred (100) cubic feet (one unit) of billed water usage. The amount may be amended annually on January 1st. An actual or estimated water meter usage may be adjusted by the treasurer to exclude water furnished to the taxable unit which was evaporated or bottled for shipment in a commercial or industrial operation; or, to an amount which more properly represents an average annual actual figure, upon presentation of factual evidence by the property owner. Responsibility for initiating this review and presentation of this factual evidence rests entirely with the property owner. This evidence must be presented to the treasurer prior to April 15th of each year to be included in the billing formula for that year. 
D.  Billing. 
1.  All billings shall be created in the name of and forwarded to the property owner as shown in the records of the supervisor of assessments at the time of the statement date. 
2.  Charges set forth herein for all units shall be computed and billed semiannually and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days from the statement date. In the event the statement of charges remains unpaid after thirty (30) days from the statement date, said charges shall then be delinquent and there shall be added thereto a late penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the amount of such bills for which payment remains delinquent and outstanding and interest shall be charged at the rate of one percent per month or part thereof on any amount remains delinquent and outstanding. 
3.  Charges may, at the option of the village, be billed on a monthly or two-month cycle, in which case bills are due within thirty (30) days from the statement date as aforesaid. 
4.  Whenever the billing period is for less than the full billing period as maintained by the village and charges for any portion of such period shall be prorated to the next period. 
5.  Bills rendered by the village for charges set forth in this section shall show thereon the name of the property owner, the permanent parcel number of the property for which charges are rendered, the basis or rate upon which the charges are made, the amount due, when and where payable, the period for which charge is made, and any additional information deemed necessary by the village for the village's purposes. 
6.  a.  The village may enter into an intergovernmental agreement ("Billing Agreement") with the Urbana-Champaign Sanitary District ("District") for the district to send bills to users of sanitary sewers for the village's sanitary sewer fee. 
b.  The village manager is authorized to execute addendums to any billing agreement which has been previously approved by the village trustees for the purpose of making the billing arrangements contained in the agreement more efficient or for the purpose of adjusting the fees paid by the village to the district. 
c.  To the extent that any provision of this article is superseded, amended, or changed by the terms of the billing agreement, then the provisions of this article shall not be effective or controlling while the billing agreement is in effect. 
d.  To the extent the adopted procedures of the sanitary sewer district contradict the provision of this article, the procedures in the agreement shall apply while the agreement is in force and effect. 
E.  Delinquent Charges. If a delinquency exists, the amount of penalty charges and the date of delinquency shall also be shown on the bill. 
1.  Whenever such charges become delinquent as set forth in subsection (D)(2) of this section, the same along with delinquent charges shall become and constitute a lien upon the real estate to which sewer service is supplied pursuant to the terms and provisions of Section 11-141-7 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-141-7), which can be foreclosed in the same manner and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate. 
2.  Statements rendered for such charge shall be deemed notice to the owner of the property served if such statement is mailed to the owner by U.S. mail in the manner required by this article. The claim for lien shall be made in the form of a sworn statement setting out: 
a.  A description of real estate, sufficient for the identification; 
b.  The amount or amounts of money due; and 
c.  The date or dates when such amount or amounts became delinquent. 
3.  In all cases where the charge has become delinquent to the village elects to file a statement thereof in the office or recorder of deeds as hereinabove set forth, there shall be added prior to recording in addition to the amount due the village such charges and expenses as are necessary and required to verify the legal description of the property to which the lien is to attach, plus the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) to reimburse the village for the cost of preparation of such notices and forms required. In each instance, the treasurer or a duly appointed and authorized employee of the village shall be authorized and directed to include such additional costs in the amount claimed due to the village in the notice of lien. 
4.  In the alternative, the village may in its discretion, file suit to collect such amounts as are delinquent and due against the owner of the real estate in a civil action, or file a complaint for a fine for violation of the ordinance. In addition it shall collect all costs incurred by the village and reasonable attorney fees fixed by the order of the court. 
5.  Failure to remit the sewer use benefit tax within thirty (30) days of the statement date shall constitute a violation of this section. Any owner found guilty of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting, or refusing to comply with the village's sewer use benefit tax, shall upon conviction be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation. 
6.  Application of Payments in the Event of Delinquency. Payment received for a service unit shall be applied first to any outstanding interest due on the sanitary sewer service unit and then to any outstanding current sanitary sewer fee for the service unit. Any payments in excess of the amount outstanding shall be credited to the service unit's future liability when it becomes due or, if requested by the owner of the service unit in writing, refunded to the owner. 
F.  Responsibilities of Property Owner and Village. The failure of any owner of property to receive a bill or statement for charges shall not be grounds for nonpayment or reason to extend or defer the date upon which payment is due or avoid the inclusion of penalties and interest. Owners of property which are subject to recording of the charge and are responsible for ascertaining from the village all amounts, if any, due as provided in this section. If it is shown that the village mailed the bill to an address other than is required under subsection C of this section, no late payment charges or additional penalties shall be assessed, if the charges are in fact paid within thirty (30) days after the village mails a correct statement of charges to the correct address. 
G.  Use of Funds. The treasurer of the village shall receive all revenues from charges set forth in this section, and deposit such revenues in the proper fund of the village. Revenues so deposited shall be disbursed as provided by ordinance. Provided, however, the funds collected under this section shall be used for sanitary sewer construction, repair and maintenance, and/or capital debt retirement including interest and engineering and legal costs associated with the sanitary sewer system of the village, and the costs to administer this section, and may also be used for construction and repair of storm drains to the extent that construction or repair of storm drains substantially and directly alleviates or corrects infiltration of stormwaters into the sanitary sewer system. 
H.  Access to Records. The village shall allow the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) or its authorized representative to have access to any applicable books, documents, paper and records of the sewer use fee for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions thereof to ensure compliance with the loan agreement terms and rules of any state loan. 
I.  Appeals. The method for determination of sanitary sewer fee charge in subsection C of this section shall be made available to a user within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a written request by the property owner. Any discrepancy over the method used or in the computations thereof shall be remedied by the village or his or her designee within thirty (30) days after notification of a formal written appeal outlining the discrepancies.

Sections: 

14.04.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the "Storm Water Control Ordinance of the village of Savoy, Champaign County, Illinois." 
(Ord. 831102 § 1) 
14.04.020 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to control the transportation or movement of storm water and reduce the damage to property and injury to persons and hazards to public health and safety occasioned thereby, and to protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources. Additionally the purpose of this chapter is to control soil erosion on land that is undergoing changes to existing grades by adding or removing or relocating dirt on-site for nonagricultural purposes and to preserve the natural terrain and waterways of land within the incorporated portions of the village. Soil erosion scars the land and creates sediment that clogs storm sewers and road ditches, chokes streams and creates silt lakes, all of which pose a threat to public health and safety. The provisions of this chapter are intended to provide a natural community environment, to prevent soil erosion and to reduce costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, water conveyance systems, roads and embankments. Application of the regulations in this chapter will effectively control soil erosion and sedimentation. Any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to change existing grades by adding, removing or relocating any dirt within the village of Savoy shall first apply to the zoning administrator and the village engineer for approval of required erosion control plans and issuance of any permits as specified in this chapter.

14.04.050 - General requirements. 
A.  Required Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan. Owners/operators of construction sites need to have National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage for discharges of storm water from construction sites where one or more acres of land will be disturbed. For sites less than one acre see subsections 14.04.050(B) and (C). Many permittees in Illinois obtain permit coverage for their construction projects under the state's general storm water NPDES permit for construction activities. In order for storm water discharges from construction sites to be authorized under this general permit, the owner must submit a notice of intent (NOI) in accordance with the requirements of the general permit. Permittees must develop and implement a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) to effectively prevent the discharge of pollutants from the site. The full general permit, and related information about the requirements for construction sites, is available from Illinois EPA at this web address: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/forms.html. 
    Construction activities can include utility construction/repair, subdivision construction including public and/or private infrastructure, road construction, construction of residential houses, office/commercial buildings, industrial sites, or demolition. 
    Land disturbance means exposed soil due to clearing, grading, or excavation activities. 
    Larger common plan of development or sale describes a situation in which multiple construction activities are occurring, or will occur, on a contiguous area. 
    An operator is the person or persons with either operational control of construction project plans and specifications, or day-to-day operational control of activities necessary to ensure compliance with IEPA storm water NPDES permit conditions. 
    (Under Phase I, operators were required to obtain permit coverage for construction activity that resulted in a total land disturbance of five acres or more or less than five acres if they were part of a "larger common plan of development or sale" with a planned land disturbance of five acres or greater. Phase II reduces that project size to one acre or more.) 
1.  Contents of Plan. Grading plans, site plans, preliminary plat of subdivision, or the subdivision improvement plans for grading land areas one acre or more in area shall include the following additional information:

xi.  Delineation of the 100-year flood plain and floodway. 
xii.  A statement from the property owner or his agent assuming full responsibility for the performance of the operation as stated in the application. This statement shall also contain assurance that all village property or roads will be adequately protected. 
b.  The proposed phasing of development of the site, including clearing, rough grading and construction, and final grading and landscaping. Phasing should identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas and the sequence of clearing, installation of temporary sediment control measures, installation of storm drainage, paving streets and parking areas, and establishment of temporary and permanent vegetative cover. The designated official may waive specific requirements for the content of submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to show that the work will comply with the objectives and principles of these regulations. 
2.  Additional Requirements of Plan. The sediment and erosion control plan must define the measures to be taken to meet erosion control principles and standards as defined in this chapter. The plan must ensure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten (10) years, twenty-four (24) hour frequency rainfall as published by the Illinois State Water Survey rainfall for this region less the allowable release rate. 
3.  Conservation District Comments. When a plan is submitted to the designated official, the plan shall also be submitted to the county soil and water conservation district. Such comments may pertain but need not be limited to: 
a.  Erosion and sedimentation control. 
b.  Soil use limitations. 
c.  Environmental considerations. 
B.  Principles and Standards. 
1.  All excavations, grading, or filling shall have a finished grade not to exceed a three to one (3:1) slope (thirty-three (33) percent). Steeper grades may be approved by the designated official if the excavation is through rock or the excavation or the fill is adequately protected (a designed head wall or toe wall may be required). Retaining walls that exceed a height of four feet shall require the construction of safety guards as identified in the appropriate sections of the adopted IBC codes and must be approved by the village building and zoning department. Permanent safety guards will be constructed in accordance with the appropriate section(s) of the adopted IBC codes. 
2.  Sediment and erosion control plans for sites that exceed one acre of grading shall provide for sediment or debris basins, silt traps or filters, staked straw bales or other approved measures to remove sediment from runoff waters, the design to be approved by the designated official. Temporary siltation control measures (structural) shall be maintained until vegetative cover is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. (Refer to appendix A.) 
3.  All lots less than one acre that are currently being constructed upon as commercial or residential or having fill dirt added, removed, or relocated from any site in preparation for construction or grade changes to the lot are required to take action to control silt runoff to the public right of way or private adjacent property as determined by the appropriate official. Failure to install and maintain appropriate siltation barriers to ease silt runoff will result in stop work orders until corrective action is taken. In addition, excessive siltation runoff from construction sites onto public streets will be cleaned by those responsible. If not cleaned up at the end of the day, the responsible party will be billed for overtime pay and any equipment costs. Where grade changes are made to existing vacant lots, no water runoff or silt runoff shall be directed to an adjacent property, and no natural water run off shall be altered to block or increase natural drainage. 
4.  Where natural vegetation is removed during grading, vegetation shall be reestablished in such a density as to prevent erosion. Permanent type grasses shall be established as soon as possible or during the next seeding period after grading has been completed. (Refer to appendix A.) 
5.  When grading operations are completed or suspended for more than thirty (30) days, permanent grass must be established at sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. Between permanent grass seeding periods, temporary cover shall be provided according to the designated official's recommendation. (Refer to appendix A.) All finished grades (areas not to be disturbed by future improvement) in excess of twenty (20) percent slopes (five to one (5:1)) shall be mulched and tacked at the rate of one hundred (100) pounds per one thousand (1,000) square feet when seeded. 
6.  Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after grading. Un-vegetated open channels shall be designed so that gradients result in velocities of two fps (feet per second) or less. Open channels with velocities more than two fps and less than five (5) fps shall be established in permanent vegetation by use of commercial erosion control blankets or lined with rock, riprap or concrete or other suitable materials as approved by the designated official. Detention basins, diversions, or other appropriate structures shall be constructed to prevent velocities above five fps. (Refer to Appendix B, in this chapter.) 
7.  The adjoining ground to development sites (lots) shall be provided with protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt from erosion, and any other consequences of erosion. Runoff water from developed areas (parking lots, paved sites and buildings) above the area to be developed shall be directed to diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters and/or underground outlet systems. Sufficiently anchored straw bales may be temporarily substituted with the approval of the designated official. (Refer to Appendix B, in this chapter.) 
8.  Development along natural watercourses shall have residential, commercial or industrial improvements, parking areas or driveways set back a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from the top of the existing stream bank. The watercourse shall be maintained and made the responsibility of the subdivision trustees or, in the case of a site plan, by the property owner. Permanent vegetation should be left intact. Variances will include designed stream bank erosion control measures and shall be approved by the designated official. FEMA and U.S. army corps of engineer's guidelines shall be followed where applicable regarding site development areas designated as flood plains and wetlands. 
9.  All lots shall be seeded and mulched at the rates defined in Appendix A of this chapter or sodded before an occupancy permit shall be issued; except, that a temporary occupancy permit may be issued by the building and zoning department in cases of undue hardship because of unfavorable ground conditions. 
C.  General Requirements. Except as may otherwise be provided herein, all structures erected hereafter, all uses of land or structures established hereafter, all improvements to water courses, all structural alterations or relocation of existing structures occurring hereafter, and all enlargements of or additions to existing uses occurring hereafter, located within the village, or within the jurisdictional area of the village, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
    Except as otherwise provided below, no building permit may be issued; no subdivision or plat of land may be approved or recorded; no mobilehome, independent travel trailer, or recreational travel trailer park permit may be issued; no planned community development may be approved; no development or planned unit development may be approved; no watercourse, storm water drainage system, storm sewer, or control structure may be constructed; and no paved or compacted area designed to be used for loading, open storage, or the parking or movement of vehicles may be constructed without first having complied with the provisions of this chapter and having obtained the approval of the administrator. 
    The following land use changes and types of construction or development are excluded from terms of this chapter: 
1.  Traditional agricultural land uses; 
2.  Single-family dwellings constructed on lots or parcel of land, which were of record on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter; 
3.  Modification of single-family dwellings which will continue to be used as single-family dwellings; 
4.  Modification of structure or appurtenances other than single-family dwellings, which do not increase the amount of impermeable area;

(Ord. No. 2012-15, § 4, 11-7-12) 
14.04.060 - Storm water control policy. 
    This chapter establishes storm water control policies for control of storm water runoff and development of storm water drainage facilities within the jurisdictional limits of the village. Accordingly, a combination of temporary storage and the controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required for all new commercial and industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned unit developments, and any redevelopment or other new construction. For this area, it is intended that the maximum controlled storm water release rate shall not exceed the natural safe storm water drainage capacity of the downstream storm water drainage system as defined by this chapter. 
    It is anticipated in this chapter that a land owner shall be allowed to pass through existing excess storm water runoff from tributary areas upstream from that owner's land without storage or controlled release of such runoff. It is further anticipated that this chapter will require the controlled release of excess storm water runoff resulting from development on owner's land. The controlled release rate of excess storm water runoff from an owner's land shall not exceed the rate of runoff which would have occurred from that owner's land prior to the development of that owner's land. It is presumed that prior to development, that owner's land had a traditional agricultural use. It is further presumed that the maximum safe storm water drainage capacity for downstream storm water drainage systems is the capacity required to carry a rate of storm water runoff from a five-year return period storm prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
(Ord. 831102 § 7) 
14.04.070 - Technical requirements. 
    The following requirements shall be applicable and shall be satisfied prior to the construction, improvement or development of any structure, project or land which is subject to the provisions of this chapter: 
A.  Maximum Release Rate. The maximum controlled release rate for each independent watershed area within the owner's land shall be determined in the following manner: 
1.  For that portion of the watershed outside of an owner's land, the peak rate of runoff which would have occurred for a five-year return period storm under the state of development existing just prior to application for development of an owner's land shall be calculated and determined. 
2.  For that portion of the watershed within the lands of an owner, the peak rate of runoff which would have occurred for a five-year return period storm under a state of traditional agricultural usage shall be calculated and determined. 
3.  The maximum controlled release rate for each independent watershed area within the owner's land as it exits the owner's land for storms up to and including the fifty (50) year return period storm shall be the sum of subsections (A)(1) and (A)(2) of this section. 
4.  The peak rate of runoff which would have occurred for a five-year return period storm shall be determined using the rational method or other substantial method acceptable to the village engineer. 
5.  The five-year and fifty (50) year return period storm shall be determined utilizing Technical Letter 13 of the Illinois State Water Survey, or the most recently available information. 
6.  In the event that the downstream storm water runoff drainage system is inadequate to accommodate the maximum release rate provided above, then the village, at its option, may reduce the allowable release rate to that rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving storm water runoff drainage system and additional storage as determined by the village engineer may be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving storm water runoff drainage system. When the village exercises this option, the owner and the village shall pay a proportional share of the costs of the storage, as mutually determined by the village and the owner. 
B.  Storm Sewer Systems. 
1.  Capacity. All storm sewer systems shall be designed for the peak rate of runoff from a minimum of a five-year return period storm.

d.  Extra strength vitrified clay pipe (with minimum of three feet cover.) 
    The strength requirements of the sewer pipe shall conform to the requirements of the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Illinois Department of Transportation. Engineer to verify the strength of the pipe used. 
9.  Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of storm sewers shall not be less stringent than those set forth in the latest edition of the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, by the Illinois Society of Professional engineers, et al, (latest edition). 
    Construction of any utility pipe or conduit such as gas, electric and water through any storm sewer structure shall be prohibited, except with approved conflict structures. 
C.  Surface Drainage Systems. Surface drainage will be permitted for storm water, where cost estimates show storm sewers are not economically feasible (including all life-cycle costs and the value of the land consumed), where land use conditions indicate this method is feasible, and where topographic conditions indicate there will be no difficulty from this method of disposal of storm waters. Such economic and feasibility studies shall be reviewed and approved by the village engineer. 
1.  Capacity. All surface drainage systems of storm water shall be designed for the peak rate of runoff from a minimum of a five-year return period storm. The five-year return period storm shall be determined utilizing Technical Letter 13 of the Illinois State Water Survey, or the most recently available information. The system shall have a free outlet. All design calculations must be submitted to the village engineer for approval. 
2.  Grade. Storm water surface drains shall be constructed with uniform bottom slopes along the entire length of the drains. Minimum and maximum allowable grade shall be those capable of producing velocities between 0.5 and 10.0 feet per second, respectively, when the surface drain is flowing full. In all cases, storm water velocity shall be controlled to eliminate problems of soil erosion or other damage which could detract from the primary use of the area. 
3.  Side Slopes and Bottom Widths. Surface drains shall be constructed having side slopes of not less than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, or flatter. Side slopes steeper than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical shall not be used without site-specific approval by the village engineer. A channel bottom width of not less than one foot shall be provided. 
4.  Erosion. Design of surface drains shall include control of soil erosion. Temporary seeding or other soil stabilization measures shall be utilized during construction to control erosion. Permanent erosion control measures such as mulching, hydroseeding, nurse crops, conventional seeding, or other similar measures shall be utilized upon completion of construction. These measures shall meet or exceed the standards established by the Champaign County Soil and Water Conservation District. 
5.  Culverts. Culverts and similar structures shall have a capacity which meets or exceeds the capacity of the surface drain, but shall be a minimum of twelve (12) inches in diameter. The flowline of a culvert shall match the flowline of the surface drain. Culverts shall meet or exceed the requirements of "An Ordinance to Regulate the Construction, Maintenance, or Replacement of driveways and driveway culvert pipes within the right-of-ways under the jurisdiction of the Village of Savoy" as amended. 
6.  Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of storm water surface drains shall equal or exceed those set forth in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Illinois Department of Transportation (latest edition) or shall be as otherwise approved by the village engineer. 
7.  Tile Drains. All major storm water surface drains as designated by the village engineer shall also be constructed with a subsurface drainage tile or tubing encased to the surface with Class "X" washed gravel as shown on the attached standard details. 
D.  Excess Storm Water Passageway. An excess storm water passageway shall be provided for the floodplains of all natural water courses and such manmade water courses and storm drainage systems as the village engineer may direct, which shall have adequate capacity to convey the excess storm water from the tributary watershed. The capacity of this excess storm water passageway shall be adequate to transport the peak rate of runoff from the fifty (50) year return period storm, assuming all upstream areas are fully developed for uses specifically permitted by existing zoning and antecedent rainfall has saturated the tributary watershed. The increase due to saturation shall be calculated by a ratio of the amount of runoff of the Antecedent Moisture Condition III to Antecedent Moisture Condition II of the twenty-four (24) hour fifty (50) year return frequency storm as outlined by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service for the tributary watershed. No structures shall be constructed within this passageway; however, streets, parking lots, playgrounds, park areas, pedestrian walkways, open green space, and utility and sewer easements shall be considered compatible uses. 
    Design of the excess storm water passageway shall include control of storm water velocity to eliminate problems of soil erosion or other damage which would detract from the primary use of the area. The entire area of any excess storm water passageway within the corporate limits of the village and one and one-half miles thereof shall be placed in a drainage easement or remain under the jurisdiction of the village, other governmental unit, or village-approved quasi-public agency (i.e., homeowner's association, etc.) In the event this passageway is reshaped or its capacity to transport excess storm water is otherwise restricted, the village may cause to have any restrictions removed at the expense of the agency, party, or parties causing or permitting these restrictions. Should a natural drain exist, it shall be preserved and used to the extent possible, as a part of the excess storm water passageway. Where it is necessary to reroute a natural drain, the rerouted drain shall have a capacity equivalent to or greater than that which existed in the natural drain and as otherwise required by this chapter. 
E.  Storm Water Storage. When the maximum controlled storm water runoff rate would be exceeded upon the development, redevelopment, or new construction on the owner's land, storm water storage methods shall be provided and constructed by the owner. Any one, or all of the storm water storage methods listed shall be provided and constructed. 
1.  General Requirements. 
a.  The volume of required storm water storage shall be calculated on the basis of the maximum value achieved from the runoff of a fifty (50) year return period storm less the volume of water released through the outlet structure. The fifty (50) year return period storm shall be determined utilizing Technical Letter 13 of the Illinois Water Survey, or the most recently available information. The method utilized for calculation of volume of storage shall be the soil conservation service method or any other substantial method acceptable to the village engineer. The release rate of the outlet structure when one-half of the storage volume is filled may be used in lieu of routing techniques in small drainage areas. The control structure shall be designed to maintain as uniform a flow as possible, independent of the storm water storage volume. Where the proposed structure, project, or land development forms only a portion of a watershed or contains portions of several watersheds, the storage volume calculations shall be based upon the area of the entire project, development, or land use change. 
b.  The storage of excess storm water runoff from a fifty (50) year return period storm having a duration of twenty-four (24) hours, released at the allowable rate, shall not result in a storage duration in excess of twenty-four (24) hours, but storage duration may be as long as forty-eight (48) hours upon site specific approval by the village engineer. All design calculations must be submitted to the village engineer for approval. 
c.  Each storm water storage area shall be provided with a method of overflow in the event a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. This overflow facility shall be constructed to function without special attention and can become a part of the excess storm water passageway described in subsection C of this section. 
d.  The entire storm water storage area shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety, and welfare. If a condition occurs in the storm water storage area which is hazardous to the public health, safety, or welfare, the person responsible for the condition will be required to provide approved corrective measures. In the event these corrective measures are not provided, the village may eliminate the hazard at the expense of the person responsible. 
2.  Dry Bottom Storm Water Storage. 
a.  Dry bottom storm water storage areas may be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space, or similar type of uses which will not be adversely affected by occasion intermittent flooding; 
b.  Minimum grades for turf areas shall be one-half percent (two hundred (200) units horizontal to one unit vertical) and maximum side slopes shall be twenty-five percent (25%) (four units horizontal to one unit vertical). Storage areas side slopes shall follow the natural land contours as closely as practicable, and a minimum of earth excavation shall be used to create the storage facility. Geometrics of dry bottom storm water storage areas shall be approved by the village engineer. 
c.  Temporary seeding or other soil stabilization measures shall be established in the storm water storage area and excess storm water passageway immediately following the construction or reconstruction of these areas. During the construction of the overall development, it is recognized that a limited amount of sediment buildup may occur in the storm water storage area due to erosion. In no case, shall the volume of the storage area be reduced to less than ninety percent (90%) of the required volume during the construction phase of the development. 
    Permanent erosion control measures such as mulching, hydroseeding, conventional seeding, nurse crops, fertilizing, or sod installation shall be utilized to control soil movement and erosion within the storage area and excess storm water passageway. These measures shall meet or exceed the standards established by the Champaign County Soil and Water Conservation District. The installation of these permanent measures shall take place only after the majority of construction and other silt and sediment producing activities have been completed. Prior to the establishment of the permanent erosion control measures, the required capacity of the storm water storage area and the excess storm water passageway shall be restored. 
d.  The control structure shall be provided with an interceptor for trash and debris, and it shall be designed and constructed to prevent soil erosion and not to require manual adjustments for its proper operation. The control structure shall be designed to operate properly with little or no maintenance and/or attention. The control structure shall be provided with safety screens for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from crawling into structures. The control structure shall be constructed to allow access to it at all times, including times of flood flow. 
e.  Adequate impact stilling basins shall be provided to ensure that downstream soil erosion is mitigated as much as practical and the regime of the downstream drain facility is not disturbed. 
f.  Low flow conduits or channels shall be provided in storm water storage areas; these conduits or channels shall be so constructed that they will not interfere with any secondary usage of the storage area and will reduce the frequency of time that the storage area will be covered with water. Low flow conduits shall facilitate complete interior drainage of the storm water storage area. 
g.  Pipe outlets of less than six inches in diameter shall not be allowed. Multiple outlets from a storm storage area shall be avoided if they are designed to be less than twelve (12) inches in diameter. 
h.  The maximum planned depth of storm water stored shall not exceed six feet. 
i.  Tile underdrains shall be provided in dry bottom storm water storage areas. These tile underdrains shall be so constructed that they will not interfere with any secondary usage of the storage area. Tile underdrains shall be so constructed so that they shall facilitate dewatering of the soils in the storm water storage area to avoid marshy or saturated soil conditions. Tile underdrains systems may be combined with the low flow conduits or channels system and shall be as approved by the village engineer. 
j.  Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn of deep water, possible flood conditions during storm periods and other dangers that exist. Fencing may be provided whenever side slopes are greater than four horizontal to one vertical. 
3.  Wet Bottom Storm Water Storage. Wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed in compliance with all the regulations which are applicable and govern the construction of dry bottom storm water storage areas. The following additional regulations shall apply: 
a.  The water surface area of the permanent pool shall not exceed one-tenth of the area of the tributary watershed, or as approved by the village engineer. 
b.  Protection of the shoreline must be provided to alleviate soil erosion due to wave action. 
c.  Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to be used to keep the pond clean, at least one-quarter of the pond area shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet deep. 
d.  Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. 
e.  The control structure for storm water release shall be designed to operate at full design release rate with only a small increase in water depth in order to minimize the land surface wetted by frequent minor storm water runoff conditions. 
f.  Measures shall be included in the design to prevent pond stagnation. This may be accomplished by aeration or some other method used to ensure aerobic pond conditions. 
g.  The volume of water permanently stored shall not be considered to be part of the required excess storm water storage volume. 
4.  Paved Storm Water Storage. Design and construction of the pavement base must insure that there is no pavement damage due to flooding. Control structures in paved areas must be readily accessible for maintenance and cleaning. Vortex control devices will be required. 
5.  Rooftop Storm Water Storage. Rooftop storage of excess storm water shall be designed and constructed to provide permanent control inlets and parapet walls to contain excess storm water. Adequate structural roof design must be provided to ensure that roof deflection does not occur which could cause the roofing material to fail and result in leakage. Overflow areas must be provided to ensure that the weight of stored storm water will never exceed the structural capacity of the roof. 
6.  Automobile Parking Lot Storage Areas. Automobile parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention storage on a portion of their surfaces. Automobile parking facilities used to store excess storm water must be constructed having a maximum depth of stored storm water of 0.5 feet; and these areas shall be located in the most remote, least used areas of the parking facility. Design and construction of automobile parking in storm water areas must insure that there is no damage to the parking facility due to flooding, including damage to the subbase. Warning signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn of possible flood conditions during storm periods. 
7.  Underground Storm Water Storage. Underground storm water storage facilities must be designed for easy access in order to remove accumulated sediment and debris. These facilities must be provided with a positive gravity outlet. 
8.  Storm water storage areas which will be filled to capacity by frequent storms shall be designed in a manner that will protect immediate downstream properties, and all overflow structures shall be designed to function properly and effectively without the necessity of making manual adjustments A larger outlet for a storm water storage area may be permitted by the administrator for the orderly management of storm water runoff where large tributary areas were developed without detention. 
9.  If the orderly management of the storm water runoff cannot be achieved by passing the entire tributary area runoff through the storm water storage area, then the storm water storage area may be constructed to exclude the runoff from the tributary area originating outside of the area to be developed. 
10.  Where the owner has a large tract of land upon which development is to occur in several phases, the owner may construct, upon site specific approval by the village engineer, one storm water storage facility which is designed to be enlarged at later dates as additional portions of the owner's lands are developed and as additional storm water storage is required due to that development. 
11.  Where portions of the owner's land are tributary to the same drain for an outlet, but which are within two or more tributary areas to that drain, the owner may construct, upon site specific approval by the village engineer, compensatory storm water detention facilities within one tributary area which offset the lack of construction of storm water detention facilities in another tributary area. Such compensatory storage shall be designed and constructed such that the net affect of these facilities shall be to limit the amount of storm water runoff released into the drain to that which would have occurred had storm water detention facilities been constructed for all the tributary areas. 
12.  Storm water storage areas may be planned and constructed jointly by two or more land owners so long as compliance with this chapter is maintained. 
13.  Where fringe portions of the owner's land are, in the opinion of the village engineer, difficult or impractical to drain to the detention facilities to be constructed for the rest of the property, the owner may apply for a variance of the requirements of this chapter. Such a variance may be granted for an area of land equal to up to two percent of the total property involved. In such cases, a variance may be granted without owner's proof of the avoidance of an unnecessary hardship and without specifically stating the public's interest in granting the variation. 
F.  Other Requirements. 
1.  Automobile parking lots and other land uses with significant portions of paved and roofed areas as determined by the village engineer shall be constructed with internal storm water runoff drainage systems. 
2.  Sump Pumps. Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge ground waters or storm water runoff shall be connected to the storm sewer where possible or discharged into a designated storm water runoff drainage facility. No discharge of storm water runoff or ground water by a sump pump into a sanitary sewer shall be allowed. No discharge of sanitary sewage into a storm drain shall be allowed. 
3.  No sump pump, footing drain, or downspout shall discharge onto a street surface, paved curb and gutter system, or public sidewalk. 
4.  Downspouts. Downspouts and roof drains shall discharge onto the ground or be connected to a storm drain. No downspouts or roof drains shall be connected to a sanitary sewer. 
5.  Footing Drains. Footing drains and drainage tile shall discharge into a storm sewer or other storm drainage facility. No footing drains or drainage tile shall be connected to a sanitary sewer. 
6.  Sump Pump Drains. Beginning on the effective date of this amendment (Ordinance 960306F) to the storm water control ordinance, any newly constructed or installed structure equipped with a sum pump and located on property, any part of which is within one hundred (100) feet of a sump drain line or storm sewer outlet, shall be required to connect to tie-in to such line or outlet. 
(Ord. 960306F § 1; Ord. 831102 § 8) 
14.04.080 - Administration. 
A.  Two copies of the detailed plans, specifications, and all calculations for the control of storm water runoff, as required by this chapter, shall be submitted to the administrator and one copy shall be submitted to the village engineer for review when making application for the platting of any lands or for a building permit or for any mobilehome park, independent travel trailer park, or recreational travel park permit or for any planned community development permit. The plans, specifications, and calculations shall be submitted to and approved by the administrator and the village engineer prior to the subdivision of any lands or the construction of any paved or compacted area designated to be used for loading, open storage, or the parking or movement of vehicles. The application shall be accompanied by an application fee in such amount(s) as may be determined by the board of trustees, from time to time, by motion, resolution or ordinance. Those exceptions found in Section 14.04.050 are excluded. Information data, and descriptive material prepared by a licensed professional engineer shall be submitted to the administrator and village engineer for review which show the following: 
1.  The extent and area of each watershed tributary to the drainage channels in the development; 
2.  The street storm sewers and other storm drains to be built, the basis of their design, outfall and outlet locations and elevations, receiving stream or channel and its high water elevation, and the functioning of the drains during high water conditions; 
3.  The parts of the proposed street system where pavements are planned to be depressed sufficiently to convey or temporarily store overflow from storm sewers and over-the-curb runoff resulting from the heavier rainstorms and the outlets for such overflow. Where storm water storage in street depressions is planned, curbs and gutters shall be provided and the maximum depth of water stored shall not exceed the height of the curb or six inches, whichever is less; 
4.  Existing streams and floodplains to be maintained, and new channels to be constructed, their locations, cross sections and profiles; 
5.  Proposed culverts and bridges to be built, their materials, elevations, waterway openings and basis of design; 
6.  Existing detention ponds and basins to be enlarged or otherwise altered and new ponds or basins to be built and the basis of their design; 
7.  The estimated location and percentage of impervious surfaces existing and expected to be constructed when the development is completed; 
8.  The slope, type, profile, typical cross section, and size of all sewers and other waterways; 
9.  A plan showing the dimensions of the site with existing and proposed structures properly located; 
10.  A topographic map of the site and such adjoining land whose topography may affect the drainage of the site, should the administrator so direct; 
11.  For all detention basins, a plot or tabulation of storage volumes with corresponding water surface elevations and of the basin outflow rates for those water surface elevations. If tabulations are provided, values of storage volume and overflow rate shall be listed for water surface elevation intervals of not exceeding 1.0 foot. 
B.  A plan for the responsibility for maintaining the storm water storage areas shall be submitted to and approved by the administrator prior to final approval. Acceptable plans for the maintenance of storm water storage areas may include agreements with units of local government or districts. Also acceptable would be agreements with individual property owners or property owners' associations, in which case the administrator may require that the face of the plat make reference to the agreement and that a restrictive covenant running with the land be imposed on all affected property. If a property owners' association is to be established, the developer of the project or subdivision or the applicant shall be responsible for its establishment and for informing the individual property owners of their responsibilities. 
    Acceptable methods of fixing the responsibility for maintaining storm water storage areas are not limited to those described above. 
C.  The facilities for the control of storm water runoff shall be constructed prior to the start of any construction or during the earliest possible stage of construction on the site of the project. All costs of construction, including the restoring, temporary seeding, and permanent erosion control measures, shall be borne by the contractor, applicant, or developer. The administrator shall approve the erosion control measures and the timing of their installation prior to their accomplishment. 
D.  The design and construction of a storm sewer, storm water storage area and any excess storm water passageway shall be under the supervision of an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer. He or she shall be responsible for all construction in accordance with the approved plans. The design engineer shall prepare and submit two sets of as-built plans to the administrator and one set to the village engineer for their approval upon completion of the construction of any storm water storage area, excess storm water passageway, storm sewer, and/or storm water drainage system. 
E.  All applications for building permits shall contain a statement that such buildings or structures and appurtenances connected therewith include facilities for the orderly runoff or detention of rain and melting snow, as required herein. Plans submitted with the application shall include a signed statement issued by an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer that the plans include facilities adequate to prevent harmful runoff, as required herein. For single-family dwellings to be located in a subdivision meeting the requirement of this chapter, the signed statement may, in lieu of the above procedure, be placed on the face of the final plat or the required subsidiary drainage plat for the entire subdivision. 
F.  A bond or other acceptable method of assurance in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated cost of all the construction required by this chapter as approved by the administrator shall be required prior to the start of any construction on the project. Proof of the assurance shall be given to the administrator for his or her records. 
G.  In the event that storm water runoff control can be provided exceeding the requirements of this chapter and the benefit of this additional control would accrue to the village at large, the village may participate in the increased cost of the control of storm water runoff in proportion to the additional benefits derived therefrom. 
H.  It shall be the sole responsibility of the developer and owner to obtain any required permits from other governmental agencies for the construction of any storm water drainage or detention facilities. 
I.  At the village's option, the village may require the owner to pay a proportionate share of the cost of correcting an existing adverse drainage condition or to share in the cost of construction of drainage facilities which exceed the normal site requirements for the development, when the village finds that additional development in the drainage basin would create an immediate or potential effect upon the village's existing drainage system and where the condition is correctable in a reasonable time span. The proportionate share of the cost of such facilities shall be mutually determined by the owner and the village. 
J.  The owner shall pay the total cost of the installation of all storm water drainage or retention facilities. When developments occur which are tributary to a drainage system which has been previously enlarged by the village, the owner shall pay appropriate tap on charges to the village, the cost of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the owner and the village. 
(Ord. 2002-30 § 1(6)(a); Ord. 831102 § 9) 
14.04.090 - Cross connection between storm sewer and sanitary sewer prohibited. 
    It is illegal and a violation of this chapter for any person, firm or corporation to allow or cause any cross connection between any storm sewer line within the village with any sanitary sewer line within the village, which violation shall be punishable in accordance with the general penalty provisions of the village ordinances, be subject to injunctive relief, and, to the extent consistent with applicable law, be subject to the village's immediate action to block or sever such illegal cross connection, if the public health is significantly jeopardized by such illegal connection.

c.  If a message is changed electronically, it must be accomplished within an interval of three seconds or less. 
Footnotes: 
(1)  All existing signs within zones 3 and 4 shall be allowed to remain as nonconforming uses. No sign shall be converted, enlarged or structurally altered unless its use is a conforming use or the use is changed to a conforming use. 
(Ord. 2004-20 § 2: Ord. 980902B § 5.5)

D.  Except as otherwise provided, the zoning administrator may remove or cause to be removed a portion of a sign or O.A.S.S. immediately and without notice, if and only if, in his or her opinion, the condition of that portion is such as to present an immediate and imminent threat to the safety of the public. The expenses of such removal shall be charged to the owner of the premises on which the sign or O.A.S.S. was located.

6.  The license applicant must sign an acknowledgment of the indemnity, hold harmless and release provisions of his license on his license application, license or other document.

5.  The location of the fence is not within a flood plain. 
6.  The requested fence must be located and configured so it will not impact usage of Lot 583 and its public drainage and utility easements. 
7.  The requested fence license, if granted, would not in any way constitute a public nuisance. 
8.  The required fence license, if granted, would not endanger the public health, safety or welfare. 
9.  This encroach-able area shall remain as public commons area under the ownership of the subdivision developer or subdivision homeowners association. 
10.  No accessory structure, play structure, swimming pool, signs, patio or deck privacy fencing or screening, landscaping that would obstruct the line of sight from adjacent neighboring properties including trees, bushes, ornamental grasses or gardens, shall be allowed within the encroach-able area. 
11.  All structures must comply with village ordinances and shall not be placed, planted or erected beyond the platted rear lot line and are subject to the provisions of Section 17.16.030, Table A and Section 17.16.040(B)(3) of the Savoy Municipal Code. 
12.  The provisions of this section shall apply to any other similar situated properties, to the Liberty on the Lake properties identified here, which are similarly situated with respect to their fences, encroaching fences or prospective encroaching fences upon a utility easement, and subdivision commons, drainage easement and the contiguous public properties. 
13.  Applicability. 
a.  This section shall apply to lot owners who have no encroaching fence, but request a license for such fence; and 
b.  This section shall also apply to lot owners who presently have encroaching fences more than five feet from the outside fence edge and wish to obtain a license to continue usage of such fence; and 
c.  This section shall also apply to lot owners who presently have encroaching fences less than five feet from the outside the sidewalk trail edge, who are required to move their encroaching fences back to a location at least five feet from the outside edge of said sidewalk trail.

16.12.050 - Procedures for review. 
A.  Subdivision. A preapplication conference may be requested by all subdividers prior to initial plat applications. Subdividers may contact the chairperson of the planning commission to arrange a preapplication conference. Subdividers may submit an area general plan at this stage with material sufficient to identify the tract and establish the relationship of the proposed development with surrounding area. 
B.  Processing. Upon request for a preapplication conference, the chairperson of the planning commission shall schedule the preapplication conference at the next regular meeting of the planning commission. All materials will be considered as submitted for informal discussion. Discussions will involve the proposals in compliance with these regulations, determination of the scope of the proposed subdivision, an outline of the procedures for the recording of plats and general information exchange. No approvals will result from this conference; however, the planning commission may make recommendations on the scope of the initial plat application by the subdivider, continuity of the proposed street pattern with existing or proposed street adjacent to the proposed subdivision, and other factors based on peculiarities of the area in which the subdivision is proposed. 
C.  Review. Review of any material submitted by the subdivider during the informal discussion phase shall be made by the planning commission. Any sketch plan submitted, shall be studied with regard to the best principles of land subdividing and development; to lot sizes, and proportions; to existing and planned land uses; to topography and drainage; to provisions for recreation areas, public open space, schools, parks and other public facilities; to design and location of streets; and to conformity with the continuity of existing street systems, walkways and related matters. 
D.  Inspection. The planning commission may make an inspection of the site to determine its relationship to and effect upon major thoroughfares, utility systems, and adjacent land uses (existing and planned) and ascertain the existence of any unusual problems; and shall determine: 
1.  The conformity of the proposed development to existing zoning regulations, official road maps, and municipal development plans and policies;

16.12.120 - Procedures for resubdividing and replatting recorded lots and for vacation of plats. 
    All regulations, procedures and standards made applicable herein to original subdividing shall also apply to the resubdividing and replatting of a plat or parts thereof; as provided by these regulations. 
A.  Procedure for Resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan legally recorded prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivision, such parcel shall be approved by the planning commission and village board of trustees by the same procedure, rules and regulations as for review and approval of a subdivision, or if the subdivision is classified as a minor subdivision, under the procedures as set forth in Section 16.12.140 for review and approval of a minor subdivision. 
B.  Procedure for Subdivisions where Future Resubdivision is Indicated. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the planning commission and village board of trustees may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat. 
C.  Vacation of Plats. Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same to be vacated. 
    Such an instrument shall be approved by the planning commission and the village board of trustees in like manner as plats of subdivisions. The governing body may reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets, or alleys. 
    Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and recorded and filed, in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alley, and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such plat. 
    When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of such writing.

D.  These principal uses listed in subsection B of this section which are permitted by right in the C-3 zoning district shall be permitted by right in a shopping center if the requirements of this section are met. 
    Principal uses requiring a special use in the C-3 zoning district shall similarly require a special use permit in a shopping center. 
    A shopping center shall be an authorized principal use in the C-3 zoning district. 
    A shopping center is permitted in the C-2 district if, and only if, a special use permit therefor is granted under the terms of this zoning ordinance. 
    Although the terms of other sections of this title allow one principal use per lot, more than one principal use per lot shall be permitted in a shopping center in accordance with the terms of this sections. No special use permit is required for such multiple uses on one lot in the C-3 district unless any of the principal uses involved require special uses under the zoning ordinance as set forth in Table in Section 17.16.020, Table of Authorized Principal Uses. 
    Multiple principal uses in the C-2 district for shopping center purposes do require a special use permit as a shopping center is allowed in the C-2 district only by special use permit.

Such site plan shall be reviewed by the planning commission which shall make a recommendation to the village board of trustees regarding the issuance of building permit(s) pursuant to the site plan. Only the board of trustees has the authority to authorize issuance of building permit(s) pursuant to the site plan. The board of trustees may at its discretion decline to authorize issuance of such building permit(s) if it determines that the public health, safety and welfare is not served by the requested permit(s). 
    If a shopping center business(es) designated in Table in Section 17.16.020, Table of Authorized Principal Uses, indicates that such business(es) requires a special use permit, the shopping center's approval shall be contingent upon issuance of such special use permit.

17.16.040 - Height and area standards and exceptions. 
A.  Chimneys, Towers, Etc. Chimneys, towers, elevator bulkheads, stacks, tanks, spires, steeples, antennae for the reception of radio and television, necessary mechanical devices and equipment appurtenant to the principal use of a building, and the housing for such devices and equipment, shall not be included as a part of the building in determining the height of the building. However, such devices and equipment are subject to University of Illinois-Willard Airport clear zones approach surfaces according to University, Division of Aeronautics and Federal Aviation Regulations. 
B.  Encroachments on Yards. Unless otherwise provided in this title, no building or structure, or portion of any building or structure, shall be erected in, occupy or obstruct a required yard except as follows: 
1.  In required front yards: 
a.  Private driveways, walks, fences, underground structures, flag poles, decorative lights, bird baths, bird houses, utility-owned apparatus and the like; 
b.  The ordinary projection of sills, cornices, fascias, moldings, chimneys, flues and ornamental features, when such projection is less than twenty-four (24) inches; 
c.  Portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete or all-weather surfaces, when the surface is so located or constructed that an automobile cannot be driven upon it from a driveway, parking space, street or alley and the surface shall not project more than six inches above the surface of the surrounding ground, except that parking may be allowed in some districts in accordance with Section 17.28.040;

d.  Uncovered patios located a minimum of five feet from any lot line or utility easement. 
e.  In the C-1, C-2 and C-3 zoning districts, when not subject to the buffer strip provisions of this title, Portland cement, concrete, asphaltic concrete or all-weather surfaces, when such surfaces are to be utilized for parking, shall conform to the requirements of Chapter 17.28 and shall be located not less than five feet from any side or rear lot line with no allowance for vehicle overhang. 
3.  In required rear yards: 
a.  Private driveways, walks, fences, underground structures, flag poles, decorative lights, bird baths, bird houses, utility owned apparatus and the like; 
b.  The ordinary projection of sills, cornices, fascias, moldings, chimneys, flues and ornamental features, when such projection is less than twenty-four (24) inches;

4.  In all required yards: 
a.  In all required yards of shopping center usage within C-3 community commercial district, the planning commission may at its discretion permit pavement for parking or ingress/egress purposes up to or over the lot line. Such allowances will be considered on a case-to-case basis following a site plan review. Any pavement which crosses or covers any utility easement shall be installed at the risk of the owner; 
b.  All lots adjacent to public streets or alleys are, however, required to provide a minimum five-foot green area setback on the lot sides fronting or abutting any streets or alleys; 
c.  Parking on any required yards on lots of shopping center usage within a C-3 community commercial district or within the side yard(s) of an I-3, railroad industrial district may be allowed in accordance with subsection (B)(4) of this section. 
C.  Location and Height of Accessory Buildings or Structures. 
1.  In any district, accessory buildings or structures, whether attached or detached from the principal building or structure may be erected in any space other than a required yard. The limiting height under these conditions shall be that of the applicable district in which the accessory building or structure is located. (See Chapter 17.26 for additional information regarding accessory buildings and uses.) 
2.  In a residential district, no accessory building shall exceed fifteen (15) feet in height and no accessory structure except those less than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area shall be located less than five feet from any rear or side lot line or less than five feet from any adjacent utility or drainage easement, whichever is greater. 
3.  Flagpoles in residential districts shall be not more than twenty-five (25) feet in height. Flagpoles in all other districts shall be not more than thirty-five (35) feet in height. 
D.  Lots Abutting on, or Adjoining Alleys. When the rear of a lot abuts upon a public alley, then one-half of the alley may be considered as a portion of the rear yard in the computation of the required rear yard. When the side of a lot adjoins a public alley and a building on the lot is required to have a wider side yard because it exceeds forty-five (45) feet in height, then one-half the alley may be considered as a portion of the side yard in the computation of the additional side yard requirements. 
E.  Front and Side Yard Exceptions. Whenever a dwelling is being erected, converted, enlarged or structurally altered and two or more lots constituting forty percent (40%) or more of the frontage on the same side of the street and in the same block as the dwelling proposed to be erected, converted, enlarged or structurally altered are occupied by dwellings, then the front yard requirements for the lot upon which the dwelling is to be erected, converted, enlarged or structurally altered shall be modified as follows: 
1.  When the difference between the depth of the deepest and the shallowest front yards of the lots occupied by dwellings is ten (10) feet or less, then the required front yard shall be the average depth of the front yards of all such lots occupied by dwellings. 
2.  When the difference between the depth of the deepest and the shallowest front yards of the lots occupied by dwellings is greater than ten (10) feet and a dwelling is situated on each side of and within one hundred (100) feet of the lot, then the required front yard shall be the average depth of the front yards of the two adjoining lots occupied by the dwellings. 
3.  When the difference between the depth of the deepest and the shallowest front yards of the lots occupied by dwellings is greater than ten (10) feet and a dwelling is situated on one side of and within one hundred (100) feet of the lot, but not on the other side, then the required front yard shall be the same as the depth of the front yard of the adjoining lot occupied by the dwelling. 
4.  When the difference between the depth of the deepest and the shallowest front yards of the lots occupied by dwellings is greater than ten (10) feet and no dwellings are situated on the adjacent lots, then the required front yard shall be the average depth of the front yards of all lots occupied by dwellings. 
    This regulation shall not be interpreted to require a front yard in excess of forty (40) feet under any circumstances. 
    The foregoing modifications of the front yard requirements shall also apply to the required yard on the street sides of a corner lot, but shall not be interpreted to require a side yard in excess of twenty (20) feet, or be interpreted to reduce the buildable width of a platted lot or tract to less than thirty-four (34) feet, if the lot or tract was of public record on the date this title became effective as to such lot or tract. Under unusual circumstances the planning commission may recommend that any or all portions of the requirements of this subsection be waived. 
F.  Service Stations. No service station building may be erected within twenty-five (25) feet of any street line. No gasoline pump, island for gasoline pumps or other service structure or facility may be erected within fifteen (15) feet of any street line. Access driveways and service driveways for service stations may be constructed in a required front yard and in a required side yard on the street side of a corner lot. Service stations are exempt from the rear yard regulations of the district in which they are permitted, but the side yard regulations of the districts shall be applicable to the rear yards of service stations, provided however, that the exception contained in Chapter 17.22 shall not apply to the rear yards of service stations. No service facilities of any nature shall be located in a required yard except as stated above. A required yard on a lot occupied by a service station may not be used for the storage of supplies, equipment or merchandise or the parking of automobiles. 
G.  Automobile Laundry or Car Wash. No building which is within twenty-five (25) feet of a street line may be used as an automobile laundry or car wash, unless such use is merely accessory to another principal use, or unless off-street parking facilities are provided between the access street or streets and the main entrance to the building, sufficient to accommodate one automobile for each automobile which can be accommodated within the building. 
H.  Triangular Lots. The front and side yard regulations shall apply to three-sided lots (hereinafter referred to as "triangular lots"). If a triangular lot is bounded by two streets, then the lot line of the street side having the least frontage dimension shall be considered to be the front lot line. If a triangular lot is bounded by three streets, the owner may designate the lot line to be considered as the front lot line. The rear yard regulations shall not apply to triangular lots. 
I.  Lot Fronting on Two Nonintersecting Streets. If a lot fronts on two nonintersecting streets, the front yard regulations shall apply to both frontages, and the lot shall be exempted from the rear yard regulations. 
J.  Federal Aviation Administration Restrictions. The approach and zoning plan, as required by the Federal Aviation Administration obstruction criteria for the University of Illinois-Willard Airport, a copy of which is on file with the Champaign County board, shall be consulted whenever doubt exists as to structure height. Prior to the issuance of a building permit in such cases, approval by the Federal Aviation Administration or its agent(s) shall be filed with the village clerk. Notice of request for exceptions to height restrictions shall be given to the Director, Institute of Aviation, University of Illinois-Willard Airport, Savoy, Illinois 61874. 
K.  In cases where a cul-de-sac radius is less than sixty (60) feet, the lot width minimum for lots fronting on the cul-de-sac may be reduced one foot for every one foot less than sixty (60) feet in cul-de-sac radius. In no case, however, shall the lot width be less than sixty (60) feet. Lot width measurement shall be as defined in Section 17.04.020. 
(Ord. 2008-17 § 1 Exh. A (part); Ord. 2000-06-07A § 5.4; Ord. 950201A; Ord. 910605A; Ord. 850703B) 
17.16.050 - Buffer strip. 
A.  A buffer strip is required along the lot line of a developed industrially zoned (I-1 or I-2) lot which is adjacent to any nonindustrially zoned lot. The buffer strip must be at least twenty-five (25) feet wide and contain screen planting along its length. Within the I-3 district, the need for a buffer shall be determined on a case-by-case, site-specific basis. In making this determination, both present and anticipated future adjoining land uses and zoning districts shall be considered. 
B.  A buffer strip is required along the lot lines of a developed commercially zoned (C-2 or C-3) lot which is adjacent to any non-commercially zoned lot except lots with Industrial (I-1 or I-2) zoning. The buffer strip must be at least fifteen (15) feet wide and contain screen planting along its length. 
C.  A buffer strip of at least twenty (20) feet in width is required along the lot lines of developed multiple-family residence (R-3, R-4 and R-5) zoned lots when they are adjacent to lots with one or two-family residence (R-1, R-2 or R-2A) zoning. 
D.  A buffer strip is required along the lot line of developed office/research zoned lots adjacent to any non-office/research or industrially zoned lot. The buffer strip must be at least twenty-five (25) feet wide and contain screen planting along its length. 
E.  Buffer strips are required only along the specified lot lines which separate areas of different character zoning. No buffer strip is required along lot lines adjacent to agricultural districts. 
(Ord. 2000-06-07A § 5.6; Ord. 950201A; Ord. 891101C) 
17.16.060 - C-1 district special setback requirements. 
A.  Front Setback. There shall be a front setback from the right-of-way line of not less than fifteen (15) feet, except that no front setback shall be required in those instances in which all of the frontage on one side of the street between two street intersections is classified for other than residential uses. If a lot fronts on two non-intersecting streets, the front setback regulations shall apply to both frontages. 
B.  Side Yard. There shall be a side yard on each side of the lot of not less than ten percent (10%) of the width of the lot, or eight feet, whichever is the smaller; otherwise no side yard is required, except the side yard on the street side of a corner lot shall be not less than fifteen (15) feet and a lot adjoining a residential district shall have a side yard on the side of the lot adjoining the residential district of not less than five feet. This regulation shall not be interpreted to require a side yard on the street side of a corner lot if no front yard would be required if the frontage were reversed. 
C.  Rear Yard. There shall be a rear yard of not less than twenty percent (20%) of the depth of the lot, or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is the smaller.

Sections: 

17.20.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The general purpose of a planned unit development is as follows: 
A.  To promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification in the location of structures while allowing a creative and imaginative approach to the use of land and physical facilities. 
B.  To provide for usable and suitably located recreational facilities and other public and common facilities which represent the quality of planning most desirable as designated in the village comprehensive plan and to provide additional amenities, design concepts and site plans that would not otherwise be required under conventional zoning. 
C.  To encourage a land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort and welfare. 
D.  To promote a creative and imaginative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in coordination of building styles and forms and nontraditional mixes of land use in a coordinated fashion. 
E.  To encourage a pattern of development which is better able to preserve natural site qualities and provide urban amenities of a higher quality than is possible under more traditional zoning and development regulations. 
F.  To allow mixed uses. 
G.  Take advantage of compact building design. 
H.  Utilize infill development and promote the redevelopment potential of underutilized sites within the village. 
I.  Use building styles and architectural styles that are distinctive to the village of Savoy fostering a distinct and attractive community with a strong sense of community. 
J.  Incorporate environmentally sensitive developments.

    "Anemometer" means A temporary wind speed indicator constructed for the purpose of analyzing the potential for utilizing a wind energy system at a given site. The temporary tower shall be permitted for a period of eighteen (18) months, which can be extended an additional eighteen (18) months by the board of trustees providing additional evidence is needed to determine proper siting for a tower. 
    "Ambient sound" means the all-encompassing sound at a given location, usually a composite of sounds from many sources near and far. For the purpose of this chapter, the "ambient sound level shall mean the quietest of 10-second average sound levels (quiescent background level) measured when there are no nearby or distinctly audible sound sources. Daytime ambient measurements should be made during mid-morning weekday hours, while nighttime measurements should be made after midnight. 
    "Building mounted wind energy systems" means a building mounted wind-generating system intended to generate power for on-site use. 
    "dB(A)" means the sound pressure levels in decibels. Refers to the "A" weighted scale defined by ANSI, a method for weighting the frequency spectrum to mimic the human ear. 
    "Horizontal-axis wind turbines" means a wind turbine in which the rotor is mounted horizontally. 
    "Large wind turbines" means turbines that generate more than one hundred (100) kW and are only suited for large wind farms. 
    "On-site tower mounted wind energy systems" means free standing wind-generating systems (horizontal or vertical axis) intended to generate electrical power which has a rated capacity of not more than five kW and is intended for on-site use. 
    "Operator" means shall mean those who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the wind energy system. 
    "Rotor" means the rotating part of a wind turbine, including the blades and blade assembly, and the rotating portion of the generator. 
    "Rotor diameter" means the diameter of the circle swept by the rotor. For measurements purposes the distance from the outer-most tip of the blade to the center of the turbine rotor multiplied by two. 
    "Shadow flicker" means a repetitive oscillation of light and shadow cast when light passes through and is interrupted by moving wind turbine blades. 
    "Small wind turbines" means turbines that are rated one hundred (100) kW or less. Most residential turbines are rated up to ten (10) to twenty (20) kW. Depending on the wind, a ten (10) kW turbine can generate enough electricity for residential applications. 
    "Sound level" means the a weighted sound pressure level in decibels (dB) (or the C weighted level if specified) as measured using a sound level meter that meets the requirements of a type-2 or better precision instrument according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)) S1.4. The "average" sound level is time-averaged over a suitable period using an integrating sound level meter that meets the requirements of ANSI S12.43 
    "Utility tower-mounted wind energy systems" means a utility tower-mounted wind energy system may generate electric power for on-site use or generate electrical power for off-site use. A system may be considered a utility tower-mounted system if it exceeds the standards of an on-site tower-mounted system or is a grouping of systems, maintained by one entity, which is intended to generate power to be transferred to a transmission system for distribution to consumers. (These systems should not be allowed within one thousand (1,000) feet of any residential use/district). 
    "Vertical-axis wind turbines" means a wind turbine in which the rotor is mounted vertically. 
    "Wind energy system" means wind energy systems, sometimes known as wind energy conversion systems, shall mean an electrical generating facility, whose main purpose is to supply wind -generated electricity, consisting of one or more wind turbines and other accessory structures and buildings, including all supported components, including base and foundation, blade, generator, rotor, tower, substations, meteorological towers, electrical infrastructure, transmission lines and other structures and facilities. 
    "Wind site assessment" means an assessment to determine the wind speeds at a specific site and the feasibility of using that site for the construction of a wind energy system.

Sections: 

17.32.010 - Continuation of nonconforming use. 
    Any use of a building or land lawfully existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or lawfully existing at the time said ordinance becomes effective as to such building or land, but which does not conform with the use regulations of the district in which the building or land is situated, may be continued under the regulations of this section, but this section shall not be interpreted as authorizing the continuation of any use of a building or land which was not lawfully existing on the effective date of said ordinance or lawfully existing on the date said title became effective as to such building or land. 
    If a building or land hereafter becomes subject to the provisions of this title, whether by annexation to the village or otherwise, and the use of the building or land at the time it becomes subject to the provisions of this title is lawful, but does not conform with the use regulations of the district in which the building or land is situated, such use shall be considered to be a lawful use which may continue as a nonconforming use under the provisions of this section. 
    No use of a building or land which neither conforms with the use regulations of the district in which the building or land is situated nor qualifies as an authorized nonconforming use under the provisions of this section shall not be considered to be a lawful use or be permitted to continue under the provisions of this title. 
    No use of a building which conforms with the use regulations of the district in which the building is situated shall be considered to be nonconforming merely because the building which is occupied by the use does not comply with the height regulations of the district in which the building is situated or because the building is so located on the lot that it does not comply with the yard regulations of such district. 
    The regulations of this chapter pertaining to a building occupied by a nonconforming use shall apply not only to a building which is completely occupied by such a use but shall also apply to one in which the nonconforming use occupies only a portion of the building. 
(Ord. 2000-06-07A § 9.1) 
17.32.020 - Change of nonconforming use. 
    A nonconforming use of a building or land may be changed to another nonconforming use if the classification of the new use is equal to or more restricted than the classification of the former use and the parking regulations applicable to the new use are fully met. If a building is occupied by a nonconforming commercial or industrial use and such use is changed to another use of equal or more restricted classification, then the building may be converted or structurally altered but not enlarged, for such use. If a building is occupied by a nonconforming dwelling, then the building shall thereafter be subject to the regulations of this section governing nonconforming dwellings. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a more restricted classification, then the use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. 
(Ord. 2000-06-07A § 9.2) 
17.32.030 - Extension or expansion of nonconforming use. 
    No nonconforming use occupying a portion of a building shall be extended or expanded into any other portion of the building. No building occupied by a nonconforming use may be enlarged unless the use is changed to a conforming use. No nonconforming use of land shall be extended or expanded.

    If a main building, other than a dwelling, is hereafter occupied by a lawful use or by a conforming use and such use thereafter becomes nonconforming, then such use shall be terminated within forty (40) years after the date of the completion of the building or the date of completion of the last substantial conversion, enlargement or structural alteration of the building, or within twenty (20) years after the use becomes nonconforming, whichever is the later. 
    A building shall be deemed to have been completed at the time the building, or any portion of the building, was originally occupied by a use. A substantial conversion, enlargement or structural alteration shall be deemed to have taken place only if no portion of the building was occupied by a use during the conversion, enlargement or structural alteration. The conversion, enlargement or structural alteration shall be deemed to have been completed when the building, or any portion of the building, was first occupied by a use after the commencement of the conversion, enlargement or structural alteration. 
    If any building occupied by an unlawful or nonconforming use has heretofore been or is hereafter converted, enlarged or structurally altered for such a use, then such conversion, enlargement or structural alteration, even though substantial in character, shall not have the effect of postponing the time for the termination of the nonconforming use. 
    The nonconforming use of a building for dwelling purposes is not subject to the provisions of this section, and such use may continue until it is discontinued or abandoned or until the building is damaged by fire, explosion or act of nature, and the cost of reconstructing the building will amount to more than fifty percent (50%) of its value immediately prior to the occurrence. 
(Ord. 2000-06-07A § 9.8) 
17.32.090 - Reconstruction of building occupied by nonconforming use. 
    If a dwelling is damaged by fire, explosion or act of nature and the cost of reconstructing the building will amount to more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the building immediately prior to the occurrence as calculated from fair market value, then the building shall not be reconstructed unless its use is a conforming use, or the use is changed to a conforming use, or the board of appeals authorizes the reconstruction of the building under the authority granted by Section 17.36.120, Variations permitted by this title. If a building other than a dwelling is occupied by a nonconforming use and the building is damaged by fire, explosion or act of nature, the building may be reconstructed if the applicable parking regulations are fully met, but the reconstruction, even though substantial in character, shall not have the effect of postponing the time for the termination of the nonconforming use. Architectural/aesthetic control requirements, as set forth in Section 17.12.090(C), shall apply to any change of, or to, a conforming use.

C.  The construction of required off-street parking facilities in a required side yard when the side yard in which such facilities are proposed to be situated adjoins the side yard of a lot occupied by multiple-family dwelling in an R-3, R-4, R-5 or C-1, C-2, C-3 district; 
D.  The construction of an accessory building or structure on a triangular lot or on a lot fronting on two non-intersecting streets;
