PREFACE 
The Rohnert Park, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 25, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance Number 922, passed April 24, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 25, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 25, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 25, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 25, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 25, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

Except in cases of emergency wherein the public health or safety is immediately threatened, no entry in or upon any private property shall be made unless the property owner has received personal notice either by the written notice above specified or by personal oral notice accompanied by written notice at the time of the inspection, that the property owner has the right to refuse entry if he so desires and the extent of his rights and duties if inspection is refused. In the event the owner and/or occupant refuses entry after such request has been made, the official is empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry. 
(Ord. 254 § 2, 1975)  
Chapter 1.16 - GENERAL PENALTY 
Sections: 
 
1.16.010 - General penalty. 
Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of the ordinances of the city is guilty of an infraction, unless the violation is specifically identified in this code as a misdemeanor. 
A.  Infractions. An infraction is punishable by: 
(1)  A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for a first violation; 
(2)  A fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for a second violation of the same code provision within a twelve-month period; 
(3)  A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for each additional violation of the same code provision within a twelve-month period. 
(4)  An offense, which would otherwise be an infraction, is a misdemeanor if a person has been convicted of three or more violations of the same code provision within a twelve-month period. For the purpose of this subsection, a bail forfeiture is considered a conviction of the offense charged. 
(5)  An infraction is not punishable by imprisonment. A person charged with an infraction is not entitled to a jury trial nor to a public defense unless arrested and not released. 
B.  Misdemeanors. A person who violates a provision of this code, or who fails to comply with a requirement of this code, is guilty of a misdemeanor if the violation is specifically identified in this code as a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor is punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both.

(1)  The violator identifies himself or herself to the arresting officer, produces government-issued identification to the arresting officer and the arresting officer is able to verify the authenticity of such identification; or 
(2)  The violator ceases or otherwise abates the violation after receiving notice of such violation; or 
(3)  The violator has not previously been convicted of violating the same provision of this code within two years of the currently charged violation; or 
(4)  There is no need to book the violator. 
(Ord. 743 § 1, 2005: Ord. 255 § 1, 1975)  
1.16.020 - AdditionalAlternative remedy. 
In addition to or in lieu of the remedies provided in the preceding Section 1.16.010, General penalty, the city attorney may commence an action for abatement, including, but not limited to, an injunction thereof, in the manner required by law and shall take such other steps to obtain such relief as will abate or remove a violation and restrain an enjoin any person from violating any provisions of this code, or other applicable laws and rules and regulations. All costs, including attorney's fees, for the abatement of a violation of this code which constitutes a public nuisance is assessed against any property declared to be a public nuisance and the costs, including attorney's fees, shall be collected in the manner provided for by Government Code Section 38773.5. 
(Ord. 680 § 1, 2002)  
Chapter 1.20 - ARREST PROCEDURE 
Sections: 
 
1.20.010 - ArrestNotice. 
A.  If any person is arrested for a violation of any ordinance of the city and such person is not immediately taken before a magistrate pursuant to Part 2 of Title 3 of the Penal Code of California, the arresting officer shall prepare in duplicate a written notice to appear in court containing the name and address of such person, the offense charged, and the time and place where and when such person shall appear in court. 
B.  The time specified in the notice shall be at least five but not more than fifteen days after such arrest. 
C.  The place specified in the notice to appear shall be the court of the magistrate before whom the person would be taken if the requirement of taking an arrested person before a magistrate were complied with, or shall be an officer authorized by such court to receive a deposit of bail. 
D.  The officer shall deliver one copy of the notice to appear to the arrested person; and the arrested person, in order to secure release, must give his written promise so to appear in court by signing the duplicate notice which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon, the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody. 
E.  The officer shall as soon as practical file the duplicate notice with the magistrate specified therein. Thereupon, the magistrate shall fix the amount of bail which in his judgment, in accordance with the provision of Section 1275 of the Penal Code of California, will be reasonable and sufficient for the appearance of the defendant, and he shall endorse upon the notice a statement signed by him in the form set forth in Section 815A of the Penal Code of California. The defendant may, prior to the date upon which he promised to appear in court, deposit with the magistrate the amount of bail thus set. Thereafter, at the time when the case is called for arraignment before the magistrate, if the defendant shall not appear either in person or by counsel the magistrate may declare the bail forfeited and may in his discretion order that no further proceedings shall be had in such case. Upon the making of such order that no further proceedings be had, all sums deposited as bail shall forthwith be paid into the county treasury to be distributed as provided in Section 1463 of the Penal Code of the state of California. 
(Ord. 20 §§ l5, 1963)  
1.20.020 - Nonissuance of warrant. 
No warrant shall issue on such charge for the arrest of a person who has given such written promise to appear in court unless and until he has violated such promise or has failed to deposit bail, to appear for arraignment, trial or judgment, or to comply with the terms and provisions of the judgment, as required by law. 
(Ord. 20 § 6, 1963)  
1.20.030 - Promise to appearViolationWarrant issuance. 
A.  When a person signs a written promise to appear at the time and place specified in such written promise and has not posted bail as provided in Section 1.20.010 E, the magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for his arrest within twenty days after his failure to appear as promised, or, if such person promises to appear before an officer authorized to accept bail other than a magistrate and fails to do so on or before the date which he had promised to appear, then within twenty days after the delivery of such written promise to appear by the officer to a magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense. 
B.  When such person violates his promise to appear before an officer authorized to receive bail other than a magistrate, the officer shall immediately deliver to the magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense charged the written promise to appear and the complaint, if any, filed by the arresting officer. 
C.  It is provided that any person willfully violating his written promise to appear in court is guilty of a misdemeanor regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he was originally arrested, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(Ord. 20 § 7, 1963)  
Chapter 1.24 - NUISANCE ABATEMENT[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 852, § 2.A., Exhibit 1, adopted Dec. 11, 2012, deleted Chapter 1.24, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to this amendment, Chapter 1.24 pertained to similar subject matter. See Ordinance List and Disposition Table for derivation. 
 
1.24.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter is twofold. First the purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety, economic, aesthetic and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to protect neighborhoods against property-related nuisances, blight and deterioration by establishing requirements for all buildings, whether residential or non-residential, or structures of whatever kind, and establishing requirements for the maintenance of all land, whether improved or vacant. The city of Rohnert Park has a history and reputation for well-kept properties. Property values and the general welfare of the community are founded, in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of private properties. Owners and occupants of some properties within the city permit conditions to exist which are below the minimum conditions required by this chapter and therefore injurious and detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare of residents of the city and contribute substantially and increasingly to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and commercial areas. Abatement of conditions less than those required by this chapter will promote the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city because maximum use and enjoyment of property in close proximity to other property depends upon maintenance of both properties. This chapter shall apply to all buildings, structures and land within the city without regard to use, date of construction or alterations.

The debt shall be collectible in the same manner as any other civil debt owing to the city and may be made a special assessment or lien upon the property pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter 1.27. 
(Ord. No. 852, § 2.A.(Exh. 1), 12-11-2012)

A.  Notice. The code enforcement officer shall attempt to make contact through a personal interview, or by telephone, with the owner or the person, if any, occupying or otherwise in real or apparent charge and control thereof.

B.  Abatement. In the event the code enforcement officer is unable to make contact as hereinabove noted, or if the appropriate persons, after notification by the code enforcement officer, do not take action as specified by such official, within seventy-two hours, or a lesser period if deemed necessary, then the code enforcement officer may, with the approval of the city manager or his/her designee, take all steps deemed necessary to remove or isolate such dangerous condition, or conditions, with the use of city forces or a contractor retained pursuant to the provisions of this code. The abatement shall include all actions necessary to secure the premises to prevent further occurrence of the nuisance. 
C.  Summary abatement actions shall not be subject to the notice and hearing requirements of this chapter, and an enforcement officer shall not be prohibited from summary abatement actions after initiation of proceedings pursuant to this chapter, if immediate action at any time becomes necessary to preserve or protect the public health or safety. Summary abatement is to be limited to those actions which are reasonably necessary to immediately remove the threat. 
D.  The expense of summarily abating a nuisance shall be a charge against the persons creating, causing, committing or maintaining it. The city may make the expense of abatement of the nuisance a debt collectible in the same manner as any other civil debt owing to the city and may be made a special assessment or lien upon the property pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter 1.27. 
(Ord. No. 852, § 2.A.(Exh. 1), 12-11-2012)

Upon conclusion of such abatement, the enforcement officer shall submit an itemized statement of costs to the city clerk. Costs of abatement shall begin to run from the date of the notice to abate, except in cases of summary abatement, in which case costs of abatement shall begin to run from the date the enforcement officer became aware of the nuisance requiring summary abatement. 
B.  The city may seek reasonable attorney fees incurred for an abatement action and related proceedings in those individual actions or proceedings in which the city elects, at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorney fees. If the city elects to seek recovery of its own attorney fees, attorney fees may be recovered by the prevailing party in said action or proceeding. 
C.  Time spent by city personnel shall, in addition to an employee's hourly rate of pay, include city's customary overhead expenses for provision of benefits and use of office space. Time spent by contract personnel shall be charged at actual cost to the city.

At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the statement of costs and expenses of the abatement, the city council shall hear and pass upon the statement, together with any specific objections or protests raised by any of the persons liable to be assessed for the costs of abating such nuisance. The city council may make such revisions, corrections, or modifications to the statement as it may deem just or necessary. The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
C.  Upon conclusion of the hearing, the city council shall adopt a resolution determining the costs of abatement. The city council may also require, by resolution, that the costs be a nuisance abatement lien or special assessment upon the subject property as provided for in Chapter 1.27 of this code. The decision of the city council shall be final and conclusive.

Editor's note Ord. No. 852, § 2.B., Exhibit 2, adopted Dec. 11, 2012, deleted Chapter 1.25, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to this amendment, Chapter 1.25 pertained to similar subject matter. See Ordinance List and Disposition Table for derivation. 
 
1.25.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to set forth a clear process by which the city may issue administrative citations, in addition to any and all other legal remedies, to address violations of any section of the code. 
(Ord. No. 852, § 2.B.(Exh. 2), 12-11-2012)  
1.25.020 - Applicability. 
A.  The city council has determined that the enforcement of the Rohnert Park Municipal Code throughout the city is an important public service and is vital to the protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. The city council has determined a need for alternative methods of code enforcement and that a comprehensive code enforcement system uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies to gain compliance with code regulations. The city council finds a need to draft precise regulations that can be effectively applied in judicial and administrative proceedings and further finds that there is a need to establish uniform procedures for the proper application of administrative code enforcement remedies and administrative hearings to resolve administrative code enforcement cases and appeals. 
B.  It is the purpose and intent of the city council to afford due process of law to any person who is directly affected by an administrative enforcement action. Due process of law includes adequate notice of the violation and enforcement remedy chosen by the city, an adequate explanation of the reasons justifying the administrative enforcement action taken by the city, and an opportunity to participate in the appropriate administrative enforcement or appeal hearing. These procedures are also intended to establish a forum to efficiently, expeditiously and fairly resolve issues raised by any administrative enforcement action. 
C.  The city manager, or designated representative thereof, is authorized to develop and implement policies and procedures relating to the qualifications, appointment and compensation of administrative hearing officers; the powers of administrative hearing officers, and all other matters relating to conducting administrative hearings as provided in this code. 
D.  The administrative citations provided for in this chapter, are an additional enforcement remedy to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which may be pursued by the city to address any violation of this code or other public nuisance.

B.  Enforcement officers are authorized to enter upon any property or premises within the city to ascertain whether the property or premises is in compliance with the code, and to make any inspection as may be necessary in the performance of their enforcement duties. These inspections may include the taking of photographs, samples or other physical evidence, and the making of video and/or audio recordings. If an owner, lawful occupant, or the respective agent thereof refuses permission to enter and/or inspect, the enforcement officer may seek an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to the procedures provided by California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1822.50 through 1822.59, as may be amended from time to time, or the successor provisions thereto. 
C.  The procedures established in this chapter for the use of administrative citations, and the procedures established in other chapters of this code as means for addressing violations of this code shall be in addition to criminal, civil or other legal or equitable remedies established by law that may be pursued to address violations of this code. The use of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of the city.

1.26.060 - Hearing officer decision.

If the city attorney determines that the violation implicates a First Amendment right, the order shall provide that the order to abate is suspended until the responsible party exhausts his or her judicial remedies. The written determination shall further state that if the nuisance is not abated within the time provided, the nuisance shall be abated by the city at the parties' expense and the expenses may be made a lien or special assessment against the property. 
E.  In the case of an administrative citation issued for a continuing violation pertaining to building, plumbing, electrical, or other similar structural or zoning issues that do not create an immediate danger to health or safety, the administrative hearing officer shall specify a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, to remedy or correct the violation prior to the imposition of fines or penalties. In determining what is a reasonable time the administrative hearing officer may consider the estimate of local professionals including licensed contractors. 
F.  If the administrative hearing officer determines that a nuisance exists which is likely to recur after the abatement, the owner may be directed to take adequate precautions for a period of time not to exceed twelve months so that the nuisance will not recur. 
G.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city. 
(Ord. 53 § 1, 1965)  
3.24.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator or the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credit, and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Tax administrator" means the city clerk or his authorized agent. 
G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to June 16, 1965 may be considered. 
(Ord. 53 § 2, 1965)  
3.24.030 - Tax imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 685 § 1, 2002: 561 § 1, 1992: Ord. 402 § 1, 1982: Ord. 203 § 1, 1973: Ord. 104 § 1, 1968: Ord. 53 § 3, 1965)

3.24.050 - Operator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.

Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 53 § 6, 1965)  
3.24.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of every month or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 53 § 8, 1965)  
3.24.090 - Failure to collect and report taxDetermination of tax by tax administrator. 
If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.24.100. 
(Ord. 53 § 9, 1965)  
3.24.100 - Appeal.

The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 53 § 10, 1965)  
3.24.110 - Records. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable time. 
(Ord. 53 § 11, 1965)  
3.24.120 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant established his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 53 § 12, 1965)  
3.24.130 - Actions to collect. 
A.  Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city.

This credit provision is supplemental to the provisions relating to reimbursement in the city's subdivision ordinance and Government Code Sections 66000 and following. 
B.  Overlap with Other Fees. To the extent that the PF fee includes components for financing projects already included in fees collected under other city ordinances, such other fees, when paid, shall be a credit against the appropriate components of the PF fee. 
C.  Overlap with Bond Financing Districts. To the extent that some or all of the projects proposed to be financed by the PF fee are financed through a community facilities district, special assessment district or other financing mechanism, participation in such other financing mechanism shall be a credit against the appropriate component of the PF fee.

B.  Exemptions. A developer of any project subject to the PF fee may apply to the city for a reduction or adjustment to that fee, or a waiver of that fee, based upon: 
1.  The absence of a reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of that development and either the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed; or 
2.  A lack of proportionality between the impacts of that development and either the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed. 
The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk not later than ten days prior to the public hearing on the development permit application for the project. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver, reduction or adjustment. The city council shall consider the application at the public hearing on the permit application or at a separate hearing held within sixty days after the filing of the fee adjustment application, whichever is later. The decision of the city council shall be final. If a reduction, adjustment or waiver is granted, any change in use within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee. 
If the city council grants an exemption to an impact producing development resulting in a waiver in whole or in part of PF fees otherwise due, the amount of the PF fee waived shall be provided by the city from other funds which shall be deposited in the public facilities fund.

A.  Affordable Housing Linkage Fee. Developers of nonresidential projects must pay the affordable housing linkage fee for nonresidential development in the amount set forth by city council resolution. 
B.  Alternatives to Payment of Affordable Housing Linkage Fee. 
1.  Dedication of Land. As an alternative to the payment of the affordable housing linkage fee, a developer of a nonresidential project may submit a request to mitigate the impacts of his or her proposed development by dedicating land. The city council may approve such a request if it determines that the proposed dedication will further affordable housing opportunities in the city to an equal or greater extent than the payment of the affordable housing linkage fee or construction of affordable units. 
2.  Construction of Units. As an alternative to the payment of the affordable housing linkage fee, a developer of a nonresidential project may submit a request to mitigate the impacts of his or her proposed development by constructing units affordable to very-low and low-income persons. The city council may approve such a request if it determines that the proposed dedication will further affordable housing opportunities in the city to an equal or greater extent than the payment of the affordable housing linkage fee or dedication of land. 
C.  Time of Payment. The requirements of this chapter must be satisfied before building permit issuance or, where a building permit is not required, the issuance of a use permit for the new, expanded, remodeled, or changed nonresidential development. 
D.  Annual Review. The city council will annually review the affordable housing linkage fee requirement to determine whether it is reasonably related to the impacts of development and whether the described affordable housing units are still needed. 
(Ord. 771 § 2 (part), 2006)  
3.36.040 - Application. 
A.  Determination of Development Projects. The affordable housing linkage fee requirement will be applied to nonresidential development projects involving the construction of a new building, construction of additional gross square footage to existing buildings, and interior remodels that increase the employment density, and changes in use that do not require interior remodels but that increase the employee density of the nonresidential development as determined by the director of community development. 
B.  Determination of Land Uses. Nonresidential land uses will be divided into three classifications: commercial, retail, and industrial. The director of community development determines the land use classifications that best describe the nonresidential development, or portion thereof in the case of "mixed use" developments, for the purposes of assigning the fee to be charged. The director of community development shall use the applicable table set forth in the city council resolution establishing the specific affordable unit or housing linkage fee requirements to determine the appropriate classification. 
C.  Change of Land Use. When the director of community development determines that a change of use has been requested to convert existing space from: (1) commercial to industrial or retail, or (2) industrial to retail, a fee equal to the difference in the per square foot fee must be paid prior to the issuance of a use permit. A change of use from residential to nonresidential is subject to the same fee calculation as new construction. 
(Ord. 771 § 2 (part), 2006)  
3.36.050 - Fee adjustment. 
A.  Adjustment. A developer of any project subject to the affordable housing linkage fee may apply to the director of community development for a reduction in, an adjustment to the requirement, or a waiver of the fee, if he or she can demonstrate the absence of any reasonable relationship between the impacts of that development and the fee charged. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the community development director no later than the time of application for a building permit authorizing construction of the project that is subject to the fee or, where a building permit is not required, a use permit. The application shall state completely and in detail both the applicant's factual basis and legal theory for adjustment or waiver and compare its proposal with the analysis set forth in the nexus study. The director of community development shall consider the application and render a decision in writing within thirty days. The decision of the director of community development is appealable as set forth below. 
B.  Appeal Procedure. A decision of the director of community development on an application for a fee reduction, adjustment or waiver may be appealed to the city manager. Any person wishing to appeal a decision of the director of community development shall file an appeal with the city clerk not later than ten days from the date of issuance of the written decision of the director of community development. The written appeal shall state completely and in detail the factual and legal grounds for the appeal. The city manager shall consider the appeal at a public hearing within sixty days after the filing of the appeal. The decision of the city manager is final. 
C.  Cost for Reduction, Adjustment, or Waiver Request or Appeal. The cost of the request for a fee adjustment and appeal shall be borne by the applicant. 
D.  Refund of Fee. If the affordable housing linkage fee is paid and the building permit is later canceled or voided, or if a use permit which triggers the application of the fee fails to vest within the terms of the use permit, the director of community development may, upon written request of the developer, order return of the fee and interest earned on it less administrative costs if: (1) the fees paid have not been committed, and (2) work on the private development project has not progressed to a point that would permit commencement of a new, changed, or expanded use for which an affordable housing linkage fee would be payable. 
(Ord. 771 § 2 (part), 2006)  
3.36.060 - Use of affordable housing linkage fees. 
A.  Use and Disbursement of Monies in the Fund. Monies in the affordable housing linkage fund shall be used in accordance with and in support of activities to implement the city's adopted housing element. Activities shall be limited to direct expenditure for capital projects or incidental noncapital expenditures, related to capital projects, including, but not limited to, land acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, subsidization, counseling or assistance to other governmental entities, private organizations or individuals to expand affordable housing opportunities to low- and moderate-income households. Monies in the affordable housing linkage fund may be disbursed, hypothecated, collateralized, or otherwise employed for these purposes from time to time as the director of community development determines is appropriate to accomplish the purposes of the affordable housing fund. These uses include, but are not limited to, assistance to housing development corporations, equity participation loans, grants, predevelopment loan funds, participation leases, loans to develop affordable housing or other public/private partnership arrangements. The affordable housing funds may be expended for the benefit of both rental or owner-occupied housing. 
B.  Accounting of Fees. All affordable housing linkage fees shall be deposited into a segregated account and all expenditures of these funds shall be documented and included in an annual report which shall be available for public inspection.

The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show its method of business and such information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or, if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon any measure which will reasonably assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter and Chapters 5.08 and 5.12.

A.  Grant. In the event that grantor shall grant to a grantee a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct, a cable communications system within the franchise area, or a renewal of an existing franchise, said franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable communications system as required by the provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement shall include those provisions of the grantee's "Application for Franchise" or "Franchise Proposal" that are finally negotiated and accepted by the grantor and grantee. 
Any franchise granted under the terms and conditions contained herein shall be consistent with federal laws and regulations and state general laws and regulations. In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of the franchise and the terms and conditions on which the grantor can grant a franchise, the general law and/or statutory requirements shall, without exception, control. 
Any franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect or hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the other codes and ordinances of the grantor regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction. 
B.  Franchise required. No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets in the franchise area or be allowed to operate without a franchise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Establishment of franchise requirements. The grantor may establish appropriate requirements for new franchises or franchise renewals, and may modify these requirements from time to time to reflect changing conditions and state of art in the cable industry. Such requirements shall not be retroactive to franchises then in effect, except as set forth in paragraph L, but shall become applicable when the franchise is renewed. 
D.  Authority to grant franchise. The grantor may grant a franchise for all or any defined portion of the city. The service area shall be the entire area defined in the franchise agreement. The initial service area shall be that portion of the franchise area scheduled to receive initial service, as stated in the franchise agreement. 
E.  Use of public streets and ways. For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications system in the franchise area, and subject to the provisions of Section 5.24.070 J. herein, the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across, and along the public streets and ways within the franchise area such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments, towers, antennas and other property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the cable communications system. Prior to construction or alteration, however, the grantee shall in each case file plans with the appropriate grantor agencies and local utility companies, and receive written approval before proceeding. Grantee shall in any event comply with all applicable grantor construction codes and procedures. 
F.  Duration. The term of any new franchise and all rights, privileges, obligations and restrictions pertaining thereto shall be as established in the franchise agreement, unless terminated sooner as hereinafter provided. 
G.  Franchise nonexclusive. Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate, provided however, that such additional grants shall not operate to the material, detriment or to materially modify any rights previously granted to any grantee. 
H.  Franchise applications. Applicants for a franchise shall submit to the grantor written applications utilizing the standardized format provided by the grantor, at the time and place designated by the grantor for accepting applications, and including the application fees designated by grantor. 
I.  Grant procedure. All franchise applications when filed shall be available for public inspection at places designated by the grantor. No later than ninety days after the final date for filing applications, one or more public hearings shall be held on the applications. A decision shall be made by the grantor not later than ninety days after the conclusion of all such public hearings based upon an evaluation of the application(s), the hearings, and other information that the grantor may deem relevant. Grantor may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
J.  Transfer of ownership or control. 
1.  Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public. Said franchise cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or other means without the prior written consent of the grantor, and then only under such reasonable conditions as the grantor may establish. Such consent as required by the grantor shall be given or denied no later than one hundred twenty days following any request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
2.  Hypothecation. Notwithstanding paragraph J.1., the issue and outstanding shares of stock of the grantee may be hypothecated and the system assets may be hypothecated, without the prior approval of the grantor, where such shares and assets are hypothecated in connection with securing an indebtedness of the company which includes, but may not be limited to, indebtedness for this system. 
In the instance of a hypothecation of the shares or assets of the grantee, the sale or transfer of the stock or assets by the lenders shall be subject to the prior approval by the grantor expressed by ordinance. 
3.  Ownership or control. The grantee shall promptly notify in writing the grantor of any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other part of, control of the grantee or its parent. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer by any person or group of persons of twenty-five percent or more of the beneficial ownership interest of the grantee or its parent. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the grantor shall have consented in writing thereto, which consent shall be given or denied no later than one hundred twenty days following any request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry. 
In seeking the grantor's consent to any change in ownership or control, the grantee shall have the responsibility: 
(a)  To show to the satisfaction of the grantor whether the proposed purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the "proposed transferee"), which in the case of a corporation, shall include all directors and all persons having a legal or equitable interest in five percent or more of its voting stock: 
(1)  Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral turpitude including, but not limited to any violation of federal, state or local law or regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation or complaint charging such acts; 
(2)  Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of competent jurisdiction; or 
(3)  Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system. 
(b)  To establish, to the satisfaction of the grantor, the financial solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting all current financial data for the proposed transferee which the grantee was required to submit in its franchise application, and such other data as the grantor may request. Financial statements shall be audited, certified and qualified by a Certified Public Accountant. 
(c)  To establish to the satisfaction of the grantor that the financial and technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms. 
The grantor agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to the grantor shall take control and operate the cable communications system, in the event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to transfer the franchise to another grantee. If the grantor finds that such transfer after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of the applicant are satisfactory, the grantor shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall be given or denied no less than ninety days after any request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
4.  The consent or approval of the grantor to any transfer by the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the grantor in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise. 
5.  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the grantor shall not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of initial construction of the cable system. 
6.  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
K.  Franchise renewal. Franchise renewal shall be as prescribed by applicable law. 
L.  Police powers. In accepting a franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police powers of the grantor to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the grantor pursuant to such power. 
Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other present or future lawful exercise of the grantor's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to any cable communications system franchise which contains provisions inconsistent with this chapter shall prevail only if upon such exercise the grantor finds any emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law. 
M.  Franchise fee. 
1.  Annual franchise payment. A grantee of a franchise hereunder shall pay to the grantor an annual fee in an amount as designated in the franchise agreement. Such payment shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise or any renewal date. The grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a statement within sixty days of the close of the calendar year, audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant, reflecting the total amounts of gross receipts and all payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment. Upon ten days prior written notice, grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of grantee's records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures, and if such audit indicates an underpayment of two percent or more of the franchise fee due, the grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit. 
2.  Acceptance by grantor. No acceptance of any payment by the grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
3.  Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation: 
(a)  An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the average rate of return on invested funds of the city during the period for which payment was due. 
(b)  If the payment is late by thirty days or more, a sum of money equal to five percent of the amount due in order to defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by the grantor by reason of delinquent payment. 
4.  Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement. 
5.  Any grantee "pass through" or itemization of franchise fee costs on subscribers' bills shall be in accordance with federal law. 
N.  Forfeiture or revocation. 
1.  Grounds for revocation. If the grantee has been given due notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, the grantor reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default under this chapter and a material breach of the franchise: 
(a)  If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of its material obligations under this chapter or under such documents, agreements and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the grantee, subject to the provisions of Section 5.24.130 D. 
(b)  If the grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect, the liability and indemnification coverages or the security fund or bonds as required herein. 
(c)  If any court of competent jurisdiction, or any federal or state regulatory body by rules, decisions or other action determines that any material provision of the franchise documents, including this chapter, the franchise agreement and grantee's proposal is invalid or unenforceable prior to the commencement of initial system construction.

In the event the stated violation is not reasonably curable within ninety days, the franchise shall not be terminated or revoked, or damages assessed, if the grantee provides within the said ninety days a plan, satisfactory to the grantor, to remedy the violation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period exceeding ninety days following receipt of such written demand by the grantor, the grantor may place its request for termination of the franchise upon a regular council meeting agenda. The grantor shall cause notice to be served upon such grantee, at least twenty days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published at least once, ten days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the franchise area. 
(b)  The grantor shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine, within ninety days, based upon the preponderance of the evidence, whether the grantee has committed a material breach of this chapter or the franchise agreement, and, if so, whether such breach was willful. 
(c)  If the grantor determines that the grantee has willfully committed a material breach, then the grantor may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and security fund and bonds forfeited, or the grantor may, at its option and if the material breach is capable of being cured by the grantee, direct the grantee to take appropriate remedial action within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as the grantor shall determine are reasonable under the circumstances. 
O.  Procedures in the event of termination or expiration.

1.  Any franchise granted shall, at the option of the grantor, cease and terminate sixty days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said sixty days, or unless: 
(a)  Such receivers or trustees shall have, within sixty days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees within said sixty days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise; and, 
(b)  Such receivers or trustees shall, within said sixty days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction on the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise agreement. 
2.  In the case of a foreclosure or other involuntary sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee, or any part thereof, the grantor may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and to the purchaser at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such notice, unless: 
(a)  The grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner in this chapter provided; and, 
(b)  Such successful purchaser shall have covenanted and agreed with the grantor to assume and be bound by all the terns and conditions of the franchise agreement.

3.  Relief. The grantee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or the grantor may rescind its request to interconnect upon petition by the grantee to the grantor, if the grantor finds that the grantee has negotiated in good faith and has failed to obtain an approval from the system or systems of the proposed interconnection; or that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates.

Grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions of this section when a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on the problem. In the case of a subscriber not being home when the technician arrives, response shall be deemed to have taken place if the technician leaves written notification of arrival. 
No charge shall be made to the subscriber for any service call unless the service request can be demonstrated to be repeated and non-cable system in origin, or to involve subscriber negligence.

A repeated and verifiable pattern of noncompliance with the consumer protection standards of Sections 5.24.090A. and 5.24.090B., after grantee receipt of due notice and an opportunity to cure, may be termed a breach of the franchise, subject to any and all remedies as prescribed in Section 5.24.130 herein and applicable law. 
E.  Complaint procedure. 
1.  Complaints to grantee. Grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints in good faith without intervention by the grantor. The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing. At the conclusion of grantee's investigation of a subscriber complaint, but in no event more than ten days after receiving the complaint, grantee shall notify the subscriber in writing of the results of its proposed action or resolution of the complaint, if any. The grantee shall also notify the subscriber of the subscriber's right to file a complaint with the grantor in the event the subscriber is dissatisfied with the grantee's decision.

The subscriber shall make such filing and notification within twenty days of receipt of grantee's decision or, if no grantee decision has been provided, within thirty days after filing the original complaint with grantee. The grantor may extend these time limits for reasonable cause. 
F.  Review of unresolved disputes by the grantor. The grantor shall determine, based upon a review of an unresolved subscriber complaint and the grantee's response, whether further action is warranted. If the grantor decides to initiate further investigation, the grantor may require the grantee and the subscriber to submit a statement of position, or establish a hearing to be conducted by the grantor. The hearing shall be conducted informally, and the parties may offer any evidence pertinent to the dispute. The grantor shall attempt to mediate between the parties. If no common agreement is reached, the grantor may determine an appropriate resolution to the dispute, and issue findings to that effect, setting forth the basis of the findings and resolution. The decision may be appealed to the city council. 
G.  Notices. 
1.  Operating policies. As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the cable system, and at least once annually thereafter, the grantee shall provide each subscriber with written information concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed, and also furnish information concerning the grantor office responsible for administration of the franchise with the name and telephone number of the office. The notice shall also indicate grantee's business hours, legal holidays and procedures for responding to inquiries after normal business hours. 
The grantee shall provide all subscribers and the grantor written notice no less than thirty days prior to any proposed change in these policies. 
2.  Rates and services. The grantee shall provide all subscribers and the grantor with at least sixty days written notice prior to the implementation of any change in rates or a material change in programming services, excluding temporary marketing and sales promotional discounts or offers. 
3.  Copies to grantor. Copies of all notices provided to subscribers shall be filed concurrently with the grantor. 
H.  Quality of service. The overall quality of service provided by grantee to subscribers may be subject to evaluation by grantor in conjunction with the annual review set forth in Section 5.24.050G. In addition, grantor may evaluate the quality of service at any time, based upon the number of subscriber complaints received by the grantee and the grantor, and grantee's response to those complaints. Grantor's evaluation that service quality is inadequate may lead to direction to grantee to cure the inadequacies. Grantee shall commence corrective action within thirty days after receipt of written notice. Failure to do so shall be deemed to be a breach of the franchise and subject to the remedies prescribed in Section 5.24.130. Grantor, after due process, may utilize the performance bond and/or security of Sections 5.24.060B. and 5.24.060C., respectively, to remedy any such franchise breach. 
I.  Tenant Rights. It is grantor's intent that tenants not be discriminated against in the ability to subscribe to cable services. Grantee shall be required to provide service to tenants in individual units of a multiple housing facility with all services offered to other dwelling units within the franchise area, so long as the owner of the facility consents in writing, if requested by grantee, to the following:

4.  To accept reasonable compensation from the grantee, not in excess of any amount which may be mandated by statute; and 
5.  To not discriminate in rental charges, or otherwise, between tenants who receive cable service and those who do not. 
J.  Grantee rules and regulations. The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure an uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers. Provided, however, that such rules, regulations terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
K.  Rights of individuals. 
1.  Grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, PEG access channel users, or general citizens on the basis of income, race, color, religion, national origin, age or sex. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the grantee from establishing reasonable policies regarding credit risks, subscriber deposits, or advance payment policies, or from refusing to provide service to any household which has a history of non-payment, damage to grantee's equipment, or has threatened or assaulted grantee's employees. Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are hereby incorporated and made part of this chapter by reference. 
2.  Grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity requirements of federal, state and local law and regulations in effect on the date of the franchise grant, and as amended from time to time. 
3.  The grantee's policy with regard to personally identifiable information shall be consistent with federal law. 
4.  Fairness of accessibility. The entire system of the grantee shall be operated in a manner consistent with the principle of fairness and equal accessibility of its facilities, equipment, channels, studios and other services to all citizens, businesses, public agencies and other entities having a legitimate use for the system, and no one shall be arbitrarily excluded from its use. 
L.  Continuity of service mandatory. 
1.  It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In the event that the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the grantor give notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service. 
In the event of a change of grantee, or the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with the grantor, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its services when it no longer operates the system. 
2.  In the event grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of the grantor or without just cause, the grantor may, at its option, and without further process impose liquidated damages not to exceed five hundred dollars per day for each succeeding day that service remains unavailable. 
M.  Identification of employees. Every employee of the grantee or its contractors or subcontractors shall be clearly identified on sight to the public as a representative of the grantee. Every vehicle of the grantee or its contractors or subcontractors shall be similarly identified. The grantee's telephone number shall also be clearly marked on all such vehicles.

5.24.100 - Operation and maintenance. 
A.  Open books and records. The grantee shall manage all of its operations in accordance with a policy of totally open books and records. The grantor, upon reasonable notice, at reasonable intervals and for reasons related to the enforcement and administrative of this chapter or the franchise, and to obtain information which has not otherwise been provided the grantor or which grantor has reasonable basis to believe has not been reported fairly and accurately, shall have the right to inspect at any time during normal business hours, all books, records, maps, plans, service complaint logs, performance test results and other like materials of the grantee which relate to the operation of the franchise and are maintained at the local office required by Section 5.24.090A., provided that the grantor shall maintain the confidentiality of any trade secrets or other proprietary information in the possession of the grantee and provided further, that records shall be exempt from inspection pursuant to this section to the extent required by applicable law regarding subscriber privacy and to the extent such records are protected by law regarding subscriber privacy and to the extent such records are protected by law against discovery in civil litigation. 
If any of such books or records are not kept in the local office, or upon reasonable request made available to the grantor, and if the grantor shall determine that an examination of such records is necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of grantor's duties, then all travel and maintenance expense necessarily incurred in making such examination shall be paid by grantee. 
B.  Records required. 
1.  In any event the grantee shall at all times maintain: 
(a)  The complaint file required by Section 5.24.140E. herein.

(Ord. 486 § 10, 1987)  
5.24.110 - Rights reserved to the grantor.

5.24.130 - Franchise violations. 
A.  Remedies for franchise violations. If the grantee fails to perform any material obligation under the franchise, or fails to do so in a timely manner, the grantor may at its option, and in its sole discretion: 
1.  Assess against the grantee monetary damages up to the limits established in the franchise agreement for material franchise violations, said assessment to be levied against the security fund, hereinabove provided, and collected by grantor after completion of the procedures specified in Section 5.24.130B. The amount of such assessment shall be deemed to represent liquidation of damages actually sustained by grantor by reason of grantee's failure to perform. Such assessment shall not constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or under applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including actual attorney fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the franchise. This provision for assessment of damages is intended by the parties to be separate and apart from grantor's right to enforce the provisions of the construction and performance bonds provided for in Section 5.24.060, and is intended to provide compensation to grantor for actual damages. 
2.  Terminate the franchise, for any of the causes stated in Section 5.24.040, above. 
3.  Impose any lesser penalty consistent with this chapter, the franchise and applicable law, as the grantor may deem appropriate. 
4.  No remedy shall be imposed by grantor against grantee for any violation of the franchise without grantee being afforded due process of law, as provided for in Section 5.24.13GB. below. 
Grantor may impose any or all of the above enumerated measures against grantee, which shall be in addition to any and all other legal or equitable remedies it has under the franchise or under any applicable law. 
B.  Procedure for remedying franchise violations. In the event that the grantor determines that the grantee has violated any material provision of the franchise, the grantor may make a written demand on the grantee that it remedy such violation. If the violation is not remedied, or in the process of being remedied, to the satisfaction of the grantor within thirty days following such demand, the grantor shall determine whether or not such violation by the grantee was excusable or inexcusable, in accordance with the following procedure: 
1.  An administrative hearing shall be held to review the alleged violation. If this hearing does not result in a satisfactory resolution, and/or the grantee requests a public hearing, then a public hearing shall be held, and the grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon thirty days written notice to the grantee of the time and the place of the hearing provided and the allegations of franchise violations. 
2.  If, after notice is given and, at the grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation by the grantee was excusable as provided in Section 5.24.130C. below, the grantor shall direct the grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional time, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the grantor may reasonably direct. 
3.  If, after notice is given and, at the grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation was inexcusable, then the grantor may impose a remedy in accordance with Section 5.24.130A. above. 
C.  Force majeure; grantee's inability to perform. In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of the franchise is prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided grantee has notified grantor in writing within thirty days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event. Such causes beyond grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, Acts of God and civil emergencies. 
Grantor and grantee, in the franchise agreement, may mutually define those conditions deemed subject to force majeure application.

The surveys required to make said report shall be in a form that can be transmitted to subscribers with one or more bills for service, such as postage-paid self-addressed post cards. At the grantor's option, the grantor may prepare the survey form and request its inclusion with a monthly bill to subscribers.

H.  Public inspection. All reports subject to public disclosure, shall be available for public inspection at a designated grantor office during normal business hours. 
I.  Failure to report. The willful refusal, failure, or neglect of the grantee to file any material reports reasonably required, or such other reports as the grantor reasonably may request, may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, and may subject the grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to the grantor under the franchise or otherwise. 
J.  False statements. Any materially false or misleading statement or representation made knowingly and willfully by the grantee in any report required under the franchise may be deemed a material breach of the franchise and may subject the grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to the grantor under the franchise or otherwise. 
K.  Cost of Reports. One copy of all reports and records required under this or any other section shall be furnished at the sole expense of the grantee.

A.  Compliance with state and federal laws. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the state and federal government or any administrative agencies thereof. Provided, however, if any such state or federal law or regulation shall require the grantee to perform any service, or shall permit the grantee to perform any service, or shall prohibit the grantee from performing any service, in conflict with the terms of the franchise or any law or regulation of the grantor, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the grantor of the point of conflict believed to exist between such regulation or law and the laws or regulations of the grantor or the franchise.

In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof or thereof which has been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rules and regulations then in effect, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect, and shall thereafter be binding on the parties hereto, provided that the grantor shall give the grantee thirty days written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision. 
C.  SeverabilityMaterial provisions. If any material section of this chapter, as determined by the grantor and the grantee, is held to be invalid or preempted by federal, state or county regulations or laws, resulting in a material adverse consequence to either party, the grantor and grantee shall attempt to negotiate appropriate modifications to the franchise to provide reasonable relief to the grantor or grantee from such invalidity or preemption, including the payment of damages. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on such modifications, then the dispute shall be submitted to a mutually agreeable arbitrator, in accordance with state law, who shall determine what modifications and/or liquidated damages are appropriate.

G.  Nonenforcement by the grantor. The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of the grantor to enforce prompt compliance.

The following definitions shall apply to this chapter: 
A.  "Shopping cart" means a basket which is mounted on wheels or a similar device generally used in retail establishments by a customer for the purpose of transporting goods of any kind. 
B.  "Public property" means and includes, but is not limited to, all areas dedicated to public use for public street purposes, roadways, alleys, sidewalks, flood control channels and any public right-of-way. 
C.  "Parkway" means that area between the sidewalk and the curb of any street where there is no sidewalk and/or that area between the edge of the roadway and the property line adjacent thereto. Parkway shall also include any area within a roadway which is not open to vehicular travel.

(Ord. 625 § 2, 1996: Ord. 595 § 3, 1995)  
5.30.020 - Abandoned cart. 
When a shopping cart is left standing on any public or private property, the shopping cart shall be deemed to be abandoned and therefore a public nuisance pursuant to this chapter. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to shopping carts left standing on private property (including the common areas of shopping centers adjacent thereto) of the owner of the shopping cart according to the name of the owner affixed thereto as required by Section 5.30.070 of this chapter. In the event that a shopping cart is left standing on any public or private property or, in the event the cart violates Section 5.30.070 of this chapter, the owner thereof shall be responsible and liable for the removal and disposition of the abandoned shopping cart as provided in this chapter. 
The owner of the shopping cart will be noticed to pick up each abandoned cart. The notice will state the location of the cart. If the shopping cart is not retrieved within three business days from the date the owner of the shopping cart, or his or her agent, receives actual notice from the city, then the city may retrieve the cart and charge an applicable fee. A cart may be removed immediately by the city if abandoned in a location which impedes emergency services. The owner may reclaim the cart during regular business hours of the city after payment of the applicable fee. 
The city manager may exempt a shopping cart owner from the provisions of this section if the cart owner has implemented a plan whereby shopping cart employees effectively and actually retrieve the carts or whereby the cart owner has entered into a contract with a cart retrieval service and has provided the city with proof of such contract, provided the frequency of cart retrieval service meets the city manager's approval. 
No liability or responsibility shall accrue to the owner of a shopping cart for the first three occurrences of shopping cart retrieval in a six-month period per calendar year pursuant to this ordinance. This provision shall apply equally to exempt and nonexempt shopping cart owners. 
(Ord. 625 § 3, 1996: Ord. 595 § 4, 1995)  
5.30.030 - Administration and enforcement. 
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall be administered and enforced by the city manager or his authorized representative. In the enforcement of this chapter, the city manager or his authorized representative may enter onto public or private property to examine a shopping cart or parts thereof, or to obtain information as to the identity of a shopping cart and to remove, or cause the removal of, a shopping cart, or parts thereof, declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. 595 § 5, 1995)  
5.30.040 - Shopping cart abatement. 
Upon discovering the existence of a wrecked, dismantled or abandoned shopping cart, or parts thereof, on public or private property within the city, the city manager, or his authorized representative shall have the authority to cause the abatement and removal thereof in accordance with the procedure described in this chapter. 
(Ord. 595 § 6, 1995)  
5.30.050 - Removal of wrecked shopping cart. 
The city manager, or his authorized designee, may determine that a wrecked shopping cart abated according to the provisions of this chapter is in such poor condition that it may be disposed of immediately. This action will be a discretionary decision of the city manager or his authorized designee. 
(Ord. 595 § 7, 1995)  
5.30.060 - Assessments for shopping cart removalHearings. 
A.  Within thirty days of the abatement and removal of any shopping cart located on public or private property within the city, the city manager or his authorized representative shall give notice to the owner thereof (if the same can be ascertained) by mailing a notice of abatement to the last known address of the owner. Such notice shall state the date the shopping cart was removed from public or private property, the location and procedure for retrieval of the shopping cart, and a statement that in order to receive a hearing with regard to the removal of the shopping cart, the owner or its agent shall submit a request for such hearing either in person or in writing within ten days of the date appearing on the notice. Any such shopping cart removed and stored pursuant to these provisions shall be released to the owner thereof if claimed within thirty days after such removal and upon the payment of reasonable administrative fees. Such administrative fees may be waived if, after a hearing has been requested, a determination is made at such hearing that good cause exists for the waiver of such fees. 
B.  Administrative fees for the removal and storage of shopping carts shall be established or modified by resolution of the city council and shall include the actual cost of removal and storage of any shopping cart, or parts thereof, plus the proportional share of the administrative costs in connection therewith. 
C.  Any hearing which is requested shall be conducted within ten business days of the receipt of the request for such hearing, excluding weekends and holidays, by the city manager, or his/her designee, who shall be designated as the hearing officer. The failure of either the owner or its agent to request a hearing shall constitute a waiver and a voluntary relinquishment and abandonment of the hearing requirement. If it is determined at the hearing that reasonable grounds for the abatement and removal of a shopping cart are not established, no fee for removal and storage of such shopping cart shall be imposed. At the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine whether good cause was shown for the abatement or removal of the shopping cart from public or private property. The decision of the hearing officer shall be deemed the final administrative determination. If good cause is shown for the abatement and removal of the shopping cart, the owner or its agent shall have fifteen days from the date of the hearing to retrieve its shopping cart upon payment of the administrative fee. No shopping carts shall be released until the authorized administrative fee is paid to the city. If good cause is not shown for the abatement and removal of the shopping cart from public or private property, the administrative fee shall be waived and the owner or its agent shall have fifteen days to retrieve its shopping cart from the storage area. 
D.  Any shopping carts which are not retrieved by the owner of such shopping cart within thirty days after the mailing of written notice of abatement when such owner has not requested a hearing in accordance with this section, or within thirty days of the decision of the hearing officer, or within ninety days of storage of the cart by the city in all other cases, shall be deemed to be permanently abandoned and may be sold at public auction or otherwise disposed of at the end of thirty day period following mailing written notice of abatement. 
E.  At such time as shall be convenient to the city, the city shall advertise for the sale of permanently abandoned (as provided in subsection D. of this section) shopping carts. Notice of such sale shall be posted in three conspicuous places located within the city. Ten days after the posting of such notice and the time and place fixed in the notice for said sale (or at such time and places to which the sale shall be reasonably continued) such shopping cart may be sold along with other shopping carts, and delivered to the highest bidder free and clear of the claims for the owner thereof. 
F.  The proceeds of such sale shall be disbursed to the city. 
(Ord. 595 § 8, 1995)  
5.30.070 - Identification of shopping carts. 
All shopping carts used in the city shall be properly identified by the owner thereof, including the name of the local store in which such shopping cart is to be used. All persons owning shopping carts within the city for use by their customers to take outside of the buildings shall have firmly affixed thereto the owner's identification. 
(Ord. 595 § 9, 1995)  
5.30.080 - Removal from premises prohibitedExceptions. 
No person shall remove from the immediate store or parking premises of any food store, market or other mercantile establishment in the city, any shopping cart, wagon or similar device, bearing a notification affixed thereto in a conspicuous place thereon to the effect that such cart, wagon or device is not to be removed from the owner's premises, unless such person is the owner or owner's employee or agent. 
(Ord. 595 § 10, 1995)  
5.30.090 - Abandonment prohibited. 
No persons shall abandon or leave any such cart, wagon or device which has been removed from the owner's premises upon any public street, alley, sidewalk, parkway or other public place, or upon any private property, except that of the owner of the cart, wagon or device not under the control of such person abandoning or leaving such cart, wagon or device. 
(Ord. 595 § 11, 1995)  
5.30.100 - Owner's responsibility to prevent littering. 
The action of an owner or owner's agent or employee to permit any such cart, wagon or device to be removed from the owner's premises shall be considered littering. 
(Ord. 595 § 12, 1995)  
5.30.110 - Unlawful possession. 
No person shall have in his/her possession any such cart, wagon or device which has been removed from the owner's premises without authorization or which has been abandoned or left on private property under circumstances as described in Section 5.30.020 of this chapter unless such person so having possession has notified Rohnert Park police department of the presence and location of such cart, wagon or device. 
(Ord. 595 § 13, 1995)  
5.30.120 - Supplementation of codes, statutes, ordinances, etc. 
This chapter is not to be construed as the exclusive regulation of wrecked, dismantled or abandoned shopping carts within the city.

5.32.030 - Video services tax. 
A.  There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using video services in the City from a video service supplier. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of four percent (4.0%) of the charges made for such video services to residential customers and six percent (6.0%) of the charges made for commercial customers. For purposes of this section, "commercial customers" shall include all those customers that are not residential customers and that are not a non-profit corporation (as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)). The tax shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier or its billing agent. 
B.  The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the video service suppliers in the city to identify the various components of video service that are being offered to customers within the city, and the charges therefore. The tax administrator may, thereafter, issue and disseminate to such video service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components that are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of video service; or, ii) which currently are, or historically have been, included in a bundled rate for video service by a local distribution company. Charges for such components shall be subject to the tax of subsection (A) above. 
C.  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the video services. If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier can reasonably identify the non-taxable services based upon its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business, which shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
D.  The tax imposed in this section shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier, its billing agent, or a reseller of such services. In the case of video service, the service user shall be deemed to be the purchaser of the bulk video service (e.g., an apartment owner), unless such service is resold to individual users, in which case the service user shall be the ultimate purchaser of the video service. The amount collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax administrator on or before the last day of the following month and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the last day of the following month. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.040 - Telephone Communications Services Tax 
A.  There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using any international, interstate and/or intrastate telephone communications services in the City, other than a telephone corporation. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of four percent (4.0%) of the charges made for such telephone communications services to residential customers and six percent (6.0%) of the charges made for commercial customers. For purposes of this section, "commercial customers" shall include all those customers that are not residential customers and that are not a non-profit corporation (as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)). The tax shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier or its billing agent. To the extent allowed by law, the tax on telephone communications services shall apply to a service user if the billing or service address of the service user is within the City's boundaries, irrespective of whether a particular telephone communication service originates and/or terminates within the City. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used. 
B.  The tax imposed under subsection (A) shall not be imposed upon any person for using telephone communication services to the extent that, pursuant to Sections 4252 and 2453 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amounts paid for such communication services are exempt from or are not subject to tax imposed under Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event that the federal excise tax on "communication services" as provided in Sections 4251, 4252 and 4253 of the Internal Revenue Code is subsequently repealed, any reference in this section to such law, including any related federal regulations, private letter rulings, case law, and other opinions interpreting these sections, shall refer to that body of law that existed immediately prior to the date of repeal, as well as to any judicial or administrative decision interpreting such federal excise tax law, which is published or rendered after the date of the appeal. 
C.  The tax administrator may, from time to time, issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this ordinance, an administrative ruling identifying those telecommunication services that are subject to the tax of subsection (A) above. This administrative ruling shall be consistent with legal nexus and the federal excise tax rules, regulations, and laws pertaining to "communications services," and shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology, or increase an existing tax. 
D.  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the telephone communication services. If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier can reasonably identify charges not subject to the tax based upon its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business, which shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
E.  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall not include: 
1.  Charges for services paid for by inserting coins in coin-operated telephones except that where such coin-operated service is furnished for a guaranteed amount, the amounts paid under such guarantee plus any fixed monthly or other periodic charge shall be included in the base for computing the amount of tax due. 
2.  Charges for any type of service or equipment furnished by a service supplier subject to public utility regulation during any period in which the same or similar services or equipment are also available for sale or lease from persons other than a service supplier subject to public utility regulation. 
F.  To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of telephone communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the tax administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city on such telephone communication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the City under this section. For purposes of establishing, sufficient legal nexus for the imposition and collection of utility users' tax on charges for telephone communication services pursuant to this chapter, "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition and collection of the utility users' tax to the fullest extent permitted by California and federal law, and as it may change from time to time. 
G.  The tax on telephone communication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the tax administrator on or before the last day of the following month; and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the last day of the following month. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.050 - Exemptions for residential customers 
A.  The taxes imposed by this chapter shall not apply to any person sixty-five (65) years of age or over, or to any person whose total personal income, from all sources, for the previous calendar year, does not exceed that level which shall constitute "very low income" as established annually on January 31st by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development defines very low income as 50% of the Sonoma County Median Income with income adjustments made for family size. For the purpose of determining income, the income of the entire household from all sources will be evaluated. Very low income applicants must be able to prove financial independence according the most recent U.S. Internal Revenue Service regulations and standards. Any taxpayer claiming the exemption under this section shall be required to demonstrate their entitlement thereto annually by submitting an application, on a form approved by the Tax Administrator, that shall state those facts and provide the supporting documentation that qualify the applicant for this exemption. Such supporting information may include, but is limited to, federal income tax returns and W-2 forms. The Tax Administrator shall publish a written policy explaining the procedure to apply for an exemption and describing the information that must be submitted by the service user. 
B.  Once annually (July), the city manager, or his or her designee shall receive all applications and certify as exempt those subscribers who are sixty-five years of age or older or whose gross annual income constitutes "very low income" as defined in subparagraph A. Upon completion of the verification process, the city manager, or his or her designee shall process within thirty days refunds to qualified applicants. The refund is limited to taxes paid over a period of the previous six months prior to the refund application. All exemptions given to individuals sixty-five (65) years or older shall continue and be renewed automatically by the city manager or his or her designee. Very low income exemptions will expire each year. The very low income applicant will be required to submit an exemption application on an annual basis to continue their exemption. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefits of the exemption provided by this section when the basis for such exemption either does not exist or ceases. 
C.  If deemed exempt by the tax administrator, such service user shall give the tax administrator timely written notice of any change in service suppliers so that the tax administrator can properly notify the new service supplier of the service user's tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of taxes collected and remitted to the tax administrator from such service user as a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the tax administrator, a service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, shall provide a list of the names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing records, are deemed exempt from the utility users' tax. With respect to a service user of telephone communication services, a service supplier of such telephone communication services doing business in the city shall, upon request of the tax administrator, provide a copy of the federal exemption certificate for each exempt customer within the city that is served by such service supplier. 
D.  The exemptions in Section 5.32.50 do not apply to commercial customers. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.060 - Other refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid, or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in this section. 
B.  The tax administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this chapter, provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor or administrator has submitted a written claim to the tax administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant's right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers. 
C.  The submission of a written claim as set forth in Chapter 2.44 shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. 
D.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of charges for past services, the taxes paid pursuant to the ordinance on the amount of such refunded service charges shall also be refunded to service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly return. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.070 - Interest and penalty. 
A.  Taxes collected from a service user, or owed by a service user subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter are delinquent if not received by the tax administrator on or before the due dates provided in this chapter. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the tax administrator on or before the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the City's account on the following business day. 
B.  1.  Original Delinquency. If the person required to collect and/or remit the tax fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more services or charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit the tax collected, or, in the case of a service user that fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax under Section 5.32.110 of this chapter, the tax administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance. 
2.  Continued Delinquency. Any person who fails to remit any delinquent remittance within a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
3.  The tax administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the tax administrator. 
4.  Each penalty amount imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax amount required to be remitted to the tax administrator. 
C.  Interest. In addition to any other penalties imposed by this chapter, any person required to collect and/or remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter who fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more services or charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit the tax collected, or, in the case of a service user that fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax under this chapter, shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.080 - Actions to collect. 
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the tax administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to collect and remit. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount, along with any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person's noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, plus interest and penalties as herein provided. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.090 - Duty to collect and remit-Procedures. 
The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this chapter shall be performed as follows: 
A.  The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as and along with the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practices of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid except in those cases where a service user pays the full amount of the charges but notifies the service supplier of his refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 5.32.110 of this chapter shall apply. 
B.  The duty of a service supplier to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the service user, which starts on or after the operative date of this chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. 
C.  Each person required by this chapter to collect and remit a tax shall file a return with the tax administrator on forms approved by the tax administrator on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax owed shall be included with the return and filed with the tax administrator. The tax administrator is authorized to require such additional information, as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code § 7284.6, the tax administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information, and not subject to the Public Records Act. If the person subject to this section unreasonable denies the tax administrator, or the tax administrator's designated representative, access to such records, then the tax administrator may impose a penalty of $500 on such person for each day following the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)

B.  The tax administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such rules and regulations shall be on file in the office of the tax administrator. 
C.  Upon a proper showing of good cause, the tax administrator may make administrative agreements to vary the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby: i) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier or service user so long as said agreements result in collections of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or, ii) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the office of the tax administrator, and such agreements are voidable by the tax administrator or the city at any time. 
D.  The tax administrator alone shall be authorized to determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from or a refund of, the tax imposed by this chapter. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.110 - Assessment-Administrative remedy. 
A.  Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a service supplier required to collect the tax, that a service user has failed to pay the amount of the tax for a period of two or more billing periods, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, the tax administrator may relieve said service supplier of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specific billing periods. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The tax administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that he or she has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have changed his or her address, to his or her last known address. If the service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within fifteen (15) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, which shall be the date of mailing if service was not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five (25%) percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, along with interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid, but not less than five dollars ($5.00). 
C.  The tax administrator may make an assessment for taxes not paid or remitted by a person required to pay or remit. A notice of the assessment shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes and penalties imposed and the time and place when such assessment shall be submitted to the city manager for confirmation or modification, who shall appoint a hearing officer. The hearing officer shall mail a copy of such notice to the service supplier and to the service user at least-ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing and shall post such notice for at least five (5) continuous days prior to the date of the hearing. Any interested party having any objections may appear and be heard at the hearing provided his or her objection is filed in writing with the hearing officer prior to the time of the hearing. At the time fixed for considering such assessment, the hearing officer shall hear the same, together with any objections filed as provided in this subsection, and thereupon may confirm or modify such assessment. Upon confirmation or modification of the assessment, the city may seek to recover the amount of the assessment by any lawful means, including but not limited to the bringing of an action against the person responsible for payment of the amount. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.120 - Appeals. 
If a service user or service supplier is aggrieved by any assessment, decision or administrative ruling of the tax administrator, or with the failure to grant a refund or exemption as provided for under this chapter, he or she may appeal to the city manager. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.130 - Temporary Reduction in the Rate of Tax. 
Each of the taxes approved, imposed and levied by this chapter on the operative date of this ordinance may be temporarily reduced and levied at a lesser rate by resolution of the city council. Each such temporary reduction of the tax rate shall be in effect and may be levied at a reduced rate only for the period of time authorized in the city council resolution. At the conclusion of that period of time, the tax shall be levied at the full amount of the rate in effect on the operative date of this chapter. Voter approval shall not be required at the conclusion of the temporary reduction when the tax rate is again levied at the rate provided for on the operative date of this chapter. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.140 - Records. 
A.  It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and/or remittance to the tax administrator, which records the tax administrator or his/her authorized representative shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time. 
B.  The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the tax administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the tax administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the tax administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to conduct the inspection. 
C.  The tax administrator, or the tax administrator's designated representative, is authorized to execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the city attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7. 
D.  If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: i) provide to the tax administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and, ii) upon request of the tax administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the tax administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city. 
E.  If any person subject to record-keeping under this section unreasonably denies the tax administrator, or the tax administrator's designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the tax administrator or the tax administrator's designated representative may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) on such person for each day following: i) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or, ii) the due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this chapter. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.150 - Notice of changes to ordinance. 
If a tax under this chapter is repealed or reduced, or the tax base is changed, the tax administrator shall follow the notice requirements of Public Utilities Code Section 799. Prior to the effective date of the ordinance change, the service supplier shall provide the tax administrator with a copy of any written procedures describing the information that the service supplier needs to implement the ordinance change. If the service supplier fails to provide such written instructions, the tax administrator, or its agent, shall send, by first class mail, a copy of the ordinance change to all collectors and remitters of the city's taxes according to the latest payment records of the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.160 - Construction. 
This chapter shall be construed and interpreted, at all times, in a manner that is consistent with state and federal law. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
5.32.170 - Severability. 
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this chapter or any part thereof. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrases thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional. 
(Ord. 684 § 1, 2002)  
Chapter 5.34 - PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
 
5.34.010 - Findings. 
A.  The public rights-of-way and other public property are a substantial asset managed by the city in trust for its citizens. It is the city's obligation, and has been the historical role of the city, to manage the rights-of-way in a manner which best promotes the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and results in fair compensation for occupancy and use of the rights-of-way. 
B.  The city maintains and strives to keep in good repair the rights-of-way, at substantial and ongoing cost, Although the general taxpayers bear the financial burden of these costs, a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of the rights-of-way is their frequent excavation, construction and reconstruction by telecommunications providers who receive revenue and profit from their use of public property. 
C.  The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Section 256(c)) confirms the authority of local governments "to manage the public rights-of-way" and "to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights-of-way," 
D.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires that actions taken by the city be "competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory." This requirement obligates the city to establish a regulatory structure that treats all rights-of-way occupants and applicants on a nondiscriminatory basis, 
E.  This chapter is intended to conform to the provisions of federal and state law relating to the regulation of providers of public and private utilities, including but not limited to, telecommunications providers (including telephone companies), natural gas providers, and electricity providers. 
F.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service. 
(Ord. 660 § 1 (part), 2000)  
5.34.020 - Intent. 
It is the intent of this chapter to: 
A.  Establish a regulatory and management structure and procedures for the occupancy and use of the public rights-of-way by all telecommunications providers as lawfully allowed by federal and state law; 
B.  Encourage the entry of new telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis; 
C.  Establish nondiscriminatory procedures by which the city receives fair compensation for the occupancy and use of its public rights-of-way; 
D.  Establish nondiscriminatory procedures by which the adverse effects of the use of the rights-of-way by a multiplicity of telecommunications providers, such as congestion, damage, inconvenience to the public and visual blight, can be minimized. 
(Ord. 660 § 1 (part), 2000)

5.34.130 - BondForfeiture. 
A.  Licensee shall, prior to the issuance of any permit for construction in the public rights-of-way, deliver to the city a performance bond in the amount of one hundred percent of the total estimated cost of all work relating to the public right-of-way to be performed under such permit, as determined by the city engineer at the time of application. The bond shall be provided in a form acceptable to the city and maintained in full force and effect until the permitted work in the public rights-of-way is completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer, whereupon the amount of the bond shall be reduced to ten percent of the actual cost of the work and shall be maintained by licensee for a period of one year as a guarantee the work is of good quality and free from any defective or faulty material or workmanship. The surety supplying the bond must be an "admitted surety insurer," as defined in Section 995.120 of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorized to do business in the state of California. Return of the bond shall be conditioned upon licensee's faithful performance of all work in the public rights-of-way specified in the applicable permit.

B.  Neither the provisions of this section nor any damage recovered by the city hereunder shall be construed to excuse licensee's faithful performance of any right-of-way agreement or limit the liability or damages of licensee under this chapter, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 
(Ord. 660 § 1 (part), 2000)  
5.34.140 - Use of facilitiesChanges in use.

(Ord. 660 § 1 (part), 2000)  
5.34.150 - Transfer of agreement or facilities. 
The execution of a right-of-way agreement is a privilege to be held in personal trust by licensee. Subject to applicable law, no right-of-way agreement or any facility permitted thereunder shall be sold, leased, licensed, assigned, disposed of or otherwise transferred ("transfer"), in whole or in part, either by involuntary or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, stock transfer, transfer in trust or otherwise, if such transfer results in a nonrevocable transfer of control, without the prior written notification of the city. A sale or transfer of stock, assets or other equitable interests of licensee, or of any parent, subsidiary or other affiliate or licensee, which effects a material change in licensee's ownership or control, as determined by the city, shall be deemed to be a transfer for purposes of this section. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer by any person or group of persons of fifty percent or more of the beneficial ownership interest of the grantee or its parent. Any proposed transferee must agree to comply with all provisions of the right-of-way agreement and this chapter. 
(Ord. 660 § 1 (part), 2000)

By executing a right-of-way agreement, the city does not agree to restrict the number of right-of-way agreements to be executed that cover all or any part of the city for any person in the same business, a competing business or a related business as the licensee. 
B.  A right-of-way agreement only authorizes licensee to use the public rights-of-way, and the use of any other public property, whether located within or outside a public right-of-way, is strictly prohibited unless authorized by a separate agreement with the city.

If an animal is deemed potentially dangerous by the patrol sergeant in accordance with Section 6.04.010, subsection (E), the animal control officer may immediately impose reasonable conditions upon the owner of the animal to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. If the patrol sergeant does not concur with the animal control officer's determination that the animal should be deemed potentially dangerous, the animal, if previously seized and/or impounded, shall be released to its owner. During the duration of any appeal of the patrol sergeant's determination, the owner of the animal must comply with any or all of the conditions set forth below. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

No. 904 , § 2, adopted March 14, 2017. 
 
8.32.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of individuals residing, working, or visiting in the city of Rohnert Park by limiting exposure of secondhand smoke to nonsmokers, especially children; by protecting the public from smoking and smoking-related litter and pollution; and, by affirming and promoting a healthy environment in the city. 
( Ord. No. 915 , § 2(Exh. A), 1-23-2018)  
8.32.020 - Findings. 
A.  Numerous studies have determined that smoking is a major contributor to indoor air pollution. 
B.  The Surgeon General of the United States has documented that breathing secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard, particularly to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function. 
C.  Breathing secondhand smoke has been determined to be a health hazard by increasing the incidence of lung cancer, bronchitis, and respiratory infection while decreasing exercise tolerance and respiratory function. 
D.  Non-smokers who suffer from allergies, respiratory diseases, or the negative effects of breathing secondhand smoke or aerosol emissions from electronic cigarettes may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions. 
E.  Persons, particularly employees and tenants in multi-unit buildings, have a right to a smoke free environment if they desire. 
F.  Secondhand smoke exposure causes as many as three hundred thousand children in the United States to suffer from lower respiratory tract infections, exacerbates childhood asthma, and increases the risk of acute chronic, middle ear infections. 
G.  As aerosol emissions from electronic cigarettes have been found to contain as least ten chemicals that are on California's list of chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm, including acetaldehyde benzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, isoprene, lead, nickel, nicotine, N-nitrosonornicotine, and toluene, secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol is a health concern. 
H.  People exposed to aerosol emissions from electronic cigarettes absorb nicotine, a substance that can cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm, at levels comparable to secondhand smoke, and are also exposed to volatile organic compounds and other particulate matter that can lead to tissue inflammation. 
I.  It is within the city's authority under its police power to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

No adult business permit may be sold, transferred, or assigned by any owner, or by operation of law, to any other person unless and until the transferee obtains an amendment to the permit from the director stating that the transferee is now the owner. Such an amendment may be obtained only if the transferee files an application with the director in accordance with Section 8.37.040 (including payment of the applicable application fee), and the director determines in accordance with Section 8.37.050 that the transferee would be entitled to the issuance of the original permit. Without such amendment to the permit, any other purported sale, transfer, or assignment or attempted sale, transfer, or assignment will be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of the permit and thereafter the permit will be null and void.

8.38.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the licensing of adult business performers in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the city. The intent of the performer licensing provisions are (1) to protect minors by requiring that all performers be over the age of eighteen years; (2) to assure the correct identification of persons performing in adult businesses; (3) to enable the city to deploy law enforcement resources effectively; and (4) to detect and discourage the involvement of crime in adult businesses by precluding the licensing of performers with certain sex-related convictions within a prescribed time period. 
It is neither the intent nor the effect of these regulations to invade the privacy of performers or to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor the effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to communicative materials or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of adult businesses to their intended lawful market. 
Nothing in these regulations is intended to authorize, legalize, or permit the establishment, operation, or maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the state of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, obscene or harmful matter, or the exhibition or public display thereof. 
( Ord. No. 887 , § 4(Exh. B), 5-26-2015)

This temporary adult business performer license authorizes a performer to commence performance at an adult business that possesses a valid adult business permit authorized to provide adult live entertainment.

Chapter 9.58 - LITTERING 
 
9.58.010 - City council findingsDeemed nuisance when. 
A.  The city council finds and determines that the distribution of unsolicited printed matter upon private property can be a nuisance and that the continued distribution of such unsolicited printed matter after a request by a property owner or occupant constitutes an annoyance and an invasion of privacy. 
B.  The city council further finds and determines that printed matter that is indiscriminately distributed upon private property when it is not requested by the owner, after notice to the distributor to cease and desist such distribution, can be a source of litter and debris in the community. 
C.  The city council further finds and deter-mines that the continued distribution of printed matter upon private property after notice from the owner or occupant of the private property constitutes a public nuisance. 
D.  In order to control the unsolicited distribution of printed matter upon private property after notice from the owner or occupant, the Rohnert Park city council does ordain the provisions set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. 381 § l (part), 1981)  
9.58.020 - Unsolicited littering prohibited. 
No person shall throw, distribute, deposit, place or attach or in any other way leave any handbill, circular, newspaper, paper, booklet, poster or any other printed matter on private property after notice from the owner or occupant of the private property to cease and desist from such activity. 
(Ord. 381 § 1 (part), 1981)  
9.58.030 - Notice by owner or occupant defined. 
In the event the lawful owner or occupant of the private property upon which the printed matter has been deposited does not desire further deposits of the material, the owner or occupant shall give written notice to the distributor of the printed matter. The term distributor means the person or entity who causes and for whose benefit the distribution is made. 
(Ord. 381 § l (part), 1981)  
Chapter 9.60 - PLACEMENT OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS 
 
9.60.010 - City council findings. 
The Rohnert Park city council finds: 
A.  The unsolicited placement of advertising material, political advertising, religious material and any other printed matter upon motor vehicles and other private property without the knowledge and consent of the owner, constitutes a nuisance and is a source of substantial litter and debris within the community. 
B.  A substantial amount of such printed matter is not wanted by the owner of the motor vehicle or of the private property and, when the property owner returns to his or her motor vehicle or property, the printed material is removed from the motor vehicle or private property and cast aside upon either public or private property. The additional debris on public or private property is a source of public and private annoyance, costs, additional funds to supervise and police, is a source of refuse for rodents, insects and other vermin, and is not aesthetically pleasing or compatible with surrounding property, especially in instances where the adjacent property owner is attempting to police his or her property. 
C.  The city is attempting to control costs of public street-sweeping and other costs incidental to the control of waste and debris, and is also attempting to educate and encourage private citizens to participate in waste management. 
D.  The city has no intention or desire to interfere with rights of a citizen to petition the government, or to freely advocate ideas and proposals under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The city council finds that First Amendment rights can be exercised in a manner consistent with this chapter, in that no restriction is placed on the distribution of printed material that is personally handed or personally delivered to the public so that the recipient of the material personally accepts it from the distributor. Under such circumstances, the city council finds that less litter and debris will result in the city, since some members of the public, not interested in the material, will refuse it and other members of the public who accept the material personally, presumably will do so because they desire to read it and will later dispose of it in a proper receptacle. 
(Ord. 384 § l (part), 1981)  
9.60.020 - Placement of printed matter upon motor vehicles or other private property prohibited. 
The placement of printed matter upon motor vehicles or other private property located in public streets, public parks, public or private parking lots, private shopping centers and other public or private sites of public congregation is prohibited. 
(Ord. 384 § l (part), 1981)  
9.60.030 - Distribution of printed matter by personal delivery. 
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the distribution of printed matter by personal delivery or by handing the material directly to the recipient thereof. 
(Ord. 384 § 1 (part), 1981)  
9.60.040 - Solicitation of signatures to petition excepted. 
Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the personal solicitation of signatures to a petition to redress grievances addressed to any governmental agency nor the distribution of any printed material which accompanies the solicitation provided the solicitations are made in person and the printed material that is given is personally handed to the person whose signature or whose support is being solicited.

Chapter 9.65 - ALARM SYSTEMS 
 
9.65.010 - Declaration of policy. 
It is the policy of the city of Rohnert Park to provide a quick and efficient response to all emergency calls for aid from the police or fire services. In the case of burglary, robbery and fire alarms some businesses and restaurants utilize an alarm system that records the request for aid directly to the police department or some central reporting system. 
In some cases the alarms are false alarms and public resources are diverted to the source of the alarm only to find that they have responded to a false alarm. Because the response by the city results in a considerable expenditure of city employee time and is an expense to the city both in manpower and materials, the city council has determined that the expense of such response should be reimbursed if the number of responses exceed a certain amount annually. 
(Ord. 522 § 2, 1990)  
9.65.020 - Definitions. 
"Alarm" means an alarm signal from a residence or business location in the city of Rohnert Park which ends at the city department of public safety offices, or at a central alarm company office which in turn relays it to the department of public safety offices and which causes city personnel to respond, or through whatever means results in the response of department of public safety personnel. 
"Emergency" means an incident which reasonably requires a response by public safety personnel. A response due to a failure, malfunction or other error, whether human or mechanical, which results in the transmission of an alarm to department of public safety offices is not an emergency. In the event that a question of whether a response by city personnel was a response to an emergency the determination of the director of public safety shall be final. 
"False alarm" means an alarm to which city personnel or equipment have responded because of a report that an emergency existed and which did not require a response because the incident for which the alarm was given did not occur. 
(Ord. 522 § 2, 1990)  
9.65.030 - False alarms, a public nuisance. 
Alarm systems which transmit a false alarm to the department of public safety offices of the city of Rohnert Park and which result in the city dispatching public safety personnel and city equipment to a location are a public nuisance. 
(Ord. 522 § 2,1990)  
9.65.040 - False alarms in excess of four per calendar year, abatement of nuisance by fee schedule. 
All responses to the same location within the city of Rohnert Park in excess of four per calendar year shall be discouraged by billing the owner or occupant of the location under the fee schedule as defined in Rohnert Park Municipal Code Section 9.65.080. 
The fees imposed may be assessed against the property to which the response was made in accordance with California Government Code Section 38773.5. 
(Ord. 522 § 2, 1990)

A schedule summarizing the specific charitable expenditures of all bingo proceeds should be attached to the certification to provide detail verification of charitable expenditures shown in the financial statement. The certification should be approved and signed by the appropriate officers and board of directors as true and correct.

Chapter 9.70 - MOBILE HOME ORDINANCE[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ordinance No. 494 contained herein was adopted by Initiative Election held on December 8, 1987. Measure L, passed by the voters on November 8, 1994 amended Section 9.70.132 to allow city council to amend Ordinance No. 494 (Chapter 9.70) after public hearing before the rent appeals board and a four/fifths vote of the city council. Ordinance No. 495 repealed the provisions of Ordinance No. 487 which added Chapter 9.68, entitled Mobile Home Space Rent Adjustment and Registration, to the Code. 
 
9.70.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to alleviate the hardship of unreasonable rent increases while still assuring owners' right to a fair return. 
A.  The city council finds the following conclusions to be true and correct: 
1.  In Rohnert Park, there are five mobile home parks containing one thousand three hundred seventeen spaces, of which one thousand three hundred nine spaces are available for rental to mobile home coach owners (in 1995). 
2.  Mobile homes provide an important form of affordable housing for a substantial number of Rohnert Park residents. 
3.  The majority of mobile home park home-owners/residents are age fifty-five or older. 
4.  The majority of mobile home park homeowners/residents own the mobile homes which they occupy and many of these homeowners/residents typically have substantial loan payments to meet in addition to rent payments. 
5.  The Rohnert Park General Plan recommends that the city maintain and preserve its existing stock of affordable housing of which mobile home park spaces are typically an example. 
6.  Studies undertaken in surrounding areas have shown that typical moving costs for mobile homes from one mobile home park to another (if vacant spaces could be located) range from approximately five thousand dollars to nine thousand dollars, depending upon the size of the mobile home. In many instances, removal requires a separation of the mobile home unit from appurtenances which have been made permanent, thus creating severe damage and depreciation in value to the mobile home. 
7.  Mobile homes and manufactured housing have represented an affordable form of shelter to citizens of Rohnert Park with modest incomes. Because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens, persons on fixed incomes, and persons of low and moderate income, space rent increases can have a significant impact on these families. 
8.  The need for effective and fair mobile home park space rent stabilization continues to exist in Rohnert Park. 
9.  It would be desirable to provide prospective homeowners/residents of mobile home coaches with an option to choose between a long-term lease and a periodic tenancy of less than one year in duration. Such an option furthers a legitimate governmental objective and is not in conflict with or preempted by state law. 
10.  On average, several mobile home coaches are sold or offered for sale each year in Rohnert Park. It would be highly desirable to provide vacancy control in the rent stabilization program as hereunder provided. 
11.  The city further finds that this article is necessary to preserve public health, welfare, and safety. 
12.  There exist substantial differences in space rents within given mobile home parks in Rohnert Park. 
B.  The purpose of this chapter is to stabilize the rate of mobile home park space rental in order to: 
1.  Prevent exploitation of a shortage of vacant mobile home park spaces should it occur; 
2.  Prevent excessive and unreasonable mobile home park space rent increases while still assuring park owners' right to a fair return; 
3.  Provide a process for ensuring mobile home park owners a fair, just and reasonable rate of return on their parks in cases where the guaranteed annual space rent increase provided by this chapter proves insufficient. 
4.  Assist in protecting affordable housing to help provide a variety of housing types within a range of costs affordable to the low and very low income households. 
5.  Rectify the disparity of bargaining power which exists between mobile home park home-owners/residents and/or prospective homeowners/ residents and mobile home park owners.

(Ord. 658 § 2, 2000; Ord. 612 § 3, 1996: Ord. 607, 1995: Ord. 599 § 4, 1994: Ord. 494 § 5, 1987)  
9.70.055 - Limits to annual general adjustment formula. 
In the event the vacancy control provision in section 9.70.042, or the prospective homeowner rights in section 9.70.044 is (are) invalidated in any way or by any authority, then the following section shall be enforced: section 9.70.050.

(Ord. 612 § 3, 1996)  
9.70.060 - Individual adjustment of ceiling on allowable rents. 
Any landlord or homeowner/resident can appeal for an individual adjustment of the maximum allowable rent. 
A.  Substantive grounds for rent adjustment applied for by landlords. A rent adjustment shall be approved in order to provide a just and reasonable return and maintain net operating income in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  Fair net operating income. Fair return applications shall be considered according to the following guidelines: 
a.  Net operating income equals gross income minus operating expenses. 
b.  Gross income equals the following: 
(i)  Gross rents, computed as gross rental income at one hundred percent occupancy; plus 
(ii)  Interest from security and cleaning deposits (except to the extent that said interest is payable to the homeowners/residents); plus 
(iii)  Income from services, garage and parking fees; plus 
(iv)  All other income or consideration received or receivable for or in connection with the use or occupancy of rental spaces and housing services; minus 
(v)  Uncollected rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent the same are beyond the landlord's control. Uncollected rents in excess of three percent of gross rents shall be presumed to be unreasonable unless established otherwise. 
c.  Operating expenses-inclusions: Operating expenses shall include the following: license fees, real property taxes, utility costs, insurance, maintenance, management expenses (contracted or owner performed), including necessary and reasonable advertising, accounting, other managerial expenses, normal repair and maintenance expenses, allowable legal expenses, and the amortized cost of capital improvements. Management expenses are presumed to be six percent of gross income, unless established otherwise. 
Owner-performed labor shall be counted at reasonable rates as established by board regulation. 
Building improvements, major repairs, replacement and maintenance subject to the condition that said expenses shall be amortized in accordance with board regulations, except to the extent such costs are compensated by insurance proceeds. 
d.  Excluded from operating expenses. Operating expenses shall not include: avoidable and unnecessary expense increases since the base year, mortgage interest and principal payments, fees, penalties and interest awarded for violation of this or any other law, or legal fees except as provided in this subsection and depreciation of the property. 
Allowable legal expenses shall include attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with successful good faith attempts to recover rents owing and successful good faith unlawful detainer actions not in violation of applicable law, to the extent the same are not recovered from homeowners/residents. Attorney's fees and costs incurred in proceedings before the board, or in connection with civil actions against the board, are not allowed as operating expenses. 
e.  Base year for the purpose of this section shall be 1985. 
f.  Presumption of fair base year net operating income. Except as provided in subparagraph g., it shall be presumed that the net operating income produced by the property during the base year provided a fair return (fair net operating income). Landlords shall be entitled to earn a just and reasonable return and to maintain and increase their base year net operating income in accordance with subparagraph h. herein. 
g.  Rebutting the presumption. It may be determined that the base year net operating income yielded other than a fair return, in which case, the base year net operating income may be adjusted accordingly. In order to make such a determination, the board must make at least one of the following findings: 
(i)  The landlord's operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so that the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time. In considering whether the base year net operating income yielded more or less than a fair net operating income, the board shall consider the following factors: 
(a)  The landlord made substantial capital improvements during the base year, which were not reflected in the base year rent levels; 
(b)  Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by uninsured disaster or vandalism; 
(c)  Maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration of housing services; 
(d)  Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding prudent business practice. 
(ii)  The rent on the base date was disproportionately low due to the fact that it was not established in an arms-length transaction or other peculiar circumstances. 
h.  Fair net operating income. The board shall permit rent increases in rent such that the landlord's net operating income shall be increased by sixty percent of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index over the base year. (For example, if the CPI has increased by ten percent since the base year, the landlord shall be entitled to a net operating income which is six percent above the base year level.) Unless the board selects a base period other than the year 1985, the base year CPI shall be the CPI for June 1, 1985. For the purposes of this section, the current CPI shall be the CPI last reported as of the date of the application. A rent increase granted pursuant to this section shall not exceed the increase requested in the application. 
B.  Substantive grounds for rent adjustment applied for by homeowners/residents. 
1.  Grounds for application. A homeowner/ resident or group of homeowners/residents may file a rent adjustment application for one or more rental spaces in the same rental complex on the ground that: 
a.  There has been a discontinuance or substantial reduction of housing service to homeowners/residents without a corresponding reduction in rent. 
b.  The landlord has accepted and retained rent in excess of that permitted by this chapter. 
(Ord. 607, 1995: Ord. 494 § 6, 1987)  
9.70.062 - Rental adjustment allowed for capital improvement, procedure for granting. 
The rental appeals board is authorized to establish rules and regulations defining a capital improvement, determining the amortization period allowed for the recovery of the capital improvement, determining a reasonable rate of return on the capital improvement, determining the impact of a capital improvement on rent once the cost of the capital improvement has been fully recovered, and any other factor or criteria relevant to such determinations.

At the same time, parties to the proceedings shall also be notified of their rights to an administrative appeal, if allowed by the board, and to judicial review of the decision pursuant to section 9.70.100 of this chapter.

(Ord. 612 § 2, 1996)  
Chapter 9.71 - PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON SECURITY DEPOSITS 
 
9.71.010 - Findings. 
The city council is aware of the fact that California law, and specifically California Civil Code §§ 1950.5 and 1950.7, allow a landlord to require a prospective tenant to deposit with, or make available to the landlord, if necessary, a security deposit to assure the landlord for failure of the tenant to pay the rent; to provide for a fund for repair of the premises if it is damaged substantially by the tenant; to clean the premises upon termination of the tenancy and for other purposes as set forth in the statutes. The city council also is aware and so finds that some security deposits remain with the landlord for long periods of time because the tenancy lasts for a long time or the tenancy changes but the new tenant(s) immediately follows the former tenant(s) and the security deposit is left on deposit with the landlord or is immediately replaced so that there is no loss of the benefit of the deposit to the landlord. The council is also aware of the fact that for residential property the advance payment authorized by Civil Code § 1950.5(c) can be as much as to six months rent in situations where the term of the lease is six months or longer. The council is also aware of the fact that Pacific Gas & Electric Company either pays interest on security deposits paid by utility customers required to deposit funds with the company to secure the payment of utility accounts with the company, subject to reasonable conditions regarding timely payment of the account and other related regulations, or returns the security deposit after a year's payment experience with no more than two months' delinquency in the first twelve months.

9.71.030 - Payment of interest. 
A landlord shall pay interest on security deposits placed with the landlord when requested by a tenant at the time the lease/rental agreement is signed at the interest rate provided in Section 9.71.020B after the security deposit has been held by the landlord for twelve consecutive months without a default in timely payment of the rent as provided in the lease/rental agreement. Payment within the default or grace period, if any, provided within the lease/rental agreement shall be considered timely payment. 
Before the lease/rental agreement is signed by the tenant the landlord shall give the tenant written notice of the tenant's right to receive interest on the security deposit so that the tenant is aware of his or her rights regarding the payment of interest before he or she signs the lease/rental agreement. If the landlord fails to advise the tenant in writing and if the tenant would otherwise qualify to receive interest as provided in this section then the tenant shall have the right, at the option of the tenant, to demand or receive interest payments on the security deposit, as herein provided, after the first twelve months of the lease/rental agreement. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing paragraph, the tenant shall have the option of negotiating a lease or rental agreement with the landlord which allows the tenant to waive or forego the obligation of the landlord to pay interest on the security deposit.

The city council declares that no city personnel, no city funds and no city resources shall be used in administering, enforcing or otherwise prosecuting this chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to provide, by city ordinance, a legal remedy for tenants who do not receive interest on security deposits, but who qualify as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. 587 § 5, 1994)  
9.71.060 - Suspension. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, this chapter shall be suspended and be of no force or effect until such time as the interest rate, as defined by Section 9.71.020.B, reaches five percent.

Sections:

The city council finds and declares that trees contribute greatly to the health, safety and general welfare of all of Rohnert Park's citizens and that the preservation and proper maintenance of trees is a matter of city wide concern.

All trees perform these functions for the property on which they are growing. Trees of significant size and maturity perform these functions for all persons living in their vicinity. Trees are key elements in a living system, the boundaries of which do not conform to the arbitrary property lines of individual lots and parcels, upon which the continued health and welfare of this community depends.

(1)  Change in User. A sewer use permit shall not be assigned or transferred. 
(2)  Change in Use. Whenever the use of the premises by the user or the character of the discharge changes materially from that stated in the permit application, or when deemed necessary by city engineer, the user shall file an application for a new permit within sixty days. 
(B)  Change of Permit Conditions. After providing written notice to the discharger, the city may change the conditions of a sewer use permit, including changing the limits or constituents of waste water strength from time to time as circumstances may require. The city shall allow the discharger a reasonable amount of time to comply with any changes. 
(C)  Tank Truck Discharges. A separate sewer use permit may be required for each load of wastes conveyed to discharge point by tank truck. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 6, 2-22-2011)  
13.32.060 - Sewer use permitsTemporary Suspension or Restrictions. 
(A)  Temporary Suspension. A wastewater discharge permit may be temporarily suspended by the city engineer at any time if, in his or her opinion, the continued discharge of the waste or water into the sewer system would, when combined with other discharges into the sewer system, exceed the city's allocated capacity service in the subregional system, substantially jeopardize the ability of the treatment system to meet water quality requirements or would cause an unsafe condition to occur. In lieu of temporary suspension of permits, the city engineer may impose such temporary restrictions, conditions, or limitations upon the quantities, qualities, and rates of discharge made thereunder as deemed necessary to assure that said receiving water quality requirements will not be violated by the discharge to the POTW, or to alleviate the unsafe condition. In addition, the city engineer may suspend a wastewater discharge permit at any time if he/she deems said suspension necessary to halt or prevent a discharge that has the potential to endanger human lives and/or injure the environment. 
(B)  Notice of Suspension. Notice of the temporary suspension or the imposition of temporary restrictions, conditions, or limitations shall be given in writing by the city engineer to the user at least 24 hours before the effective date of any such suspension, restriction, condition, or limitation. Delivery of said notice to the user's place of business within the city shall constitute delivery of notice to user. In circumstances where the city engineer deems it necessary to suspend a wastewater discharge permit in order to prevent potential danger to human life and/or injury to the environment, or in any circumstance that would cause a violation of the treatment plant's NPDES permit, the city engineer shall deliver such notice within 48 hours of such suspension if the city engineer is unable to provide the notice before the suspension. 
(C)  Compliance. Unless directed otherwise on the notice of suspension, the permittee shall cease discharging into the city sewer or conform to the temporary restrictions, conditions or limitations on the effective date of said notice. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 6, 2-22-2011)  
13.32.070 - Sewer Use PermitsRevocation. 
(A)  Grounds for Revocation. The city engineer may revoke a sewer use permit for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure of the permittee to comply with the conditions of the permit; or 
(2)  Failure of the permittee to pay when due any charges imposed as a condition of a permit. 
Notice. No permit shall be revoked by the city engineer until the city engineer has notified the permittee in writing of the intent to do so and has afforded the permittee the opportunity to appear before him within a reasonable period of time to show cause why the permit should not be revoked; provided, however, a permit may be summarily revoked after informal notice by the city engineer if the continuing discharge reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to the health, safety, or welfare of persons. 
(B)  Compliance. Unless directed otherwise on the notice of revocation, the permittee shall cease discharging into the city sewer on the effective date of revocation.

3.  Sewer service charges shall be based upon the estimated actual use of the city sewerage system by the premises or user, except that a minimum charge may be set based upon a minimum monthly usage; 
4.  Estimated actual use shall be quantified based on bimonthly or monthly metered water consumption from all sources but excluding water which, upon determination by the city engineer, is found to not be discharged to a city sewer; 
5.  Charges additional to nonresidential users and industrial users will be assessed for sewage strengths exceeding those of residential users and shall be based on the pounds of BOD suspended solids and any other applicable waste loadings discharged to the city sewer each billing period determined in accordance with Chapter 13.44. 
a.  Special charges may be made to reimburse the city for abnormal costs incurred because of other pollutants in the waste water. All rates including those for seasonal industries shall include in their capital related element the costs of allocated capacity service in the subregional system. Industrial rates, to the extent applicable, shall include provisions to comply with industrial cost recovery provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972. Charges to users for wastes conveyed to a point of direct entry to the city sewerage system by tank truck or other conveyance shall be based on volume, general waste strength, and other cost associated factors as may be applicable; 
6.  Charges for user agencies shall be in accordance with the terms of the agreement between each user agency and the city. 
C.  Special Rates. The city council may enter into written agreements for rates other than those listed when special conditions or circumstances make the listed rates inapplicable. 
D.  Relief from Unjust Rates.

--- (12) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 834, § 9, adopted Feb. 22, 2011, repealed Ch. 13.52, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to this amendment, Ch. 13.52 pertained to similar subject matter. See Ordinance List and Disposition Table for derivation. 
 
Article 1. - General Enforcement 
 
13.52.010 - Intent. 
The enforcement provisions specified in this sewer use ordinance apply to all classes of users to the extent such user violates any provision of this sewer use ordinance or administrative order of the city engineer pursuant to this sewer use ordinance. In order to achieve the maximum degree of compliance desired, the city may use a variety of enforcement mechanisms. The enforcement mechanisms may range from informal administrative action, to a request for criminal prosecution. The city may, at its discretion, implement the use of any mechanism or the concurrent use of several mechanisms in order to enforce the provisions of this sewer use ordinance. The enforcement mechanisms provided herein may be cumulative in respect to such other enforcement mechanisms or civil and criminal penalties as may be otherwise available under the laws of the State of California and the United States of America. Nothing in this sewer use ordinance is intended to prevent state and/or federal regulatory agencies from undertaking enforcement actions as may otherwise be available due to a violation of this ordinance that also constitutes a violation of federal or state statutes and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.020 - Enforcement response plan. 
Rules for enforcement. The city engineer may adopt procedures and rules for the implementation and administration of this sewer use ordinance. 
When the city engineer finds that a discharge of industrial wastes is taking place or threatening to take place in violation of this ordinance, wastewater source control requirements, or the provisions of a sewer use permit, the City Engineer may initiative any of the following enforcement actions without limitation: 
A.  Notice of Violation (NOV). When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this sewer use ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city engineer may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the City Engineer. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city engineer to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
B.  Administrative Orders (AO). The city engineer may issue administrative orders and/or enter into assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for the noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. 
(1)  Consent Order. The city engineer may enter into consent orders, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and affect as administrative orders issued and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(2)  Show Cause Order. The city engineer may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this sewer use ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the City Engineer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(3)  Compliance Orders. When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this sewer use ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge, directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(4)  Cease and Desist Orders. When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this sewer use ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the City Engineer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(a)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(b)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(A)  When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this sewer use ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city engineer may fine such user in an amount determined pursuant to the city enforcement response plan. Pursuant to the authority of California Government Code Sections 54739 to 54740.6, the city may issue administrative complaints, conduct administrative hearings, and/or impose civil penalties in accordance with the procedures set forth in these sections for violation of the city's requirements set forth in this sewer use ordinance. The amount of any civil penalties imposed under this section that have remained delinquent for a period of 60 days shall constitute a lien against the real property of the discharger from which the discharge originated resulting in the imposition of the civil penalty. 
(B)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter. A lien against the user's property may be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(C)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city engineer to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the city engineer believes a request has merit, the city may convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen days after receiving the request from the user. The city engineer may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders to assess the fine. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. 
(D)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.110 - Responding to significant noncompliance. 
Any violation of pretreatment standards or requirements (limits, sampling, analysis, reporting, and meeting compliance schedules and regulatory deadlines) is an instance of noncompliance for which the significant industrial user is liable for enforcement, including penalties per this ordinance. However, the city is required to identify violations or patterns of violations by SIUs that are deemed to be instances of significant noncompliance (SNC). Additionally, the determination of significant noncompliance shall be used as the basis for reporting the SNC to the regulatory authorities and publishing of the list of industries in SNC as is required of the city by pretreatment program standards. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.120 - Publication of users in significant non-compliance. 
The city engineer shall publish annually in accordance with 40 CFR 403, in any paper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance (SNC) with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user (or any industrial user that violates paragraphs (C), (D), or (H) of this section) is in significant noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(A)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(B)  Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC criteria (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(C)  Any other discharge violation that the city engineer believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(D)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city engineer's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(E)  Failure to meet, within ninety days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(F)  Failure to provide within forty-five days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(G)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(H)  Any other violation(s) or group of violations, including a violation of best management practices, which the city engineer determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.130 - Compliance schedules. 
A Notice Of Violation Or Administrative Order may contain a compliance schedule. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule. 
(A)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress or milestones in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events, including the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards or city local limits. 
(B)  No increment referred to in paragraph (A) shall exceed nine months. 
(C)  Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress or milestone report to the city engineer including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.135 - Search/inspection warrants. 
(A)  If the city engineer has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the city engineer has probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of city ordinance or that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection/sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with city ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city engineer may seek issuance of a search, seizure, or inspection warrant. In the event of an emergency that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or if the user consents, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant. 
(B)  To the extent that the owner or possessor of the premises requires that a warrant be received, the city may, in its discretion, suspend the permit and/or any other right to discharge to sanitary facilities immediately, and such suspension may continue until such time as a warrant has been received and the inspection has been completed. If no violation of this sewer use ordinance or the permit, if applicable, is found, the suspension shall be lifted. In the event that violations of this sewer use ordinance or the permit, if applicable, are found, then the suspension may, at the discretion of the city, be continued or terminated, or other enforcement remedies may be sought. 
(C)  The city may choose to inspect the facility to determine compliance with all standards as set forth in this sewer use ordinance or permit if applicable, and additionally, such inspections may be undertaken to verify the wastewater flows and strengths reported by the discharger. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.140 - Emergency suspensions of discharge. 
The city engineer may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city engineer may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or that presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(A)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city engineer may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 13.52.150 are initiated against the user. 
(B)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city engineer prior to the date of any show cause hearing. 
(C)  After reasonably attempting to informally notify the user, the city may take all necessary steps to halt or prevent such discharge including, but not limited to, plugging or physically disconnecting the user's access to the city sewer system. 
(D)  Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.150 - Wastewater discharge permit revocation/termination of service. 
(A)  Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked or users' service may be terminated when any provision of this sewer use ordinance is violated or if a discharge of industrial waste causes or threatens to cause a condition of contamination, pollution, or nuisance, as defined in Chapters 13.08 through 13.52. This provision is in addition to other statutes, rules, or regulations authorizing termination of service for delinquency in payment, or for any other reason. 
(B)  Such users will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.52.020.B. why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city engineer shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(C)  Whenever a premises has been disconnected from the city sewerage system for a violation of this sewer use ordinance, reconnection of said premises shall be per requirements as set forth by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.160 - Upset. 
(A)  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(B)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met. 
(C)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and competent manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the city engineer within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
(a)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(b)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(c)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(D)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(E)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(F)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.170 - Bypass.

(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe Property Damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(B)  A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit written prior notice to the city engineer, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city engineer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The city engineer may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twney-four hours. 
(C)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city engineer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineer judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or maintenance; and 
(3)  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (B) of this section. 
(D)  The city engineer may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city engineer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (C) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.180 - Affirmative defense. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions set forth in section 13.36.020 (excluding subsections (B)(1), (2), and (8)) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
(A)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(B)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.190 - DisputesRequest for ruling. 
If any user or applicant for a permit disputes the interpretation or application of this sewer use ordinance, it may request a ruling by the city engineer, who will set forth his or her determinations on the request. 
(Ord. No. 834, § 9, 2-22-2011)  
13.52.200 - Appeals. 
If the discharger or applicant for a permit is dissatisfied with the determinations so made by the city engineer, under Sections 13.48.080, 13.48.140, or 13.52.190, within thirty days after receipt of said ruling by the city engineer, he shall appeal said ruling by giving written notice of the basis of his appeal to the city manager. The city manager shall, within thirty days after receipt of said written notice of appeal, make a determination of the issue submitted. The determination of the city manager shall be final.

Chapter 15.48 - REGULATIONS OF DEVELOPMENT, BUILDING AND IMPROVEMENT IN FLOOD HAZARD AREAS[13] 
Footnotes: 
--- (13) --- 
Prior ordinance history: Ord. 483. 
 
Article I. - General Provisions 
 
15.48.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Rohnert Park does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Rohnert Park are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
A Zone. See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Accessory structure" means a structure that is either:

The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of Special Flood Hazard. See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
"Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e., below ground level) on all sides. 
Building. See "Structure." 
"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before February 1981. 
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
"Flood, flooding or floodwater" means: 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2.  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
"Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding." 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Article IV of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Article IV of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood openings standard in Section 15.48.170(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.48.170(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.48.170(B); and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.48.180. 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market value" is defined in Section 15.48.140(B)(1), substantial damage/improvement procedures.

"New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after February 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after February 1981. 
"Obstruction" means and includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
One-hundred-year flood or 100-year flood. See "Base flood." 
"Program deficiency" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Article IV of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
Sheet flow area. See "Area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99 or AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

15.48.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of city of Rohnert Park. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for city of Rohnert Park, titled "Flood Insurance Study for the City of Rohnert Park" dated June 1, 1981, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated June 1, 1981, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the city of Rohnert Park. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.080 - Compliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute an infraction. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.100 - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
B.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
C.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.110 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of city council, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
Article II. - Administration 
 
15.48.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The city manager is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develops detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. 
When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.48.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article III. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Sections 15.48.170(C)(1) and 15.48.210 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.48.170(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Section 15.48.170(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.48.170(A)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.48.210(B) (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.48.160. 
G.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.48.080. 
H.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA.

A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Rohnert Park. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Rohnert Park shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Sections 15.48.190(A) and 15.48.190(B) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
Article IV. - Variance Procedure 
 
15.48.220 - Nature of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.230 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles II and III of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.48.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Sonoma County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 791 § 1 (part), 2007)  
15.48.240 - Appeal board. 
A.  The city council of the city of Rohnert Park shall hear and decide appeals and request for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement of administration of this chapter. 
C.  In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
E.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
F.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.48.230(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city of Rohnert Park may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Processing shall be in accordance with the provisions for processing a tentative map as set forth in this chapter. An approved amendment does not by itself alter the expiration date of the tentative map. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.10.110 - Vesting tentative maps. 
A.  General. Whenever a tentative map is required, a vesting tentative map may be filed instead. The words "Vesting Tentative Map" must be printed conspicuously on each page of the map.

2.  At the time of filing the vesting tentative map, a subdivider shall also have submitted a complete application for all other discretionary permits pertinent to the development of the project site. Such approvals may include the following permits: site development, development variances or exceptions, conditional use, planned development or specific plan. 
3.  The processing of a vesting tentative map may take place concurrently with the other discretionary permits required. However, the vesting tentative map cannot be approved prior to issuance of any required discretionary permit. 
4.  If the filing of a vesting tentative map is concurrent or subsequent to a discretionary permit, those plans and standards may be included by a reference note on the face of the map. 
C.  Development Rights. 
1.  Duration of Development Rights. The right to proceed with development pursuant to a vesting tentative map continues for one year following the recordation of the final map or parcel map. If a project covered by a single vesting tentative map is divided into phases, and more than one final map is recorded, the one-year period begins for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. 
2.  Expiration of Development Rights. 
a.  The right to proceed with development of a vesting tentative map expires if a final map is not approved before the vesting tentative map expires. 
b.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the one-year period specified in subsection (C)(1) of this section, the right to proceed with development continues until the building permit expires. 
c.  If a final map is recorded based upon a vesting tentative map, and the development rights expire, the final map remains in effect without the development rights. 
3.  Extension of Time for Exercise of Development Rights. 
a.  If the city does not complete processing of an application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review within thirty days of the date the application is complete, the one-year period specified in this subsection is automatically extended by the time exceeding the thirty-day period used by the city to complete processing. 
b.  Before the expiration of the one year specified in this subsection, a subdivider may apply to the planning commission for a one-year extension.

Chapter 16.14 - DEDICATION AND RESERVATIONS 
Sections: 
 
16.14.010 - Dedication of rights-of-way and easements. 
A.  Every street, walkway, drainage channel, reserve strip (or waiver of access rights), easement, and other right-of-way shown on the final or parcel map intended for public use shall be offered for dedication at the time the final or parcel map is filed. 
B.  When property is dedicated in fee for public purposes, other than for open space, parks or schools, the city shall record with the county recorder a certificate, attached to the map, which contains: 
1.  The name and address of the subdivider; 
2.  A legal description of the dedicated property; and 
3.  A statement that the city shall reconvey the property if the city determines that the public purpose or the need for the property no longer exists. 
C.  The subdivider shall provide rights-of-way and easements for all on-site and off-site streets, utilities, sidewalks and appurtenant landscaping. The subdivider shall pay all acquisition costs. 
D.  If any off-site rights-of-way or easements are required: 
1.  The subdivider shall enter into the city's standard right-of-way agreement which specifies how and when the necessary title to an interest in the land shall be acquired. The subdivider shall enter into this agreement before the first plan check of the map and improvement plans are submitted to the city. 
2.  Before city council approval of the final map, one of the following must have occurred: 
a.  The city has received signed deeds for all off-site rights-of-way and easements; or 
b.  The subdivider has executed the standard city contract for real property acquisition and deposited the estimated acquisition costs into a city trust account, and the subdivider has formally requested and the city council has approved a resolution of intent to use its powers of condemnation to acquire the rights-of-way and/or easements. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.14.020 - Park dedication. 
A.  Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to Government Code Section 66477. 
B.  Requirements. As a condition of approval of a tentative or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee instead, or do a combination of both for park or recreational purposes according to the standards and formula in this section. 
C.  General Standard. The dedication of land or payment of fees, or both, shall be the proportionate amount necessary to provide five acres of park area per one thousand persons residing within a subdivision. 
D.  Standards and Formula for Dedication of Land. 
1.  Where a park or recreation facility is designated in the open space, parks and public facilities element of the general plan to be located in whole or part within a proposed subdivision, the subdivider is required to dedicate usable land for a local park. All park land shall be dedicated free and clear of all liens and encumbrances to the city and shall conform to the provisions of this section. 
2.  The amount of land to be dedicated shall be five acres of park for each one thousand persons. This acreage shall be in net acres and shall not include any public rights-of-way within or adjacent to the proposed park site. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, the following criteria shall be used to estimate population: For single-family homes, the average population per dwelling unit is three and two-tenths persons per dwelling unit; for multiple family homes, the average population per dwelling unit is two persons per dwelling unit. 
3.  The subdivider shall, without credit, provide: 
a.  Full street improvements and utility connections including curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees, and sidewalks adjacent to land which is dedicated pursuant to this section; and 
b.  Fencing along the property line of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land as approved by the director and the city engineer. Dedication of land is governed by the procedure in subsection K of this section. 
E.  Standards and Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication. 
1.  If there is no park or recreation facility designated in the general plan within a proposed subdivision, or the dedication of land pursuant to subsection D of this section is not feasible or compatible with the general plan, or the city has previously acquired the necessary park property, or the city council determines that a fee is more appropriate, the subdivider shall pay a fee instead of land dedication. 
2.  The amount of the fee shall be equal to the fair market value of the land prescribed for dedication in subsection D of this section plus the cost of improvements required under subsection (D)(3) of this section. 
3.  For purposes of this section, the public works improvement costs, subsection (E)(2) of this section, shall be determined by the city engineer based on any increase in cost of construction over the phasing period, as determined for that period by the Engineering News Record Cost of Construction Index published by McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. 
F.  Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication-Fifty Parcels or Less. If the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or less, the city may only require the payment of fees under this section and may not require the dedication of land. However, this section does not preclude the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in a subdivision of fifty parcels or less if the subdivider proposes dedication voluntarily, and the land is acceptable to the city. 
G.  Combination of Fees and Dedication. The city council may approve a combination of fee payment and land dedication when: 
1.  Only a portion of a proposed park falls within a subdivision. That portion shall be dedicated for park purposes, and a fee is required for any additional amount of land that would otherwise be required for dedication; or 
2.  A major part of the park or recreation site has already been acquired, and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site. The needed portion shall be acquired by dedication and a fee required for any additional amount of land that would otherwise be required for dedication. 
H.  Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the city approves land dedication or requires a fee, or a combination of both, is determined by considering the following: 
1.  The recommendations of the parks and recreation commission; 
2.  Open space, parks and public facilities element of the general plan; 
3.  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
4.  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
5.  The feasibility of dedication; 
6.  Whether the city has previously acquired sufficient land for park and recreation purposes; and 
7.  The factors set forth in subsections (F) and (G) of this section. 
I.  Partial Credit for Private Open Space. Where private open space for active park and recreation uses is provided in a common interest development such as community apartments, condominiums, and stock cooperatives, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, the development shall be eligible to receive a credit as provided in this subsection against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees for the value of private open space within the development which meets the criteria of this section. 
Where private open space for active park and recreation uses is provided in a proposed subdivision, the city may grant partial credit not to exceed fifty percent against the requirement of land dedication or payment of in-lieu fees for a housing development in which fifteen percent of the units are set aside for persons of low income, as defined by Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code. Partial credit, not to exceed sixty percent, may be given against the requirement of land dedication or the payment of in-lieu fees for a development in which twenty-five percent of the units are set aside for persons of low income. Partial credit, not to exceed forty percent, may be given for other eligible developments. Credit will only be given if the city finds it is in the public interest to do so and that all of the following standards are met: 
1.  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open area or landscaping required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations are not included in the computation of credit; and 
2.  The private ownership and maintenance of the area is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, covenants or restrictions; and 
3.  The use of the private area is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of property within the subdivision and which cannot be amended or eliminated without the city's consent; and 
4.  The proposed private area is reasonably adaptable for use for active park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; and 
5.  The space for which credit is given is a minimum of two acres and provides a minimum of four of the following local park basic elements, or a combination of elements and other recreational improvements, which will meet the specific recreation and park needs of the future residents of the area: 
Elements 	Acres 
1.  Children's play apparatus areas 	0.50  0.75 
2.  Family picnic areas 	0.25  0.75 
3.  Landscape park-like and quiet areas 	0.50  1.00 
4.  Game court areas 	0.25  0.50 
5.  Turf play fields 	1.00  3.00 
6.  Swimming pool (42' × 75') with adjacent deck and lawn 	0.25  0.50 
7. Recreation center buildings 	0.15  0.25 
 
J.  Credit for Park and Recreation Improvements. If the subdivider provides park and recreation improvements to the dedicated land (other than improvements required by subsection (E)(3) of this section ) the value of improvements shall be credited against the required payments of fees or dedication of land required by this section. To qualify for credit under this subsection, the subdivider must first obtain a recommendation from the parks and recreation commission and approval from the city council. 
K.  Procedure. 
1.  Preliminary and final development plan and specific plan.

16.14.030 - School facilities. 
A.  Fee or Dedication. If a school district has levied a fee or other requirement on development, the subdivider shall present to the city a certificate of compliance from the district before a building permit is issued. 
B.  Elementary School Site. The city may require a subdivider to dedicate to the school district land sufficient to construct such elementary schools as are necessary to assure adequate public school service to the residents of the subdivision. The requirement is terminated if the school district does not offer to enter into an agreement to accept the dedication and to repay the subdivider for the land, in conformance with Government Code Section 66478. 
C.  Interim Classroom Facilities. The city may require a subdivider to dedicate land or pay fees, or a combination of both, for interim classroom and related facilities for elementary or high schools to alleviate conditions of overcrowding caused by new residential development, in accordance with State Law. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.14.035 - Affordable housing. 
The provisions of Section 17.07.020 (N) shall apply. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.14.040 - Bicycle paths and transit facilities. 
A.  Bicycle paths. If a subdivision is required to dedicate roadways pursuant to Section 16.14.010, the subdivider may be required to dedicate land to provide bicycle paths for the use and safety of the residents of the subdivision. 
B.  Transit facilities. The city may require a subdivider to dedicate land within the subdivision for local transit facilities, such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing pads, and similar items which directly benefit the residents of the subdivision if the city council finds that transit services are available or will be made available to the subdivision within a reasonable time. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.14.050 - Access to public resources. 
The city may not approve a tentative or final map if the proposed subdivision fronts upon a public waterway, river, stream, bay, shoreline, or publicly owned lake or reservoir unless the subdivision provides reasonable public areas from a public street to that portion of the bank or shoreline bordering or lying within the subdivision. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.14.060 - Other public facilities. 
As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the subdivider may be required to dedicate land, pay fees, or both, for fire stations, library sites, child day care, public art, or any other public facilities pursuant to, and in order to implement, the provisions of the general plan regarding such facilities when and if such dedications and fees are adopted by the city. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.14.070 - Reservations. 
A.  General. Where a park, recreational facility, fire station, library, or other public use is shown on the general plan or specific plan, and the plan contains policies and standards for those uses, the city may require a subdivider to reserve sites for those uses, as a condition of approval of a tentative map. 
B.  Limitations. The reserved area must be of such a size and shape as to permit (1) the balance of the property to develop in an orderly and efficient manner, and (2) the reserved area to be efficiently used or divided if it is not acquired by a public agency. The amount of land reserved may not render development of the remaining land economically unfeasible. 
C.  Acquisition. The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall at the time of final or parcel map approval enter into an agreement to acquire the area within two years, or longer by mutual agreement. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
Chapter 16.16 - DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS 
Sections: 
 
16.16.010 - General standards. 
A.  The subdivider shall design and construct all required improvements on-site and off-site in accordance with city design standards, detail drawings and construction specifications, as provided by this chapter and as adopted by the city.

The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of this chapter and shall make the necessary arrangements with each utility company for installation of the facilities. The city council may grant an exception to the undergrounding requirements if topographical soil or other conditions make underground installation of the facilities not feasible. 
H.  Access. Every lot or parcel created shall have access to a public or private street. 
1.  Lots located on public streets in zoning districts other than residential shall have the minimum frontage specified in the zoning ordinance. 
2.  Lots located on private streets are subject to the frontage requirements specified in the zoning ordinance. The subdivider shall submit a development plan showing the alignment, width, grade, and material specifications of a proposed private street, the topography and means of access to each lot, and the drainage, water supply, sewerage and the utilities of the lots served by the private street. 
3.  Reserve strips, or nonaccess at the end of streets or at the boundaries of the subdivision, shall be dedicated unconditionally to the city when required by the city. 
I.  Monuments. 
1.  At the time of making the survey for the final or parcel map, the engineer or surveyor shall set sufficient durable monuments to conform to (a) the standards described in Business and Professions Code Section 8771 and (b) the city standards, so that another engineer or surveyor may easily retrace the survey. 
2.  Interior monuments need not be set at the time the map is recorded if the engineer or surveyor certifies on the map that the monuments will be set by a specified date and if the subdivider provides security to guarantee the cost. 
3.  Within five days after the final setting of all monuments, the engineer or surveyor shall give written notice of the setting of the monument to the subdivider and to the city engineer. 
J.  Other improvements. Other improvements such as street lights, fire hydrants, signs, street trees and landscaping, or fees in lieu of any of the foregoing, are required as determined by the city engineer in accordance with this title and city standards and specifications.

The city shall, before approving the final or parcel map, require the subdivider to enter into an agreement to complete the off-site improvements at the time the city acquires title to an interest in the land. The city shall, within one hundred and twenty days of recording the final map, acquire by negotiation or commence condemnation of the land. If the city fails to meet the one hundred and twenty-day time limit, the condition for the construction is waived. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.16.030 - Supplemental improvements. 
A.  Required. The subdivider may be required to install improvements for the benefit of the subdivision which may contain supplemental size, capacity or number for the benefit of property not within the subdivision as a condition precedent to the approval of a subdivision or parcel map, and thereafter to dedicate such improvements to the public. However, the subdivider may be reimbursed for that portion of cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements pursuant to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. 
B.  Funding Procedures. No charge, area of benefit or local benefit district shall be established unless and until a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of this title is held thereon by the city council and the city council finds that the fee or charge and the area of benefit or local benefit district is reasonably related to the cost of such supplemental improvements and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof. In addition to the notice required by this title, written notice of the hearing shall be given to the subdivider and to those who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the latest equalized assessment role, and the potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as they can be ascertained at the time, such notices shall be mailed by the city clerk at least ten days prior to the date established for hearing. 
C.  Drainage, Sewerage, Bridges and Major Thoroughfares. If the city council has adopted a local drainage or sanitary sewer plan or map as required for the imposition of fees therefor, or has established an area of benefit for bridges or major thoroughfares as provided in this title, the city council may impose a reasonable charge on property within the area benefited and may provide for the collection of said charge as set forth in this title. The city may enter into reimbursement agreements with a subdivider who constructs said facilities, bridges or thoroughfares and the charges collected by the city therefor may be utilized to reimburse the subdivider as set forth herein. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.16.040 - Deferred improvement agreements. 
A.  Minor subdivisions. When improvements are deferred, the owner of the real property shall enter into an agreement with the city in a form acceptable to the city engineer and city attorney for the installation of all frontage improvements at a time in the future as specified by the city. The agreement shall provide that: 
1.  The owner shall begin construction of improvements within ninety days of the receipt of the notice to proceed from the city, or as mutually agreed upon in writing; 
2.  In the event of a default by the owner, the city is authorized to cause construction to be done and charge the entire cost and expense to the owner, including interest from the date of notice of the cost and expense until paid. The interest rate shall be consistent with the requirements of Article 15, Section 1 of the California State Constitution; 
3.  The agreement shall be recorded with the county recorder at the expense of the owner and shall constitute notice to all successors and assigns of title to the real property of the obligations set forth therein, and shall also constitute a lien in such amount necessary to fully reimburse the city, including interest as provided above, subject to foreclosure in the event of a default in payment. The obligations under the agreement shall run with the property and constitute a lien against it; and 
4.  In the event of litigation occasioned by default of the owner, the owner agrees to pay all costs involved, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Those costs shall become a part of the lien against the real property. 
The construction of deferred improvements shall conform to this title and all applicable provisions of this code in effect at the time of construction. 
B.  Remainder. For a designated remainder parcel, the fulfillment of construction requirements for improvements is not required until the city is ready to issue a permit or other grant of approval for development of the remainder parcel or until the construction of the improvements is required under an agreement between the subdivider and the city. In the absence of an agreement, the city may require fulfillment of the construction requirements within a reasonable time following approval of the final map and before the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a remainder parcel upon a finding by the city that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for reasons of: 
1.  The public health and safety; or 
2.  The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area. 
If a designated remainder is subsequently sold, the owner must obtain a certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance from the department before development occurs. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2005)  
16.16.050 - Improvement plans. 
A.  General. Improvement plans shall be prepared under the direction of and signed by a registered civil engineer and shall conform to the conditions of approval and to the city design standards, detail drawings and construction specifications. Improvement plans shall include those improvements specified in this title. 
B.  Form and Contents. The form and contents of the improvement plans shall conform to the city design standards, detail drawings and construction specifications. 
C.  Supplementary Plans and Calculations. Engineering calculations, bond or other security estimates and any structural calculations as may be required by the city engineer shall be submitted with the improvement plans. All calculations shall be legible, systematic, signed and dated by a registered civil engineer and in a form approved by the city engineer. 
D.  FilingReview by the city engineer. The subdivider shall submit copies of the preliminary improvement plans and all computations to the city engineer for review. Upon completion of the review, one set of the preliminary plans, with any required revisions indicated, will be returned to the subdivider. If any revisions are necessary, the subdivider shall submit the corrected improvement plans and computations to the city engineer. The city engineer shall act on the improvement plans within sixty working days of its submittal, plus extensions agreed to or necessitated by corrections. 
E.  Approval by the City Engineer. 
1.  After the subdivider has completed all required revisions, the subdivider shall transmit the corrected originals of the improvement plans to the city engineer for signature. 
2.  Upon finding that the required revisions have been made and that the plans conform to all applicable city ordinances and plans, design requirements and conditions of approval of the tentative map, the city engineer shall sign and date the plans. The originals will be returned to the subdivider. Approval of the improvement plans shall not be construed as approval of the gas, electric, telephone, and cable television service construction plans. 
3.  Approval by the city engineer in no way relieves the subdivider of the subdivider's responsibility for the design of the improvements or for deficiencies resulting from the design or from any required conditions of approval of the tentative map. The approval of the improvement plans by the city engineer, or the city engineer's certification that no improvements are required, is a condition precedent to the approval of the final or parcel map of the subdivision. 
F.  Revision to Approved Plans. 
1.  By subdivider. A request by the subdivider for a revision to the approved plans appearing necessary or desirable during construction shall be submitted in writing to the city engineer and shall be accompanied by revised drawings showing the proposed revision. If the revision is acceptable to the city engineer and is consistent with the tentative map, the original shall be submitted to the city engineer's office for initialing. The original shall be returned to the subdivider, and the revised plans shall be immediately transmitted to the city engineer. Construction of any proposed revision may not begin until the city engineer receives and approves revised plans. 
2.  Plan checking and inspection costs for revisions. Costs incurred by the city for the checking of plans or calculations or inspection as a result of revisions to the approved plans shall be borne by the subdivider in accord with the schedule of fees adopted by the city. A deposit, when required, shall be submitted with the revised plans and applied toward the costs.

16.20.040 - Procedure. 
A.  Notice of intention to determine status of affected parcels. The department shall mail a notice of intention to determine the status of the affected parcels by certified mail to the then current owner of record. The notice shall advise the owner that the affected parcels may be merged under the standards specified in this chapter and advise the owner of the opportunity to request a hearing on the determination of status and to present evidence at the hearing that the affected parcels do not meet the criteria for merger. 
B.  Recordation of notice of intention. The department shall file the notice of intention to determine status for record with the recorder of the county on the date that the notice is mailed to the property owner. 
C.  Hearing. If the property owner exhibits to the department a request for a hearing on determination of status within thirty days after recordation of the notice of intention to determine status, the department shall fix the time, date and place for a hearing to be conducted by the planning commission. The department shall notify the property owner by certified mail of the hearing. The planning commission shall conduct a hearing not less than thirty days after the city has received the property owner's request for a hearing. The hearing date may be postponed or continued with the mutual consent of the planning commission and the property owner. 
D.  Determination of status following hearing. At the hearing, the property owner may present evidence that the affected parcels do not meet the standards for merger specified in this chapter. At the conclusion of the hearing, the planning commission shall determine whether the affected parcels are to be merged or are not to be merged, and shall notify the owner of its determination. 
E.  Recordation of notice of merger. The city shall cause a notice of merger specifying the names of the record owners and particularly describing the real property to be recorded within thirty days after conclusion of the hearing.

A notice of merger shall be recorded not later than ninety days after the date when the department mailed the notice of intention to determine status. 
G.  Determination not to merge. If the planning commission determines that the affected parcels are not to be merged, the city shall have recorded a release of the notice of intention to determine status and shall mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record. If a property owner initiates or consents in writing to a lot merger, the department may cause the merger of the affected lots without referring the proposed merger to the planning commission for a public hearing.

A.  1.  No person shall sell, lease or finance a parcel of real property or begin construction of a building for sale, lease or financing thereon (except for model homes) or allow occupancy thereof, for which a final or parcel map is required by the Subdivision Map Act or this title, until the map complies with the Subdivision Map Act and this title and is recorded with the county recorder.

Title 17 - ZONING  
Chapter 17.01 - USER'S GUIDE TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE  
Article I. - What is Zoning? 
Zoning is the process by which the city of Rohnert Park is divided into "districts" identified by particular land use types, such as residential, commercial, and industrial.

Subsequent sections explain how such uses are to be developed and operated. The locations of these districts are shown on an official map of the city, which is referred to as the "Zoning Map." 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
Article II. - What is the Zoning Ordinance? 
The Zoning Ordinance is the document that establishes the various zoning districts, identifies those uses that may be allowed in each district, and provides the regulations and standards that pertain to the development and operation of those uses. In the city of Rohnert Park, the Zoning Ordinance is found in Title 17 of the Rohnert Park Municipal Code.

Article III. - How do I use the Zoning Ordinance? 
 
17.01.010 - Finding a land use. 
The "heart" of the Zoning Ordinance is Chapter 17.06Land Use Regulations. This chapter presents the city's zoning districts in a series of tables, divided by land use type (e.g., residential, commercial, mixed use, industrial.) The tables are set up with the zoning districts displayed along the top of the columns and the land uses down the left side of each table. To find out if a certain land use is permitted in a district, locate the use on the appropriate zoning district table and read across the row to the right. If a letter appears in one or more of the columns, the use is either permitted or requires a separate approval prior to its operation (see below). If a letter does not appear in the row, the use is not permitted in that district. Some of the uses have additional requirements that are indicated by a number and/or a Code citation, and these requirements are listed in the Land Use Footnotes (Chapter 17.07) section that follows the land use tables. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.020 - What does the letter in the column mean? 
If a letter appears in the column for a given use, the use is one that may be allowed in that zoning district. A "P" indicates that the use is permitted and no formal review is required. A "C" indicates that the use requires approval of the planning commission; there would be a public notice and a public hearing before the Commission. An "A" indicates an administrative approval by the Planning Director or a Zoning Administrator; there would be a public notice and the decision could be appealed to the planning commission. A "Z" indicates zoning compliance; these are uses (e.g., home occupations) that, if they meet certain criteria outlined in the footnotes, are approved and there is no notice or appeal process. A "T" is for a temporary use that would either be seasonal (e.g., Christmas tree lot) or would last less than two years (e.g., construction trailer); there would be no notification or appeal. An "I" indicates uses that are allowed when incidental to a primary use. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.030 - Where do I find information on building setbacks, height limits, and other dimensional requirements? 
The "Development Standards" section of the zoning ordinance (Chapter 17.10) contains this information. A table is provided that lists various development standards along the top of the columns and the zoning districts down the left side of the table. To determine what standards apply to each district, find the district on the left and then read across the columns to the right to read the standards. Footnotes follow the table that further explain the standards. This chapter also contains information on allowable projections into yard setbacks (e.g., balconies and patios) and the placement of accessory structures, such as tool sheds and detached garages. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.040 - Where do I find information on how high I can build a fence? 
This information is contained in the "Fence, Wall, and Landscape Standards" section of the zoning ordinance (Chapter 17.14.) This section also contains information on landscaping requirements for various developments. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.050 - Where do I find information on noise, odor, or other performance standards pertaining to a land use? 
The "Performance Standards" section of the zoning ordinance (Chapter 17.12) contains this information. These standards are intended to help protect the public health and safety and to minimize a given land use's impacts on surrounding uses and the greater community. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.060 - Where do I find information on off-street parking and loading requirements? 
The "Off-Street Parking Standards" and "Off-Street Loading Standards" sections of the zoning ordinance (Chapters 17.16 and 17.17) contain this information. Tables located within this section give the parking requirements for various land uses by category (e.g., residential, public and semi public, commercial/retail/office, industrial), with dimensional and development standards following these tables. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.070 - Where do I find information on signage? 
Chapter 17.27 contains the signage regulations for the city of Rohnert Park. These regulations indicate the amount of signage allowable for projects in each zoning district, the proper locations for such signage, how temporary signage may be used, and other requirements pertaining to this topic. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.080 - What else is included in the Zoning Ordinance? 
The other sections of the Zoning Ordinance explain the City's Growth Management Program, the Development Agreement Procedure, Mobile Home Park Conversion requirements and procedure, and Administrative and Enforcement Procedures. The latter contains information on the permits that may be required for some operations, such as conditional use permits, site plan and architectural review for new and modified developments, and administrative permits. This section also explains the City's Code Enforcement Procedures. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.01.090 - How can I get additional information on the Zoning Ordinance and its use? 
Planning Staff is available to discuss the Zoning Ordinance and its proper use and interpretation, as well as to review projects to determine their compliance with the Ordinance. Staff can also review the Zoning Map to determine the zoning district designation for a given property. Planning Staff can be visited at the City Offices located at 130 Avram Avenue, Rohnert Park, CA, or can be reached by phone at (707) 588-2236. The Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Map and related materials are also available on the city's website,

Article III. - Industrial Zoning Districts 
 
17.06.080 - Purpose. 
The industrial district is intended to provide appropriate areas for businesses that manufacture, process, assemble, repair, or otherwise create and maintain goods, merchandise and equipment. The district is designed to provide for the effective integration of industrial areas with adjacent uses, so that impacts related to traffic, noise, illumination, smoke, hazardous materials and other potential concerns are minimized. The industrial district is also intended to foster the development of an industrial base that will benefit existing and future residents of the city and the surrounding region. (Ord. 695 § 3, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 854, § 2(Exh. A), 7-9-2013)  
17.06.090 - Districts. 
I-L: Limited Industrial District. This district allows for campus-like environments for corporate headquarters, research and development facilities, offices, light manufacturing and assembly, industrial processing, general service, warehousing, storage and distribution, and service commercial type use. Retail activities are generally limited to those that support the industrial type uses. This district is consistent with the "Industrial" general plan designation. The floor area ration for this district is 0.5, or 1.0 for projects that meet specific criteria specified in the city's design guidelines. (Ord. 695 § 3, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 854, § 2(Exh. A), 7-9-2013)

Article IV. - Mixed-Use Zoning Districts 
 
17.06.110 - Purpose. 
The Mixed Use District and the Downtown Mixed Use District encourage the siting of compatible businesses, stores, institutions, service organizations, and residences in close proximity to one another so as to create self-sufficient neighborhoods within the city. The district promotes such neighborhood development in order to minimize reliance on the automobile, resulting in a reduction in vehicle miles traveled and traffic congestion. These districts are intended to create pedestrian-oriented environments that provide access to residents' basic everyday requirements, foster an active street life, enhance the vitality of local businesses, and provide employment opportunities close to home for residents of the city. The preferred pattern of development will be ground floor commercial uses, with residential and/or office uses located on the upper floor(s). Special urban design amenities (pedestrian facilities, landscaping, public spaces, etc.) would be included in the district to create recognizable, pedestrian friendly activity centers. On-site parking would be provided for residential uses and parking for businesses would generally be on-street and in parking garages or off-site parking lots. Convenient vehicular and pedestrian/bicycle access from surrounding neighborhoods and transit service would also be components of this district. (Ord. 695 § 3, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 854, § 2(Exh. A), 7-9-2013; Ord. No. 897, (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.120 - District descriptions. 
A.  M-U: Mixed Use District. This district allows for the development of integrated centers that combine a supportive mix of land uses, either within the same building or in clusters of buildings. This district is consistent with the "Mixed Use" general plan designation. The floor area ratio for this district is 1.5 for non-residential projects, and 2.0 for mixed residential/residential projects. (Ord. 695 § 3, 2003) 
B.  DTM-U: Downtown Mixed Use District. This district allows for the development of integrated centers that combine a supportive mix of land uses, either within the same building or in clusters of buildings. This district is consistent with the "Downtown Mixed Use" general plan designation. The floor area ratio for this district is 1.5 for non-residential projects, and 2.0 for mixed residential/residential projects. Non-residential development is required within this designation and residential development is only permitted as part of a mixed use project.

(Ord. No. 854, § 2(Exh. A), 7-9-2013)  
Article VI. - Open Space and Recreational Zoning Districts 
 
17.06.170 - Purpose. 
The open space districts are intended to ensure that land is maintained beyond the city's developed areas as open space. This open space helps to define the edge of the city and its transition into the adjacent rural areas. The districts are designed to preserve areas that reflect the county's agricultural heritage and to preserve scenic view corridors that may be enjoyed from within the city, as well as to protect areas that have unique and/or sensitive environmental features, such as wetlands, vernal pools, and creek channels. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.180 - District. 
A.  OS-ARM: Open Space for Agriculture and Resource Management. This district includes orchards and croplands, grasslands, cemeteries, and rural residential areas. It is intended to allow for greenbelts and urban buffers, consisting of open space, park land, and agricultural areas outside urban areas, as opposed to urban parks, which are located within developed areas and provide outdoor recreational opportunities. This district is consistent with the "Open SpaceAgriculture and Resource Management" general plan designation. 
B.  OS-EC: Open Space for Environmental Conservation. This district includes sites with environmental and/or safety constraints, such as riparian corridors, sensitive habitats, and wetlands. This district is consistent with the "Open SpaceEnvironmental Conservation" general plan designation. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)

(Ord. 739 § 2 (part), 2005; Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
Article VII. - Planned Development Zoning District 
 
17.06.200 - Purpose. 
The Planned Development Zoning District is intended to accommodate a wide range of residential, commercial and industrial land uses, which are mutually-supportive and compatible with existing and proposed development on surrounding properties. P-D zoning districts shall encourage the use of flexible development standards designed to appropriately integrate a project into its natural and/or man-made setting and shall typically be intended for projects that provide for a mix of land uses to serve identified community needs. Furthermore, the P-D zoning process may be used to implement the various specific plans adopted by the city. Once established, the P-D zoning district becomes, in effect the zoning for the area within its respective boundaries. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.210 - General provisions. 
A.  P-D zoning districts with commercial and/or industrial components may be established on a parcel or parcels of land having a contiguous area of at least three acres or, if in a M-U District, at least one and one-half acres. P-D zoning districts for residential developments may be established on a parcel or parcels of land having a contiguous area of at least one acre. Within a specific plan area, a P-D zoning district may be designated for properties totaling less than three acres in size, provided the district is consistent with the specific plan. 
B.  Each P-D zoning district shall include specific development standards designed for that particular district, including minimum lot sizes, setbacks and open space requirements, architectural and landscaping guidelines, and maximum building heights and lot coverage. In establishing these standards, the requirements for existing zoning and P-D zoning districts may be reviewed and modifications to these standards may be made as appropriate. Varying residential densities may be established for specific areas within each district. Once approved, as part of a final development plan (see Section 17.06.250), all standards, densities, and other requirements shall remain tied to that plan and to the property designated by that district, unless formally amended by city council action (see Section 17.06.280.) If no specific standards are proposed for any or all portions of a P-D district, the applicable general standards of the zoning ordinance shall apply. 
C.  A P-D zoning district may include a combination of residential, industrial, and commercial uses within either the same or adjacent buildings within the district, so long as such mixed uses are consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan. Industrial, commercial and residential components within the same P-D districts shall share a similar or compatible architectural theme and maximize pedestrian access between the two. 
D.  In situations where a subdivision of land (e.g., a tentative map) is undertaken in conjunction with the establishment or implementation of a P-D zoning district, such subdivisions shall be processed concurrently. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.220 - Uses permitted. 
Any and all uses otherwise permitted in the city of Rohnert Park may be included in a P-D zoning district, provided such uses are permitted or conditionally-permitted by the zoning ordinance and are shown on the approved final development plan for that district. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.230 - Relationship to existing general and specific plans. 
All standards, requirements, densities, land use designations and other contents of an approved final development plan shall be consistent with the city's general plan and any applicable specific plan. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.240 - Application. 
Application for a P-D zoning district shall be made by a person, or the authorized agent of a person, having a legal or equitable interest in the affected property. In addition to the required application submittal forms available from the planning department and specified supporting materials including the fee pre scribed by the city council, the following shall also be required for all requests to establish a P-D zoning district and shall be submitted at the preliminary development plan and final development plan stages, as outlined in Section 17.06.250: 
A.  A listing of the development standards proposed for the P-D zoning district (e.g., setbacks, lot sizes, building heights); 
B.  A listing of the uses that will be permitted and/or conditionally-permitted in the P-D zoning district; 
C.  A phasing plan indicating the approximate date when construction of the first development phase of the P-D zoning district is scheduled to begin and tentative completion dates for the remaining phases. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.250 - Procedure. 
A.  Preliminary Development Plan. In establishing a P-D district, a preliminary development plan shall be prepared for the proposed P-D zoning district. 
1.  Parks and Recreation Commission Recommendation. The preliminary development plan shall be submitted to the parks and recreation commission for a recommendation with regards to any proposed parkland dedication. The recommendation of the parks and recreation commission to the planning commission shall be based upon the criteria listed in Section 16.14.020(K)(1)(a) of this code. 
2.  Planning Commission Approval. The planning commission will hold a public hearing to consider the preliminary development plan, the recommendation of the parks and recreation commission with regard to any dedicated parkland, and whether the land uses proposed and their interrelationships are generally acceptable and consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan. The commission shall indicate conceptual approval or disapproval of the preliminary development plan. Such conceptual approval shall not bind the planning commission to approval of the final development plan, which shall be subject to environmental analysis and public hearings. 
B.  Final Development Plan. Once a preliminary development plan has been approved by the planning commission, a final development plan to rezone the property to P-D district may be submitted to the city. If subdivision within the district is necessary, then a tentative map may also be applied for at this time. 
1.  Parks and Recreation Commission Review. If any changes to dedicated parkland have been proposed since preliminary development plan approval, staff will schedule a public hearing before the parks and recreation commission after receipt of a complete application. The recommendation of the parks and recreation commission to the planning commission shall be based upon the criteria listed in Section 16.14.020(K)(1)(a) of this code. 
2.  Planning Commission Approval. Following appropriate environmental review of the plan, the planning commission shall consider the application for a final development plan at a public hearing. After the hearing, the planning commission shall forward any new recommendation of the parks and recreation commission with regard to any dedicated parkland. The planning commission will also make a recommendation to the city council based on a review of the environmental impacts of the plan, the appropriateness and interrelationships of the proposed uses, any effects on traffic circulation due to development of the plan, the quality of the suggested site plan design, consistency with the general plan and any applicable specific plan, and other details of the proposed district. A favorable recommendation must include the findings listed in this title for a final development plan (see Section 17.06.260). 
3.  City Council Approval. At the city council's public hearing, it may approve or deny the final development plan or return the matter to the planning commission for further evaluation. If the application for a final development plan is approved, the property shall be rezoned as a P-D zoning district and so indicated on the zoning map for the city. 
C.  A use permit shall be required prior to the construction of any phase of an approved P-D zoning district. A use permit for any or all phases of the development may be processed concurrently with the final development plan. It is the intent of the use permit to further clarify the details of the development phase being considered and to ensure that each component complies with the established provisions of the district. The use permit is intended to refine the final development plan and implement the conditions of approval attached to the final development plan. Use permit approval shall be required prior to final map recordation for all projects within a P-D zoning district. 
The planning commission may grant a use permit, provided that the proposed development phase is in substantial conformance with any approved final development plan for that property and the conditions thereof. In approving a use permit for a phase of the P-D zoning district the planning commission may add conditions of approval, which are consistent with the intent and provisions of an approved P-D zoning district and help to implement that district. For P-D zoning districts containing commercial and/or industrial components, a Master Use Permit may be approved which will generally or specifically describe those tenants that may utilize those components. 
(Ord. 787 § 4, 2007; Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.260 - Findings. 
The planning commission shall recommend approval of a final development plan to the city council, provided the planning commission finds the following: 
A.  Each individual component of the development can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an environment of sustained desirability and stability, and the uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses but instead will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved under another zoning district; 
B.  The streets and thoroughfares proposed meet the standards of the city and adequate infrastructure can be supplied to all phases of the development; 
C.  Any commercial component complements other uses in the development; 
D.  Any residential component will be in harmony with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and community and will result in densities within the P-D district that are no higher than that permitted by the general plan; 
E.  Any industrial component conforms to applicable desirable standards and will constitute an efficient, well-organized development with adequate provisions for railroad and/or truck access and necessary storage and will not adversely affect adjacent or surrounding development; 
F.  Any deviation from the standard zoning requirements is warranted by the design and additional amenities incorporated in the final development plan, which offer certain unusual redeeming features to compensate for any deviations that may be permitted; 
G.  The P-D zoning district is consistent with the general plan of the city and any applicable specific plan. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.270 - Lapse of approval extension and renewal. 
A.  A final development plan shall expire two years after date of approval or at an alternate time specified as a condition of approval, unless there has been any activity in that P-D zoning district (e.g., a use permit has been approved or a building permit issued for any development phase of the P-D zoning district) or an extension has been granted. Preliminary development plans shall expire one year after date of approval unless application for final development plan approval is submitted. If a final development plan expires and is not extended, the property shall revert to its prior zoning. 
B.  A final development plan approval may be extended by the planning commission for a two-year period at a noticed planning commission public hearing, if the findings required remain valid and application is made at least thirty days prior to expiration. The planning commission may modify the final development plan and/or add conditions of approval at this time based on this review. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
17.06.280 - Changed plans and new applications. 
A.  A request for modifications to the conditions of approval for an approved final development plan shall be treated as a new application, unless the planning and community development director finds that the changes proposed do not involve substantial alterations or additions to the plan, and are consistent with the original approval and the general plan and any applicable specific plan. 
B.  If an application for a final development plan is denied, no new application for the same, or substantially the same, final development plan shall be filed within one year of the date of last denial, unless the denial was made without prejudice. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003; Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016)  
Article VIII. - Specific Plan Zoning District 
 
17.06.290 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this section is to: 
A.  Facilitate the general plan provisions for the preparation, adoption and implementation of specific plans in certain areas of the community pursuant to Government Code Section 65450 et seq. 
B.  Provide the city with the ability to require specific plans when the city council finds it necessary and appropriate. 
C.  Ensure that large developing areas of the city are master planned and compatible with the existing community; and, that each phase of a multi-year development is compatible with and integrated into each of the past and future phases of the development. 
D.  Ensure that the extensive information needed by the city to process applications is submitted at appropriate times during the preparation of a specific plan and that early public input is obtained prior to adoption of a specific plan. 
E.  Provide the city with flexibility to regulate the design phases that are inherent in large master planned developments and to allow variations from the zoning ordinance standards and provisions as may be appropriate for a master planned area. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.300 - Application. 
The regulations set forth in this section apply to all SP - Specific Plan Districts. The Specific Plan District shall apply to all areas designated in the general plan for a specific plan and any other area of the city where the city council may determine that because of a project's size, mixed uses, adverse environmental impacts, or other factors, a specific plan should be considered. Consistent with the general plan, these regulations may be modified by the planning and community development director for the Wilfred-Dowdell specific plan area, for which one draft specific plan has been prepared. The purpose of the modifications would be to facilitate final resolution of a specific plan for this area. 
An initiation by the city council or planning commission or a request to rezone a parcel or parcels to a SP District shall be processed as a rezoning application pursuant to Chapter 17.25, Article VII and may be initiated in the same manner as a specific plan or as part of a specific plan application. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.310 - Permitted uses. 
Certain uses may be specifically permitted or permitted by use permit or may be disallowed from a specific plan area in accordance with provisions specified in the specific plan and consistent with the general plan. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.320 - Initiation of specific plans and amendments to specific plans. 
A.  Preparation and adoption of a new specific plan or amendment of an existing specific plan may be initiated by either of the following actions: 
1.  Resolution of the city council; or 
2.  An application from a property owner(s) with control of a majority of the acreage within the existing or proposed SP District or his/her agent. The city shall only process one preliminary application and one specific plan application at a time for a specific plan district. 
3.  An application from property owners who control less than a majority of the acreage within the existing or proposed SP district if the city council, by resolution, determines that it is in the best interest of the city to allow the minority property owners to proceed with the specific plan process and if the property owned by the minority property owner(s) is contiguous to the city's incorporated boundaries. 
B.  If the property for which a specific plan or specific plan amendment is proposed is located in unincorporated territory, the SP district designation will serve as prezoning for the property pursuant to Government Code Section 65859. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.330 - Procedure for applying for a specific plan or an amendment to a specific planGenerally. 
Applications for a specific plan shall include two separate stages. The first stage is submittal of the preliminary application and the second stage is submittal of the draft specific plan. Applications for development within a SP District shall include a development area plan, pursuant to Section 17.06.400. The preliminary application stage shall not be required for an amendment to a specific plan unless it is determined by the planning director that the amendment constitutes a new specific plan (e.g., fifty percent or more of the text or land use map are proposed to be amended). 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.340 - Preliminary applicationPurpose and submittal. 
A.  The first stage of a specific plan application shall be submittal of a preliminary application. Due to the size of the SP District areas and their potential impact on the community, the preliminary application will provide the opportunity for staff, the public, the planning commission and the city council to review the preliminary proposal prior to the preparation of a full draft specific plan. 
B.  The preliminary application shall include the following: 
1.  Completed planning application form and required fee and attachments. 
2.  A general description of the proposed development, including a legal description of the property in the district. 
3.  Definitions of the land use designations (including density ranges and, in the case of residential designation, sample product types). 
4.  Schematic maps, illustrative material and narrative sufficient to describe the general relationships between on-site and surrounding land uses, circulation system, and the intended design character and scale of principal features including, but not limited to, public buildings, schools, parks, and open space. 
5.  A preliminary time schedule for development, including quantitative data, such as population, housing units, land use acreage, preliminary ranges of water consumption and wastewater generation, and other data sufficient to illustrate phasing of development and potential impact on public service requirements. 
6.  General description of possible financing mechanisms for on- and off-site infrastructure improvements. 
7.  A preliminary map showing the natural resources, as well as the opportunities and constraints of the district (e.g., wetlands, creeks, view corridors), including wetlands, habitat areas, and creeksides by a qualified biologist and a preliminary program for conservation/mitigation to the extent feasible. The map shall indicate the potential for candidate, sensitive, or special status species identified in the general plan (e.g., the California tiger salamander), other local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and possible mitigation. Included with the map shall be a preliminary biological assessment, by a qualified biologist, indicating whether any biological surveys are required for potential candidate, sensitive, or special status species identified in the general plan (e.g., the California tiger salamander), other local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
8.  Schematic maps of two conceptual land use and/or land use and circulation alternatives considered in the development of the preliminary plan. 
C.  The number of copies of the application and attachments to be submitted shall be determined by the planning and community development director. 
D.  If the property within an existing or proposed specific plan district is owned by more than oneowner and not all owners join in the application, the planning and community development director may modify the requirements for a preliminary application to require, on a site-specific basis, less detailed information regarding property owned by persons not joining in the application. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.350 - Preliminary applicationReview procedure. 
A.  Within thirty days of submittal, the community development director shall respond in writing to the applicant regarding the completeness of the preliminary application. Following initial application review, the community development director may require other documentation and information he or she deems necessary for the parks and recreation commission and planning commission to make a recommendation to the city council regarding conformance with the general plan. 
B.  Parks and Recreation Commission Report. The application shall be submitted to the parks and recreation commission for a report with regards to any proposed parkland dedication. The report of the parks and recreation commission to the planning commission shall include the criteria listed in Section 16.14.020(K)(1)(a) of this code. 
C.  Planning Commission and City Council Public Hearings. The planning commission and city council will each hold a public hearing to receive public input on the preliminary plan. Additional public meetings and workshops may be required if necessary to determine general plan conformance as determined by the community development director. 
D.  Following completion of the public meetings, but not more than ninety days following the determination that the preliminary application is complete, the community development director will provide the applicant(s) and all property owners within the SP district with a copy of the staff report and any adopted resolutions. 
E.  Preliminary application review shall not constitute any representation on the part of the city that a specific plan will be prepared or approved for the property or that any other application pending or otherwise will be approved. 
F.  Final Development Plan. Once a preliminary development plan has been approved by the planning commission, a final development plan to rezone the property to SP district may be submitted to the city. If subdivision within the district is necessary, then a tentative map may also be applied for at this time. Once the application has been deemed complete by staff, a public hearing before the planning commission shall be scheduled following appropriate environmental review of the plan. The planning commission shall make any new recommendations to the city council based on a review of the environmental impacts of the plan, the appropriateness and interrelationship of the proposed uses, any effects on traffic circulation due to development of the plan, the quality of the suggested site plan design, consistency with the general plan and any applicable specific plan, and other details of the proposed district. A favorable recommendation must include the findings listed in this title for a final development plan (see Section 17.06.260). At its public hearing, the city council may approve or deny the final development plan or return the matter to the planning commission for further evaluation. If approved, the property shall be rezoned as a SP zoning district and so indicated on the zoning map for the city. 
(Ord. 787 § 5, 2007: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.360 - ApplicationRequest for development agreement. 
A specific plan application may include a request that the city enter into a development agreement with the property owner(s) or applicant for development within the specific plan area. To the extent practicable, the development agreement application shall be processed concurrently with the specific plan application. Provisions of this chapter may be varied if expressly authorized through approval of a development agreement. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.06.370 - ApplicationSubmittal. 
A.  Applications for a specific plan or specific plan amendment shall contain the following: 
1.  Completed planning application form and required fee and attachments. 
2.  Two copies of a preliminary title report dated within the last six months. 
3.  A master copy of a draft specific plan or proposed revisions to an adopted specific plan in the case of an amendment, both in print and electronic format, if available. Additional copies of the draft documents shall be submitted for public review purposes, as determined by the planning and community development director. 
4.  A comparison of the standards and provisions of the specific plan to the standards and provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
B.  The draft specific plan shall include the following, subject to the satisfaction of the planning and community development director: 
1.  Text and tables providing: 
a.  A general description of the proposed development, including a legal description of the property in the district. 
b.  A statement of the relationship of the specific plan to the general plan. 
c.  A boundary survey map of the area within the specific plan and a calculation of the gross land area within the district. 
d.  Definitions of the land use designations (including density ranges and, in the case of residential designation, sample product types) shown on the specific plan graphics (as required by subsection 2 of this section). 
e.  A land use program in table format setting forth, by area and in total, the minimum and maximum total dwelling units, the minimum and maximum nonresidential square footage, and the minimum acreage for open space, public uses, and any other uses for the district at buildout. 
f.  A description of each land use sub-area in terms of uses and compatibility, and the zoning district regulations that shall apply to that sub-area to the extend not otherwise specified in the specific plan. 
g.  A public facilities financing plan that explains how streets, water, wastewater, solid waste, and parks, all meeting city standards, will be provided to the project including quantitative data, such as population, housing units, land use acreage, engineering calculations for projected water consumption and wastewater generation, and other data sufficient to illustrate phasing of development and potential impact on public service requirements. The plan must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the city manager, that completion of all necessary infrastructure and public facility improvements concurrently with completion of the specific plan is economically, physically, and legally feasible. The city manager shall base the determination of completeness by reviewing the following components: 
(1)  Identification of public improvements required to complete each phase of the project as well as the entire project in accordance with the general plan and city standards. 
(2)  Detailed cost analysis of required public improvements. 
(3)  Method of financing required public improvements. 
(4)  Implementation and phasing schedule correlated with project buildout. 
(5)  Plan for receiving approval of all regulatory agencies including proposed timeline for submittal and approvals. 
(6)  Evidence of ability to complete improvements in a satisfactory and timely manner. 
(Note: Pursuant to general plan policies GM-10, GM-11, and GM-12, a public facilities plan that provides for the project's fair share of the financing for the necessary public facilities, but does not provide for the completion of the public facilities prior to completion of the development due to lack of contribution by other responsible parties, will be deemed complete but will not be sufficient to receive approval as part of a specific plan unless either one or both of the following exceptions apply: 
(i)  A statement of public policy considerations is adopted by the city council to allow certain required public facilities to be deferred for a specific time period. The statement of public policy considerations shall include findings that specific and offsetting community goals and objectives are achieved by the project that balance not meeting the goal of providing necessary public facilities concurrently with development. A time period shall be specified in which the improvements must be completed. Such findings shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record of the public hearing. 
(ii)  For projects subject to a development agreement, the city council may grant an exception for streets/highways/intersections only, if it can be demonstrated that although adequate street/highway/intersections are unable to be provided for the development at the time occupancy is projected, such facilities will be provided within two years of the time occupancy is projected. The determination that such facilities will be provided within two years of the time occupancy is projected shall be based upon the approved public facilities financing plans submitted by other projects that contribute to the need for the street/highway/intersection improvement.). 
h.  Description of proposed water supply (Note: information will be used toward determining the adequacy of water supply consistent with general plan policies PF-11 and PF-14, relating to water supply.). 
i.  If based on the preliminary biological assessment and mapping submitted as part of the preliminary application, surveys are required, a complete site-specific biological assessment of wetlands, habitat areas, and creeksides by a qualified biologist and a proposed program for conservation/mitigation to the extent feasible. The biological assessment shall include a survey, conducted in accordance with established California Department of Fish and Game guidelines, for potential candidate, sensitive, or special status species identified in the general plan (e.g., the California tiger salamander), other local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, both in breeding habitat and adjacent upland estivation habitat, with appropriate mitigation, including avoidance and minimization measures. 
If a survey has not been completed at the time of application submittal, it shall be completed prior to completion of a draft environmental impact report. A specific plan application shall not be considered complete until any required surveys are complete, except as may be modified pursuant to subsection 17.06.370(C). 
If surveys are determined not to be required, documentation for this determination prepared by a city-approved biologist shall be submitted. 
j.  Proposed program for conservation of the natural resources along creeks and standards for the conservation, development and utilization of natural resources where applicable. 
k.  A preliminary traffic study prepared by a qualified traffic/transportation planner or engineer and reasonable mitigation measures to mitigate traffic impacts resulting from the development. 
l.  An affordable housing program showing how the proposed development will comply with the city's inclusionary housing requirement, if applicable. 
m.  Other plans and programs, as may be necessary, to address general plan and city requirements regarding traffic, natural resource conservation and management, parks and open space (including a description of the acreage, layout, and configuration of proposed parkland dedication), hydrology, drainage and storm water runoff. 
2.  Graphics showing generally: 
a.  Land use designations for each distinct use in the SP district (each such designated area is hereinafter referred to as a "land use area") and in adjacent areas outside the district. 
b.  Public circulation system (including street standards and cross sections, pedestrian paths and bikeways, and linkages to adjacent properties, where appropriate). 
c.  Public buildings, schools, open space, and park. 
d.  A Preliminary Public Infrastructure Plan including the proposed location and capacity of major infrastructure components, including wells, sewerage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy and other essential facilities proposed to be located within the area covered by the draft specific plan. 
e.  A map showing the natural resources as well as the opportunities and constraints of the district (e.g., wetlands, creeks, view corridors). 
f.  Diagram of how the development within the area covered by the specific plan is to be phased. 
3.  Standards and criteria by which development will be phased. 
4.  Standards for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources. 
5.  A topographic map and, if applicable, a general grading concept plan for the property, shown at contour intervals not to exceed two feet for natural slopes over two percent or less. For natural slopes of two percent or more, contour intervals shall not exceed five feet. 
6.  Development standards, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Permitted uses; 
b.  Conditionally permitted uses; 
c.  Site coverage; 
d.  Floor-area ratios; 
e.  Setbacks; 
f.  Building heights; 
g.  Accessory structures; 
h.  Private and public outdoor areas, including open space and parks; 
i.  Parking; and

7.  Design guidelines, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Site guidelines. 
(i)  Streetscape, 
(ii)  Parking, 
(iii)  Pedestrian connections, 
(iv)  Landscape and street tree palette, and 
(v)  Lighting; 
b.  Building guidelines. 
(i)  Porches and entries, 
(ii)  Scale, 
(iii)  Architectural character, 
(iv)  Materials/colors, 
(v)  Landscaping, and 
(vi)  Signage. 
8.  A program of implementation measures, including regulations, programs, public works projects, and financing mechanisms necessary to carry out the specific plan. In cases where the application for a specific plan is not joined by all property owners in the district, the implementation program may address any additional information or procedures required for development of those properties, and may establish mechanisms for the allocation of specific plan fees and public facility and infrastructure costs among property owners within the district. 
9.  Any other information required by state law or the general plan to be included in a specific plan.

(Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), 4-12-2016) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 897 , (Exh. B), adopted April 12, 2016, set out provisions intended for use as Chapter 17.06, Article XIII, § C Limitations on Residential Development. For purposes of clarity and to preserve the style of this Code, at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as § D.  
Article XV. - Form-Based Codes for Special Areas 
 
17.06.800 - General provisions. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The intent of this section is to continue implementation of the guiding objectives set forth in the Rohnert Park General Plan relating to compact urban form, increased connectivity between neighborhoods, designation of mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented centers, development of a variety of housing types within all neighborhoods, and development of a network of trails, parks and land use patterns that maximizes accessibility to parks and commercial centers. 
B.  Definitions. For the purposes of any land use regulations adopted pursuant to this article, the following definitions apply: 
"Development Code" means a set of land use regulations adopted in conformance with the general plan that provide the standards for development. All actions and undertakings necessary for project planning, land acquisition, demolition, or construction of a project must conform with the regulations of the development code before approval. A development code is also known as a zoning code. 
"Form-based Code" means a code that uses physical form (rather than separation of land uses) as the organizing principle. A form-based code is an alternative to conventional zoning. Form-based codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks. The regulations and standards in form-based codes, presented in both diagrams and words, correspond to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of development rather than solely distinctions in land-use types. 
"Regulating plan" means a zoning map or plan that delineate the boundaries of individual zones, transect zones, civic zones, special districts, and special requirements, if any, of areas subject to regulation by a form-based code. 
"Transect zone (or T zone)" means one of several areas on a zoning map or regulating plan regulated by the form-based code. Transect zones are administratively similar to the land use zones in conventional codes, except that in addition to building use, density, height, and setback requirements, other elements are integrated, including without limitation private lot, building and public frontage. 
C.  Establishment of Form-Based Codes. In order to further the goals and policies of the general plan, the city council may adopt and amend form-based codes for planned development or specific plan areas identified in the general plan, or for other geographically discrete areas within the Rohnert Park Planning Area (sphere of influence) as may be specified by the city council. Such codes may provide for, among other subjects, the establishment of building design, site design, and other design-related standards that, once adopted, shall apply to proposed development or in any areas of the city subject to the codes. The codes may utilize regulations such as transect-based, form-based coding, with regulating plans or similar mechanisms prescribing appropriate land uses. Regulations may also contain project and site design principles relating to appropriate building types, housing mix, integration of land uses, pedestrian orientation, streetscape, and public spaces in the subject area. 
D.  Adoption or Amendment. The adoption or amendment of a form-based code, or the boundaries of any zones established by a form-based code or regulating plan, shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures outlined in Chapter 17.25, Article VII (commencing with Section 17.25.070) of this title. 
E.  Applicability. After a form-based code is adopted for a particular planned development or specific plan area identified in the general plan, or for any other geographically discrete area of the Rohnert Park Planning Area as may be specified by the city council, the building design and site design standards and any and all other land use and development requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions set forth in such code shall apply to all development within the geographic boundaries established by and for the code notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary. Whenever the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions of a form-based code conflict with the requirements, standards, regulations or other provisions set forth in the Municipal Code, the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions in the form-based code shall govern. 
F.  Operation and Enforcement of Form-Based Codes. Any failure to comply with a requirement, standard, regulation, or any other provision set forth in an adopted form-based code shall constitute a violation of the Municipal Code. All such violations shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of any applicable local or state law, including without limitation Chapter 17.25 Article XIII (commencing with 17.25.130). 
(Ord. No. 823, § 2, 9-14-2010)  
Article XV.A. - Sonoma Mountain Village Planned Development Zoning District 
 
17.06.810 - General provisions. 
A.  Authority. The adoption of the Sonoma Mountain Village Planned Development Zoning District (SMV P-D) is authorized under the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Rohnert Park (Rohnert Park Municipal Code Title 17, the "Zoning Ordinance"). Specifically, the SMV P-D is adopted pursuant to the regulations set forth in Chapter 17.06, Article VII and Chapter 17.06 Article XV, to provide the "specific development standards designed for that particular district, including minimum lot sizes, setbacks and open space requirements, architectural and landscaping guidelines, and maximum building heights and lot coverage." 
The SMV P-D is based on the authority vested in the City of Rohnert Park by the State of California, including but not limited to: the California Constitution (Article XI, Section 7, et seq.); the Planning and Zoning Law (California Government Code Sections 65000, et seq.); and the California Environmental Quality Act (California Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq.; California Code of Regulations Title 14, Section 15000, et seq.). 
B.  Purpose. The development code serving the SMV P-D is intended to create a well-designed, pedestrian-oriented, economically viable neighborhood, and to achieve the related goals below. 
The development code describes the required urban and architectural design patterns, while also regulating the uses of the buildings and lots within the SMV Planned Development area. The development code specifies the permitted residential densities and intensity of the development that may be achieved under the Planned Development. It also describes and regulates the design of the public space network that provides the framework and infrastructure for the Sonoma Mountain Village property, focusing on a circulation network that balances the use of all travel modes, including automobiles, pedestrians, bicycles and public transit. 
The development code in the SMV P-D is designed to be used both as a guide for builders, to allow them to understand from the outset the parameters that the community has set for development, and also as a regulating framework for the City as it plans its investment in capital projects and evaluates the design of proposed building projects. This will improve the quality of design proposals that the City receives, the speed and quality of the design review process, and the value of the City's cumulative reinvestment in the public realm. 
(Ord. No. 824, § 2(Exh. A), 9-14-2010)  
17.06.820 - Administration.

No Building Permit or Grading Permit shall be issued by the City unless the proposed construction complies with all applicable provisions of this development code. 
b.  Minimum and exclusive standards. The requirements of this development code are minimum standards for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare and may be made more restrictive through City review and entitlement processes, including Administrative Permits, Use Permits or subdivision review in accordance with Title 17 of the Municipal Code. 
c.  Conflicting Requirements. 
1.  Uniform Building Code. If a conflict occurs between a provision of the Uniform Building Code, as may be amended by the City, and a requirement of this development code, the building code shall control. 
2.  California Fire Code. If a conflict occurs between a provision of the California Fire Code, as may be amended by the City, and a requirement of this development code, the California Fire Code shall control. 
d.  Other requirements may apply. Nothing in this development code eliminates the need for obtaining any other permits required by the City, or any permit, approval or entitlement required by any other local, State or Federal agency. 
B.  Responsibility for Administration. The SMV P-D regulations shall be administered by the Development Services Director, referred as the "Director," and the other decision-making authorities as identified in the Municipal Code. All findings, approvals, determinations, or other exercises of discretionary judgment, including without limitation any delegation of authority by the Director or other decision making authorities, shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the purposes of the SMV P-D, the Zoning Ordinance, the City's General Plan, and the orderly development of the City. 
C.  Interpretation. In addition to the provisions governing interpretation of zoning districts provided at Section 17.02.040 of the Zoning Ordinance, the standards, requirements, densities, land use designations and other contents of this Article XV.A shall be interpreted in conformance with: 
a.  The City of Rohnert Park General Plan (pursuant to Zoning Ordinance Section 17.06.230); 
b.  The Zoning Ordinance, including all provisions applicable to Planned Development Zoning Districts (Chapter 17.06, Article VII), Form-Based Codes (Chapter 17.06, Article XV), and all other applicable provisions; and 
c.  The Purpose described at Section 17.06.810 (B), above. 
To the extent any standard, requirement, density, land use designation, or other content of this Article XV.A is ambiguous or may conflict with the Zoning Ordinance, the standard, requirement, density, land use designation, or other content of this Article shall prevail. 
D.  Approval Requirements. Each structure and land use shall be established, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, moved or replaced in compliance with the following requirements:

(Ord. No. 824, § 2(Exh. A), 9-14-2010)  
17.06.830 - Zoning and regulating plan. 
The SMV Zoning and Regulating Plan shows the zoning using "Transects," a term explained below. The Regulating Plan also shows zones for parks and other civic spaces, and the locations where shopfronts are permitted and required. 
A.  Transect Zones. The term "Transect" is used in mixed-use planned developments to define zones in which a wide variety of uses may occur, but which have distinctly different levels of density, lighting, noise and development regulation. Figure 1 shows the progression of increasing density from left to right. The intensity increases from low in the T1 Natural Zone to high in T6 Urban Core. In addition to regulating such factors as building height, setbacks and road types, transects are also used to regulate allowed uses. For example, a detached single family home is allowed in the lower density T3 and T4 but not in the higher density T5 or T6, and a grocery store is allowed in T5 and T6 but not in T3 or T4. 
The SMV P-D contains four of the six transect zones depicted below: T3, T4, T5 and T6. 
FIGURE 1. ILLUSTRATED DEFINITION OF MIXED-USE TRANSECTS 
    
In addition to the transects described above, the SMV P-D has three additional zones for civic spaces: CB for civic buildings, CS for civic spaces (parks and recreational fields), and CP for civic parking (structured parking). 
B.  Regulating Plan Map. The Zoning and Regulating Plan map is on the following page. 
FIGURE 2. SMV P-D ZONING AND REGULATING PLAN 
  
(Ord. No. 824, § 2(Exh. A), 9-14-2010)  
17.06.840 - Permitted land uses. 
Pursuant to Section 17.06.220 of the Municipal Code, this section describes the permitted uses in each transect within the SMV P-D and the circumstances under which such uses are allowed. 
A.  Application. The uses listed in Table 1 shall be permitted by right, conditionally permitted, administratively permitted, or otherwise limited or prohibited as indicated therein. It is recognized that in the preparation of the development code, ambiguity may arise concerning the appropriate classification or permission of an unlisted particular use in each of the various transects. Uses that are not specifically listed on Table 1 or which are not otherwise designated as permitted, conditionally permitted or administratively permitted, are prohibited unless determined by the Planning Commission to be a similar and/or compatible use in accordance with Section 17.06.840 (B) below. 
B.  Approval of Uses Not Listed. 
a.  Planning Commission Findings. The City's Planning Commission shall be responsible for determining whether an unlisted use is similar and/or compatible to a listed use and thus allowed within a particular transect. Similar and/or compatible uses which are not listed in Table 1 may be allowed if the applicant obtains written approval from the SMV DRB and the Planning Commission is able to make all of the following findings: 
1.  The characteristics of and activities associated with the proposed use is similar to one or more of the listed uses within the applicable transect; 
2.  The proposed use will not involve a greater intensity than the use(s) listed in the applicable transect; 
3.  The proposed use is consistent and compatible with the purposes of the applicable transect; 
4.  The proposed use is consistent with the goals of the SMV P-D Article XV.A, the City of Rohnert Park General Plan, and all other applicable regulations; 
5.  The proposed use will not cause substantial injury to the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or their property with the applicable transect. 
b.  Applicable Standards and Permit Requirements. When the Planning Commission determines that a proposed use is similar and/or compatible to a listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in determining where the use is allowed, what permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this development code apply. 
c.  Appeal. A similar and/or compatible use determination by the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council as set forth in Chapter 17.25, Article XII, of the Municipal Code (commencing with Section 17.25.120). 
C.  Multiple Uses on Single Lot. Where a single lot is proposed to be simultaneously occupied by two or more uses listed TABLE 1, the overall project shall be subject to the most stringent permit level required for any individual use. (For example, a lot proposed for development or occupancy with a use listed as P (permitted), and also a use listed as CUP (conditionally permitted) shall require Conditional Use Permit approval for all development and uses.) 
D.  Land Use Table. The follow terms are used in the Land Uses table. Note that an asterisk indicates that the use is subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 17.07 of the Municipal Code. 
a.  Permitted Uses ("P"). The use shall be permitted by right. 
b.  Conditionally Permitted Uses ("CUP"). The use shall be permitted, subject to the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to Chapter 17.25, Article I, of the Municipal Code (commencing with Section 17.25.010). 
c.  Administratively Permitted Uses ("A"). The use shall be permitted, subject to the issuance of an Administrative Permit pursuant to Chapter 17.25, Article V, of the Municipal Code (commencing with Section 17.25.050).

b.  Shared Parking: When adjacent uses share parking, the required number of spaces is reduced by following this procedure: 
1.  Base Parking. Add up the base required parking from Table 2. 
2.  Look up the Shared Parking Factor from Table 3. If parking is shared between more than two uses, then select the largest Shared Parking Factor. 
3.  Multiply the Base Parking with the Shared Parking Factor to get the actual required parking. 
4.  The Shared Parking Factor for Civic and Other uses may be established by the Development Services Director or his or her designee. 
TABLE 3. SHARED PARKING FACTOR 
	RESIDENTIAL 	LODGING 	WAREHOUSE and DISTRIB. 	MANUF. and PROCESSING 	OFFICE and LT. INDUSTRIAL 	RETAIL 
RESIDENTIAL 	1.0 	0.9 	0.7 	0.7 	0.7 	0.8 
LODGING 	0.9 	1.0 	0.6 	0.6 	0.6 	0.8 
WAREHOUSE and DISTRIB. 	0.7 	0.6 	1.0 	0.9 	0.9 	0.8 
MANUF. and PROCESSING 	0.7 	0.6 	0.9 	1.0 	0.9 	0.8 
OFFICE and LT. INDUSTRIAL 	0.7 	0.6 	0.9 	0.9 	1.0 	0.8 
RETAIL 	0.8 	0.8 	0.8 	0.8 	0.8 	1.0 
 
3.  Example Vehicle Parking Calculation. To illustrate how parking requirements are calculated, consider the situation in Figure 3. The block has a twelve thousand square foot retail use at A, and fifteen apartments at B. Parking for the block is located around its perimeter and also at the interior of the block. The block is located in transect zone T5. 
Step 1. Find the Base Required Parking. From Table 2, the base parking requirements are: 
For Use A: (3.0/1,000 square feet) × 12,000 square feet = 36 spaces 
For Use B: (1.0/dwelling) × 15 units = 15 spaces 
Total of A + B = 51 spaces. 
Step 2. Find the Shared Parking Factor. From Table 3, the Shared Parking Factor is 0.8 for residential sharing parking with retail. 
Step 3. Multiply to Obtain the Actual Required Parking. The total actual required parking is then 51 spaces × 0.8 = 41 spaces. These spaces may be located anywhere allowed by Section C, but would generally be located in areas similar to those shown in Figure 3.

Glossary. 
A.  Purpose. The glossary of terms and phrases used in the SMV P-D are technical or specialized and may not reflect common usage. If a definition in this section conflicts with a definition in another provision of the Municipal Code, the definitions in this section shall control. If a word is not defined in this section, refer to Chapter 17.04 of the Zoning Ordinance. The Development Services Director shall determine the meaning of terms when a definition is ambiguous or when a term is not defined in accordance with Section 17.02.090 of the Municipal Code. 
B.  Definitions of Specialized Terms and Phrases. The definitions provided in the Municipal Code shall apply to Article XV.A. If there is a conflict between the definitions in the Municipal Code and the definitions provided in the Article, the definitions in this Article shall control. 
"Abut." Adjoin or border on. This term is used in several of the other definitions. 
"Administrative Use Permit." A use permit which is granted by the City's Planning Department without requiring the approval of the Planning Commission. 
"Adult Day Program." Any community-based facility or program that provides care to persons eighteen years of age or older in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of these individuals on less than a 24-hour basis. 
"Alcoholic Beverage Establishment." A commercial and non-commercial establishment wherein alcoholic beverages are sold, served, or given away for consumption on the premises, excluding full-service restaurants.

"Alley." A public or private way which affords only secondary access to abutting property. 
"Amphitheater." An outdoor venue for concerts, storytelling, plays and other related events with seating, a stage and which may include minor lighting of up to five thousand watts total, a concessions kiosk, ticket sales booth, storage, restrooms and other similar facilities. The venue may have raised seating, a sunken stage or both. Sunshades and wind screens are allowed, but the facility must have a general open quality without major roofs or enclosed spaces. 
"Animal Rescue." A facility for taking in animals for placement in homes and shelters which may provide minor medical services and boarding facilities for up to one week. 
"Auto and Vehicle Sales and Rental."

French balconies virtually transform the adjacent interior room into an outdoor space and are encouraged. 
"Balcony." A partially enclosed, habitable structure, usually cantilevered from a facade or an elevation, providing private outdoor space to an apartment.

2.  Section 17.07.020 R2a. Because the SMV P-D is programmed with small blocks and small businesses, the required minimum store size is reduced in this section so that the location limitations of Section 17.07.020 R2 do not apply for retail markets having a minimum of one thousand square feet of floor area which devote no more than five percent of such floor area to the sale, display and storage of alcoholic beverages.

(2)  The access strip required to serve a flag lot. 
"Lot Configuration." Buildings may be situated on a Lot in different ways depending on the configurations allowed in the Land Use table. These illustrations approximate the location of the structure relative to the boundaries of each individual lot, establishing suitable basic building types for each Transect zone. 
a. Edge Yard: Single family detached house. (A variety of detached house sizes and types are encouraged and allowed.) A building that occupies the center of its lot with Setbacks on all sides. This is the least urban of types as the front yard sets it back from the frontage, while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public Thoroughfare space. The front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings. The rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a well-placed Accessory Structure. 	  
b. Zero-lot-line (Side Yard): A building that occupies one side of the lot with the Setback to the other side. The visual opening of the side yard on the street frontage causes this building type to appear freestanding. A shallow frontage Setback defines a more urban condition. If the adjacent building is similar with a blank party wall, the yard can be quite private. This type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze. 	  
c. Rear Yard: Specific TypesSingle Family Attached and Multifamily (including Townhouse, Rowhouse and Live-Work unit). A building that occupies the full frontage, leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard. This is a very urban type as the continuous Facade steadily defines the public Thoroughfare. The rear Elevations may be articulated. In its Residential form, this type is the Rowhouse. For its Commercial form, the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking. 	  
d. Courtyard: A building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios. This is the most urban of types, as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public Thoroughfare. Because of its ability to accommodate incompatible activities, masking them from all sides, it is recommended for workshops (crafts, art, woodworking, etc), Lodging and schools. The high security provided by the continuous enclosure is useful forcrime-prone areas. 	  
 
"Lot Frontage." The property line of a site abutting a street, other than the street side line of a corner lot.

(3)  Interior Lot. A lot abutting only one street. 
(4)  Reverse Corner Lot. A corner lot the side line of which is substantially a continuation of the front property line of the first lot to its rear. 
(5)  Double Frontage Lot. An interior lot with frontage on two generally parallel streets. 
"Lot, Depth." The average linear (or mean horizontal) distance between the front and rear lot line lines or between the front lot line and the intersection of the two side lot lines if there is no rear not line.

d.  Any modification to the antennas located on an antenna structure that does not increase the height of the structure shall be subject to Administrative Review. 
5.  Site development criteria. The following development standards shall apply to the development of all new communication facilities within the city of Rohnert Park: 
a.  Spacing and collocation. 
(1)  New communication facilities shall be collocated with existing facilities and with other planned new facilities whenever feasible and aesthetically desirable. In addition, where feasible and aesthetically desirable, service providers are encouraged to collocate with other facilities such as water tanks, light standards, and other utility structures where the collocation, is found to minimize the overall visual impact. Service providers shall exhaust all reasonable measures to co-locate their communications facilities on existing towers or with or within existing ancillary support equipment facilities prior to applying for new communication facility sites. The service provider shall provide evidence that the provider has contacted all other potential providers who have, or who are reasonably likely to be installing facilities within the vicinity of the proposed facility and has offered to participate in a joint installation project on reasonable terms. In order to facilitate collocation, conditions of approval for conditional use permits for new facilities shall require all service providers to cooperate in the siting of equipment and antennas to accommodate the maximum number of operators at a given site where found to be feasible and aesthetically desirable. 
(2)  A minimum distance of one thousand feet shall be provided between towers. There shall be a maximum of two towers per assessor's parcel or developed site. 
(3)  A service provider shall not locate more than one antenna in any one neighborhood unless the planning commission approves additional antennas. 
b.  Height. 
(1)  All ground mounted communication equipment, antennas, poles or towers shall be of a minimum functional, height. 
(2)  The height of a tower located on the ground shall not exceed thirty-five feet. However, if a tower is located in a district with a height limit greater than thirty-five feet, then the tower may exceed thirty-five feet if a conditional use permit is first approved by the planning commission. A tower, however, shall not exceed sixty-five feet when located adjacent to residentially zoned properties and shall be setback at a ratio of two horizontal feet for every one-foot in height and shall not be readily visible to the nearest residentially zoned property. Under no circumstances shall a tower be higher than seventy-five feet. If it is determined that a tower requires hazard lights to meet the safety requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or the California Highway Patrol (CHP), then the tower shall be deemed too high. 
(3)  The height of a Communications Facility located on a building shall not exceed fifteen feet above the maximum height limit for that district. 
(4)  Antennas mounted on the side of a building shall not extend above the building parapet. 
c.  Colors and materials. All antennas, poles, towers or equipment, including ancillary support equipment, shall have a non-reflective finish and shall be painted or otherwise treated to match or blend with the primary background and minimize visual impacts. Antennas attached to a building shall be painted or otherwise treated to match the exterior of the building or the antenna's background color. All ground-mounted equipment shall be covered with a clear anti-graffiti type material of a type approved by the planning director or shall be adequately secured to prevent graffiti. 
d.  Screening. All ground mounted equipment, antennas, poles, or towers shall be sited to be screened by existing development, topography, or vegetation, to the extent feasible. Ground mounted facilities are encouraged to be located within buildings, underground, or in areas where substantial screening by existing buildings or vegetation can be achieved. Additional new vegetation or other screening may be required by the planning director or by the planning commission if a conditional use permit is required. The applicant shall use the smallest and least visible antennas possible to accomplish the owner/operator's coverage objectives. (See also subsection e Siting, below.) 
e.  Siting. 
(1)  Communication facilities located on the roof of a building of legally conforming height shall be set back from the nearest roof edge the equivalent of the height of the tower or a minimum of ten feet, whichever is greater. 
(2)  Towers and antennas shall be setback at a ratio of two horizontal feet for every one foot in height and shall not be readily visible to the nearest residentially zoned property. 
(3)  Towers and antennas shall be set back from any site boundary or public right-of-way by a minimum of twenty-five feet. No part of any tower shall extend into any required front yard or beyond the property lines of the development site. 
(4)  In order of preference, ancillary support equipment for a communication facility shall be located either within a building, underground, in a rear yard or on a screened roof top area. Ground mounted facilities that are located within the front or side yard or public right-of-way shall be located so as to be screened by landscaping, in close proximity to existing above ground utilities (such as electrical tower or utility poles), light poles, trees of comparable height, water tanks, and other areas where the ground mounted facility will not detract from the image or appearance of the city. (See also subsection d, Screening, above.) 
f.  Power lines. All power lines to and within a communications site shall be underground. 
g.  Backup Power Supplies. All backup power supplies (e.g., generators) located in an industrial zoning district shall be enclosed within an equipment enclosure and operated in accordance with this section. Backup power supplies for communication facilities located in commercial or residential zoning districts shall require the approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission. In any zoning district, ancillary fuel storage tank(s) to support backup power supplies shall require approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission. 
6.  General development standards. 
a.  Each facility shall comply with any and all applicable provisions of the Rohnert Park Municipal Code and any state or federal agency including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
b.  Certification must be provided that the proposed facility will at all times comply with all applicable health requirements and standards pertaining to electromagnetic and/or radio frequency radiation. 
c.  Interference with city communication systems is prohibited. All proposed facility applications shall include reports, as required by the Department of Public Safety, to evaluate for potential interference (e.g., HF, UHF, VHF, eight hundred mHz). The applicant shall be responsible for any costs incurred by the city, including the costs of retaining consultants, to review and analyze the reports. 
d.  The owner or operator of any facility shall submit and maintain current at all times basic contact and site information. Applicant shall notify city of any changes to the information submitted within thirty days of any change, including change of the name or legal status of the owner or operator. This information shall include, but is not limited to the following: 
(1)  Identity, including name, address, and telephone number, and legal status of the owner of the facility including official identification numbers and FCC certification, and if different from the owner, the identity and legal status of the person or entity responsible for operating the facility; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of a local contact person for emergencies; and 
(3)  Type of service provided. Identification signs, including emergency phone numbers of the utility provider, shall be posted at all communication facility sites. 
e.  As part of project review, the planning commission, the city council (on appeals), or staff may require additional screening and/or landscaping, undergrounding, an alternative color scheme, or relocation of a tower or ancillary equipment to a less obtrusive area of the site where it would have a less prominent visual presence due to slope, topography, size or relationship to public right-of-ways. 
f.  Discontinuation of use. All equipment associated with a communication facility shall be removed within thirty days of the discontinuation of the use and the site shall be restored to its original pre-construction condition. In addition, the service provider shall provide the city with a notice of intent to vacate a site a minimum of thirty days prior to the vacation. For facilities to be located on public property, this removal requirement, and appropriate bonding requirement, shall be included within the terms of the lease. For facilities to be located on private property, since the subject property owner shall be ultimately responsible for removal of the equipment, the terms of private leases are encouraged to include the equipment removal as a provision of the lease. 
g.  A communication facility shall not adversely affect the public health, peace, safety or welfare. 
h.  For service providers, who plan to establish multiple wireless communication facilities within the city, the service provider is encouraged to apply for approval of all facilities under a master use permit application. Under this approach, all proposed facilities may be acted upon by the city as a single application. 
i.  In the event that the planning director or planning commission needs assistance in understanding the technical aspects of a particular proposal, services of a communications consultant may be requested to determine the engineering or screening requirements of establishing a specific wireless communications facility. This service will be at the applicant's expense. 
7.  Operations and maintenance standards. 
a.  All communication facilities and related equipment, including lighting, fences, shields, cabinets, and poles shall be maintained in good repair, free from trash, debris, litter and graffiti and other forms of vandalism, and any damage from any cause shall be repaired as soon as reasonably possible so as to minimize occurrences of dangerous conditions or visual blight. Graffiti shall be removed from any facility or equipment as soon as practicable, and in no instances more than forty-eight hours from the time of notification by the city. 
b.  Each communication facility which contains trees, foliage or other landscaping elements, whether or not used as screening, shall be maintained in good condition at all times in accordance with the approved landscape plan, and the owner or operator of the facility shall be responsible for replacing any damaged, dead or decayed landscaping as promptly as reasonably possible. Amendments or modifications to the landscape plan shall be submitted for approval to the planning director. 
c.  Each communication facility shall be operated in such a manner so as to minimize any possible disruption caused by noise. Backup generators shall only be operated during periods of power outages, and shall not be tested on weekends or holidays, or between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. on weekday nights. At no time shall equipment noise from any source exceed an exterior noise level of sixty dB at the property line. 
d.  Each owner or operator of a facility shall routinely and regularly inspect each site to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in this section. 
G.  DAY CARE HOME, FAMILY.

A condominium consists of an undivided interest in common in a portion of real property coupled with a separate interest in space called a unit, the boundaries of which are described on a recorded final map, parcel map, or condominium plan in sufficient detail to locate all boundaries thereof. 
"Low income household" means a household whose income is equal to or less than eighty percent of the area median income, as published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, and is considered to be able to afford rent that does not exceed thirty percent of sixty percent of the area median income. 
"Very low income household" means a household whose income is equal to or less than fifty percent of the area median income, as published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, and is considered to be able to afford rent that does not exceed thirty percent of fifty percent of the area median income. 
"Density bonus" means a density increase of at least twenty percent (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) up to a maximum of thirty-five percent in accordance with Government Code Section 65915, unless a lesser percentage is elected by the applicant, over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land use element of the Rohnert Park General Plan as of the date the application by the developer is accepted by the city as complete. For condo developments as identified in subsection (H)(1)(d) of this section, the minimum density bonus shall be at least five percent, up to a maximum of thirty-five percent in accordance with Government Code Section 65915 over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density, unless a lesser percentage is elected by the applicant, if at least ten percent of the total dwelling units are reserved for persons and families of moderate income.

3.  Criteria and standards for density bonus and incentive: 
a.  In accordance with Government Code Section 65915, when a developer agrees to construct affordable housing, at least one of the following incentives or concessions, at the city's option, shall be granted if requested, in addition to a density bonus; provided the findings outlined in subsection (H)(4) (b)(3) of this section are satisfied: 
(1)  A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning requirements or architectural design requirements such as, but not limited to, private and common open space, landscaping, parking, minimum lot sizes, and setbacks. 
(2)  Approval of mixed-use zoning within the housing development where it is demonstrated that commercial, office, or other nonresidential land uses will reduce housing costs over residential-only uses on a site and will be compatible with the existing and planned housing units on the site and the surrounding neighborhood where the proposed housing development will be located. 
(3)  Other incentives proposed by the developer or the city which result in identifiable cost reductions, such as one of the following: 
(i)  Expedited "fast track" processing of development applications and permits ( e.g., allowing plan check to begin during planning application process); 
(ii)  Use of redevelopment funds or powers, or other public financing. 
There is no requirement, however, for the city to provide any direct financial assistance, to waive fees and/or dedication requirements, or to provide publicly owned land for a housing development. 
b.  If the developer agrees to construct twenty percent of the total units for low income households, ten percent of the units for very low income households, or at least twenty percent for persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned development, at least two of the above incentives or concessions, at the city's selection, shall be granted in addition to the density bonus. 
c.  If the developer agrees to construct at least thirty percent of the total units for low income households, at least fifteen percent for very low income households, or at least thirty percent for persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned development, at least three of the incentives or concessions, of the city's selection, shall be granted in addition to the density bonus. 
d.  If an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development approval donates land to the city for the provision of affordable housing in accordance with Government Code Section 65915(h), the applicant shall be eligible for a density bonus ranging from fifteen percent to a maximum of thirty-five percent in accordance with Government Code Section 65915(h). 
e.  The following standards shall apply to the granting of the density bonus and incentives: 
(1)  Duration of affordability. If an incentive is granted, the affordable housing units receiving a density bonus shall be affordable for a minimum period of thirty years, or longer if required by a construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, rental subsidy program, the city's redevelopment assistance program, city's inclusionary housing program or an affordable housing agreement. 
(2)  Location and density of affordable housing units. The affordable housing units shall be integrated with other housing units in the housing development with regard to siting and placement within buildings, and shall not differ in exterior appearance of the units. The location of the affordable housing units may or may not be on contiguous parcels within the site. In no event shall the affordable housing units be located in only one portion of the housing development or situated in one building of a multi-building development. 
(3)  Location of density bonus. The density bonus units can be located in geographic areas of the development site other than the areas where the units for the low income households are located, and can be located only on parcels for which the density bonus was granted. 
(4)  Zoning basis. The underlying zoning of the district and the number of units allowed in the district shall be the basis of which the density bonus is determined unless the project is a planned unit development, in which case the density bonus will be determined based on the general plan designation. 
4.  Procedures. 
a.  Preliminary proposal. A developer requesting a density bonus, or incentive(s) or concession(s) pursuant to this section may submit a preliminary proposal for staff comment (pursuant to item 4(b) below) prior to the submittal of any formal requests for approval of a density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s) and other planning approvals such as a general plan amendment, subdivision map, development plan or design review, etc. The purpose of the preliminary proposal is to determine whether the proposed housing development is in compliance with applicable planning regulations and to establish the basis and procedures for granting the incentive(s). Approval of a preliminary proposal does not constitute approval of the housing development, but indicates that the housing development nominally complies with the city's applicable planning and zoning regulations, and establishes the type of incentive(s) or concession(s) and agreement to ensure compliance with this section to be recommended by staff. 
(1)  The following information shall be submitted for a preliminary proposal: 
(i)  A concise written description of the project, including location, number and type of housing units, including affordable units and bonus units, and the planning approval required. 
(ii)  A site map showing the location and general layout of the proposed housing development and surrounding land uses and roadways. 
(iii)  A written request for the specific incentive(s) sought, accompanied by the rationale and accurate supporting information sufficient to demonstrate that any requested incentive is necessary to make the affordable units economically feasible and set rents at qualifying levels. If applicable, the applicant shall identify the proposed use of any housing subventions or programs for the housing development such as State Housing Community Development Programs, redevelopment funds, or other sources of funding. 
(2)  Within forty-five days of receipt of a complete preliminary proposal, the planning and community development director shall notify the applicant in writing what the staff will recommend as to how the city will comply with this section, and shall indicate whether or not the housing development complies with this section and with the applicable planning and zoning regulations. 
b.  Housing density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s) application and approval. 
1.  The request for approval of a density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s) shall be made by applying for an administrative use permit. The procedures applicable to the processing of an administrative use permit shall apply to the request for approval of a density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s). The findings required by Section 17.25.053 do not apply to Administrative Use Permits granted pursuant to this Section 17.07.020(H). 
The request for approval of a density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s) pursuant to this section shall be made along with other applicable related planning action requests for the project as specified in the Rohnert Park zoning ordinance, except for projects for which one or more approvals has been sought prior to the adoption of this section. 
(2)  The request for approval shall include the items specified under subsection (H)(4)(a)(1) of this section. 
(3)  All of the following findings must be made, as applicable, in order to approve a density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s): 
(i)  That the incentive(s) or concession(s) are required in order to make the affordable housing units economically feasible or to set rents at qualifying levels for low income or very low income households. 
(ii)  That design, siting and income thresholds of the affordable housing units substantially comply with all of the requirements and standards set forth in this section. 
(iii)  That, prior to issuance of any building or grading permit for the housing development, there will exist an enforceable recorded agreement to maintain the affordability of the affordable housing units for the duration required by this section. 
c.  Denial of incentive application. The request for approval of incentive(s) or concession(s) above and beyond a density bonus may be denied if the city makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following: 
(1)  The concession(s) or incentive(s) are not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Section 17.08.050(A) of this title. 
(2)  The concession(s) or incentive(s) would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5 of the Government Code, Title 7, Division 1, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
5.  Criteria to evaluate requested incentive(s) or concession(s). 
a.  At least one of the following criteria shall be used to evaluate whether incentive(s) or concession(s) are sufficient to make the affordable housing units economically feasible: 
(1)  A development pro forma with the capital costs, operating expenses, return on investment, revenues, loan-to-value ratio and the debt-coverage ratio including the contribution provided by any applicable subsidy programs, and the economic effect created by the thirty year use and income restrictions of the affordable housing units. 
(2)  An appraisal report indicating the value of the density bonus and of the incentive(s) and of the value of any other incentives. 
(3)  Sources and use of funds statement identifying the projected financing gap of the project with the affordable housing units that are the basis for granting the density bonus and incentive(s). The developer shall establish how much of the gap would be covered by the density bonus, leaving a remainder figure to be covered by an additional incentive. 
b.  Determination of the completeness and accuracy of the financial information submitted in support of a request for an incentive and evaluation of this information shall be made by the city, or by a third party agreed to jointly by the city and the developer. 
6.  Required affordable housing density bonus agreement. 
a.  Prior to the issuance of a building or grading permit for any dwelling unit in a development for which a density bonus has been awarded or incentives have been granted, the developer shall enter into a written agreement with the city for the duration of affordability. The terms and conditions of the agreement shall run with the land that is to be developed, shall be binding upon the successor in interest of the developer, and shall be recorded in the Sonoma County recorder's office. The agreement shall be approved by the city attorney and shall include provisions for the following: 
(1)  The number and proportion of housing units affordable to low income and very low income house-holds by type, location, and number of bedrooms. 
(2)  Standards for maximum qualifying household incomes and maximum rents or sale prices. 
(3)  The party responsible for certifying rents and sales prices of affordable housing units. 
(4)  The process that will be used to certify incomes of tenants or purchasers of the affordable housing units. 
(5)  The manner in which vacancies will be marketed and filled, including the screening and qualifying of prospective renters and purchasers of the affordable units. 
(6)  Deed restrictions on the affordable housing units binding on property upon sale or transfer. 
(7)  Enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the affordable units are continuously occupied by eligible households are not sold, rented, leased, sublet, assigned, or otherwise transferred to non-eligible households. 
(8)  Project phasing, including the timing of completions, and rental or sale of the affordable housing units, in relation to the timing of the market-rate units.

N.  INCLUSIONARY HOUSING. 
1.  Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a housing trust fund and an inclusionary requirement or an in-lieu fee on developers of residential development projects to mitigate the impacts caused by these development projects on the rising land prices for a limited supply of available residential land. The fees will be used to defray the costs of providing affordable housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households in the city of Rohnert Park. The fees and inclusionary requirements required by this chapter do not replace other regulatory, development and processing fees or exactions, funding required pursuant to a development agreement or reimbursement agreement, assessments charged pursuant to special assessments or benefit assessment district proceedings, etc., unless so specified.

4.  Residential development project: Inclusionary/in-lieu fee requirements. 
a.  Inclusionary requirement. 
(1)  At least fifteen percent of all new dwelling units in a residential development of five or more units shall be affordable, and shall be constructed and completed not later than the related market rate units, as follows: 
(i)  In a rental housing project the affordable units shall be affordable to very low- and low-income households. 
(ii)  In a for-sale project the affordable units shall be affordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the above, this section shall not apply to projects which fall into one or more of the following categories: 
(i)  A residential development project to the extent it has received a vested right to proceed without payment of housing impact fees pursuant to state law. 
(ii)  Building permits for residential development projects if compliance with this section for such project has already been satisfied including, but not limited to, building permits on newly created lots where the subdivider has built affordable units or otherwise satisfied this section. 
(iii)  Any dwelling unit or residential development project which is damaged or destroyed by fire or natural catastrophes so long as the square footage and use of the building remains the same. 
b.  For fractions of required affordable units, the developer may elect, at his or her option, to construct the next higher whole number of affordable units, perform an equivalency action alternative which has received the approval of council pursuant to subsection C hereof, or pay the in-lieu fee specified in subsection D for such fraction. 
c.  Alternative equivalent action. 
(1)  A developer of a residential development project may propose to meet the requirements of subsection A hereof by an alternative equivalent action, subject to the review and approval by the city council. 
(2)  An alternative equivalent action may include, but is not limited to, donation of vacant land suitable for housing to a non-profit housing developer, transfer of inclusionary unit credits, construction of affordable units on another site or enforcement of required rental/sales price restrictions on existing market-rate dwelling units consistent with this section, and development of second dwelling units. All applicants proposing the use of an alternative equivalent action shall show how the alternative will further affordable housing opportunities in the city to an equal or greater extent than compliance with the express requirements of subsection A. 
(i)  Land donation. An applicant may donate land to a non-profit housing developer in place of actual construction of required affordable units upon approval of the city council. The dedicated land must be appropriately zoned, buildable, free of toxic substances and contaminated soils. It must be large enough to accommodate the number of required affordable units as indicated by a conceptual development plan. The land that is donated shall include lots that are fully improved with infrastructure, adjacent utilities, and grading, and fees paid. 
(ii)  Transfer of inclusionary unit credits. The requirements of this section may be satisfied by acquiring inclusionary unit credits that are transferable from one residential development project to another, upon approval of the city council and as set forth herein. The city council may approve issuance of a specified number of credit certificates for that number of affordable units provided by a particular residential development project in excess of the minimum number required for the project. Credit certificates shall be issued for specific income categories and may only be used to satisfy the requirements for affordable units within that same income category. If the holder of the credit certificates transfers any or all certificates to a developer of a residential development project, the parties shall report the transaction to the planning and community development director, who will document the transfer. When a credit certificate is applied to meet the affordable unit requirement of a particular project, it shall be recorded at the time of project approval, and the subject certificates must be returned to the community development director. 
(iii)  Second dwelling units. Not more than fifty percent of the requirements of this section may be satisfied through the development of second dwelling units at a ratio of two second dwelling units counted as one affordable housing unit. All second units counted toward meeting the affordable unit requirement shall be subject to the provisions of Section 17.07.020.N.10., Continued Affordability. Second dwelling units shall only be allowed for meeting the affordability requirements for very-low and low-income households. 
C.  The city council's consideration of an alternative equivalent action shall follow the procedures outlined in subsection G.1.a. An alternative equivalent action shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city council and may be approved at the city council's sole discretion, if the city council determines that such alternative will further affordable housing opportunities in the city to an equal or greater extent than compliance with the express requirements of subsection A and that an over concentration of affordable housing in one area will not occur. 
5.  In-lieu housing fee. 
a.  For fractions of required affordable units or in the case of a residential development project that is on less than one acre or proposes ten or fewer units and is not, and has not been, part of a larger residential development project, a developer of a residential development project may propose to meet the requirements of subsection A hereof by submitting at the time of application for a discretionary or building permit, whichever comes first, a request to pay the in-lieu fee along with a report identifying: 
(1)  All overriding conditions impacting the project that prevent developer from meeting the requirement to construct the affordable units; 
(2)  Sufficient independent data, including appropriate financial information, that supports the developer's claim that it is not feasible to construct the required affordable units; and, 
(3)  A detailed analysis of why the concessions and incentives identified in subsection G will not mitigate the identified overriding conditions that are preventing the construction of the affordable units. 
b.  The city council's consideration of an in-lieu housing fee shall follow the procedures outlined in subsection G.1.a. In-lieu housing fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city council and may be approved at the city council's sole discretion, if the council determines that there are overriding conditions impacting the project that prevent developer of a residential development project from meeting the requirement to construct affordable units and that payment of the in-lieu fee will further affordable housing opportunities. 
c.  Time of payment of in-lieu fee. Unless otherwise preempted by law, the housing in-lieu fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
d.  Calculation of housing in-lieu fee. The housing in-lieu fee shall be based upon a percentage of the projected construction costs of market rate dwelling units. The amounts and calculation of the housing in-lieu fee shall be established by resolution of the city council. Construction costs of market rate dwelling units is determined in accordance with the definition in Section 17.07.020.N.2. For attached single-family residential and rental residential development projects, construction costs shall be separately calculated for each dwelling unit and the appropriate fee paid for each unit within the residential project. The housing in-lieu fee required by this section may be satisfied either by cash payment or upon the recommendation of the city manager and approval of the city council, by an alternative equivalent action which will provide city with a value equal to or greater than the amount of the required in-lieu fee. 
6.  Affordable housing concessions or incentives. 
a.  For residential development projects, which meet the requirements of subsection A through the construction of affordable units, the city shall follow the procedures described below and provide concessions and/or incentives as described in subsection 17.07.020.N.2. 
(1)  If requested by the applicant, within ninety days of submittal by the developer of a written preliminary conceptual development proposal describing and specifying the number, type, location and size of the housing development, and identifying any requests for density bonus, additional incentives, concessions or waivers or modification of development or zoning standards, necessary to make construction feasible for the proposed development, including the affordable units, prior to the submittal of any formal application for a discretionary approval (e.g., general plan amendment, rezoning, use permit, tentative subdivision or parcel map or other permit or entitlement), the city council shall review the preliminary development proposal at a public hearing noticed in accordance with Rohnert Park Municipal Code and indicate conceptual approval or disapproval of the proposed development and any requests for additional affordable housing incentives, concessions or waivers or modification of development or zoning standards. Such preliminary approval or disapproval shall not bind the city council but rather shall be subject to the discretion of the city council to modify its preliminary recommendations based upon a full review of all pertinent project information, including any environmental impact report, presented at the public hearing on the application. An application for such a request shall be submitted to the planning and community development director. 
(2)  Complete applications for a residential development project which include all required submittal documents and which include the construction of affordable units shall be processed by all city departments before other residential land use applications regardless of the original submittal date. Complete applications which include all required submittal documents and which include affordable rental units shall be processed before applications including owner-occupied units. 
(3)  Payment of all city-required fees on affordable units shall be deferred for payment, but shall be made prior to, and as a condition of, release of utilities and issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
b.  The city council may consider, on a case-by-case basis, in its sole discretion the provision of the following additional concessions or incentives identified in Government Code Section 65915 which are consistent with state law and the housing element of the city of Rohnert Park general plan for projects which meet or exceed the requirements of specified in subsection A: 
(1)  An additional density bonus or other incentives of equal financial value subject to the city council's review and approval. 
(2)  Waiver or modification of city standards that have a direct impact on reducing total project costs while remaining consistent with the latest edition of the California Building Code. The developer shall be responsible for documenting that the waiver or modification is necessary for the feasibility of the residential development project and is consistent with all applicable provisions of the California Building Code. 
(3)  Provision of direct financial assistance in the form of a loan or grant using trust fund or other appropriate available funds subject to the recommendation of the city manager. 
(4)  Deferral of payment of all city-required fees on market rate units, but payment shall be made prior to, and as a condition of, release of utilities and issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
c.  The city council may consider, on a case by case basis, at its sole discretion, the provision of additional concessions or incentives consistent with state law and the housing element of the city of Rohnert Park general plan for residential development projects which provide at least fifteen percent of the total dwelling units as affordable units. 
7.  Requirements for rental affordable units. 
a.  One-half of the affordable units which are required to be constructed in connection with construction of rental market rate units shall be available at affordable rents to very low-income households. The remaining one-half of the required affordable units shall be available at affordable rents to low-income households. Where the number of required affordable units is an odd number, the number of affordable units constructed for very low-income households may be one less than the number of affordable units construction for low-income households. 
b.  With respect to any particular rental residential project, the city council may, upon the recommendation of the city manager, forgive all or a portion of the affordability requirement set forth in subsection 1 above upon a showing by the applicant that imposition of such requirement on the residential project will cause undue hardship and that such residential project will contribute significantly to affordable housing opportunities in the city. 
8.  Requirements for owner-occupied affordable units. 
a.  One-half of the affordable units which are required to be constructed in connection with the construction of market rate units intended for owner-occupancy shall be available at affordable sales prices to moderate-income households whose annual household income does not exceed one hundred twenty percent of median income. If one-half of the affordable units required at an affordable sales price not exceeding one hundred twenty percent of median income are available at affordable sales prices to households whose annual household income does not exceed one hundred percent of median income, the developer shall be entitled to an additional density bonus of five percent for the proposed development. 
b.  As an alternative to receiving an additional density bonus of five percent, a developer may submit a request for another incentive of a financial value equal to the density bonus. Such requests shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city council and shall be approved, at the council's sole discretion, if the council determines that such alternative incentive will further affordable housing opportunities. 
c.  The remaining one-half of the required affordable units shall be available at affordable sales prices to households whose annual household income does not exceed eighty percent of median income. Where the number of required affordable units is an odd number, the number of units affordable to moderate income households may be one greater than the number affordable at or below eighty percent of median income. 
9.  Basic requirements for owner-occupied and rental affordable units. 
Affordable units shall be comparable in number of bedrooms, exterior appearance and overall quality of construction to market rate units in the same residential project. Subject to the approval of the planning and community development director and city manager, square footage of affordable units and interior features in affordable units may not be the same as or equivalent to those in market rate units in the same residential project, so long as they are of good quality and are consistent with contemporary standards for new housing. Affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the residential project, or, subject to the approval of the planning and community development director and city manager, may be clustered within the residential project when this furthers affordable housing opportunities. 
10.  Continued affordability. 
a.  Prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy or approval of the final inspection for affordable units, regulatory agreements and, if the affordable units are owner-occupied, resale restrictions, deed restrictions, deeds of trust and/or other documents, all of which must be acceptable to the city manager and consistent with the requirements of this chapter, shall be recorded against parcels having such affordable units and shall be effective for a minimum of fifty-five years with respect to each affordable rental unit and a minimum of forty-five years with respect to each owner-occupied unit. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section: (1) the maximum sales price permitted on resale of an affordable unit intended for owner-occupancy shall not exceed the seller's purchase price, adjusted for the percentage increase in median income since the seller's purchase, plus the value of substantial structural or permanent fixed improvements to the property, plus the cost of reasonable seller's broker fee as determined by the city manager; (2) the resale restrictions shall provide that in the event of the sale of an affordable unit intended for owner-occupancy, the city shall have the right to purchase or assign its right to purchase such affordable unit at the maximum price which could be charged to an eligible household. 
c.  No household shall be permitted to occupy an affordable unit, or purchase an affordable unit for owner-occupancy, unless the city or its designee has approved the household's eligibility, or has failed to make a determination of eligibility within the time or other limits provided by a regulatory agreement or resale restrictions if the city or its designee maintains a list of eligible households, households selected to occupy affordable units shall be selected first from that list to the extent provided in the regulatory agreement or resale restrictions.

a.  No temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, final inspection approved or release of utilities authorized for any new dwelling unit in a residential development project until the developer has satisfactorily completed the requirements hereunder, i.e., on-site construction of affordable units, alternative equivalent action(s) or payment of the housing in-lieu fee. 
b.  No temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, final inspection approved or release of utilities authorized for a dwelling unit described as exempt from the requirements of this chapter in subsection A above until the developer has made a showing acceptable to the city manager that such an exemption is appropriate. 
14.  Enforcement Provisions. 
a.  It is unlawful, a public nuisance and a misdemeanor for any person to sell or rent an affordable unit at a price or rent exceeding the maximum allowed under this chapter or to a household not qualified under this chapter, and such person shall be subject to a five hundred dollar fine per month from the date of original noncompliance until the affordable unit is in compliance with this section. 
b.  The Rohnert Park city attorney's office or the Sonoma County district attorney, as appropriate, shall be authorized to abate violations of this chapter and to enforce the provisions of this chapter and all implementing regulatory agreements and resale controls placed on affordable units by civil action, injunctive relief, and any other proceeding or method permitted by law. 
c.  The remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall not preclude the city from any other remedy or relief to which it otherwise would be entitled under law or equity. 
15.  Adjustment. 
a.  A developer of any project subject to the requirements of this chapter may appeal to the city council for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of the requirements based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the impact of the development and either the amount of the fee charged or the inclusionary requirement. 
b.  A developer subject to the requirements of this chapter who has received an approved tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval and who submits a new or revised tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval for the same property may appeal for a reduction, adjustment or waiver of the requirements with respect to the number of lots or square footage of construction previously approved. 
c.  Any such appeal shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk not later than ten calendar days before the first public hearing on any discretionary approval or permit for the development, or if no such discretionary approval or permit is required, or if the action complained of occurs after the first public hearing on such permit or approval, the appeal shall be filed within ten calendar days after payment of the fees objected to. 
d.  The appeal shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the claim of waiver, reduction, or adjustment.

e.  No waiver shall be approved by the city council for a new tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval on property with an approved tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary permit unless the council finds that the new tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval is superior to the approved project both in its design and its mitigation of environmental impacts. The decision of the council shall be final. If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted, any change in the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment, or reduction of the fee or inclusionary requirement.

Editor's note Ord. No. 901 , § 4, adopted Nov. 22, 2016, repealed the former Ch. 17.10, §§ 17.10.01017.10.080, and enacted a new Ch. 17.10 as set out herein. The former Ch. 17.10 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 695 § 3, adopted in 2003; and Ord. No. 844, § 2(Exh. A), adopted Mar. 13, 2012. 
 
17.10.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the development standards for the zoning districts within the city of Rohnert Park. The development standards table gives the required site area and dimensional requirements for lots within each district, including maximum building heights, minimum building setbacks, minimum open space requirements, floor area ratios, and maximum lot coverages. Following the table are additional standards, dimensional requirements and exceptions. ( Ord. No. 901 , § 4(Exh. A), 11-22-2016)  
17.10.020 - Development standards table. 
The following table and text are adopted as the city's basic development standards for the zoning districts within the city of Rohnert Park. To use the chart, find the appropriate zoning district on the left-hand side of the table. Read across the row for the zone in question and the development standards for that zone will appear in the corresponding columns. If a number appears in parentheses in the table, a further qualifier, requirement, or exception is listed by that number in the following listing of footnotes.

DTR-H (Downtown High Density Residential) 	Not applicable 
 
B.  Floor Area Ratio Increase. The planning commission may allow an increase in the floor area ratio factor (FAR) for a residential property within an R-L or R-M district, subject to the granting of a use permit, in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.25.050, Administrative Permit, if the following findings can be made: 
1.  The maximum lot coverage for the property would not exceed that permitted for the zoning district; 
2.  The required setbacks and height limitations of the zoning district can be met for all structures; 
3.  A usable outdoor area (at least one minimum dimension of fifteen feet) for residents would be maintained on the lot; 
4.  The issuance of the use permit would not infringe on the privacy or light and air easements of adjacent properties; 
5.  The total FAR for the lot would not exceed 0.55. 
C.  Addition of Bedrooms to R-L District Parcels. For the addition or creation of a sixth bedroom on a parcel in the R-L District, an administrative permit shall be required in accordance with Section 17.25.050 of this title. 
1.  For the addition or creation of any bedroom in excess of six bedrooms, an administrative permit shall also be required. 
2.  Any approval under this subsection shall include the requirement that for each additional bedroom, one additional off-street non-tandem parking space to be located in the front yard or street side yard shall be required. In no case shall said additional space(s) cause more than forty percent of a lot's front yard to be devoted to parking. 
3.  The addition or creation of any bedroom and additional off-street parking space(s) required by this subsection shall otherwise comply with all applicable provisions of this title. 
4.  Under this subsection, "bedroom" shall mean any habitable space in a dwelling unit other than a kitchen or living room that is intended for or capable of being used for sleeping with a door that closes the room off from other common space such as living and kitchen areas that is at least seventy square feet in area, exclusive of closets and other appurtenant space, and meets building code standards for egress, light and ventilation. A room identified as a den, library, loft, dining room, study, office, or other extra room that satisfies this definition will be considered a bedroom for the purposes of applying this requirement.

A.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide reasonable accommodations in the city's zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices when needed to provide an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
This section provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures. 
B.  Reasonable Accommodation. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative or any entity, when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A person with a qualifying disability under the Acts. Generally, a person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major live activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. The proceeding definition of a person with a disability and this section are intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts as they may be amended from time to time. 
A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing- related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in the manner prescribed by Section 17.10.080.C, Process. 
C.  Process. 
(1)  Applicant. A request for a reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with a disability. 
(2)  Application. An application for a reasonable accommodation shall be made on an application form provided by the planning division. If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the city will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. 
(3)  Review With Other Land Use Applications or Discretionary Permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval (including but not limited to; conditional use permit, design review, general plan amendment, zone change, etc.), the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval. The processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the joint processing of both the reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit. 
(4)  Required Submittals. An application for a reasonable accommodation shall include the following: 
a.  Documentation that the applicant is: (i) a person with a disability; (ii) applying on behalf of one or more persons with a disability; or (iii) a developer or provider of housing for one or more persons with a disability. 
b.  The name and address of the individual(s) requesting the reasonable accommodation. 
c.  The name and address of the property owner(s). 
d.  The address of the property for which accommodation is requested. 
e.  The current use of the property. 
f.  A description of the reasonable accommodation requested by the applicant and why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual. 
g.  Where applicable, documentation that the requested accommodation is designed and constructed pursuant to Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations to allow access, circulation and full use of the building and facilities by persons with disabilities. 
(5)  The planning director may request additional information from the applicant if the application does not provide sufficient information for the city to make the findings required in subsection E. 
D.  Review Authority. 
(1)  Development Services Director. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the development services director (director), or his designee if the request for reasonable accommodation is not filed concurrently with another discretionary permit or approval. 
(2)  Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use application. 
E.  Review Procedure. 
(1)  Director Review. The director, or his designee, shall make a written determination within 45 days and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 17.10.080.F., Findings and Decision. 
(2)  Other Reviewing Authority. The written determination on whether to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made by the authority responsible for reviewing the discretionary land use application in compliance with the applicable review procedure for the discretionary review. The written determination to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in accordance with Section 17.10.080.F, Findings and Decision. 
F.  Findings and Decision. 
(1)  Findings. The written decision to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for approval: 
a.  The housing that is the subject of the request will be used by an individual with a disability under the Acts. 
b.  The request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts. 
c.  The requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city as "undue financial or administrative burden" is defined in the Acts. 
d.  The requested reasonable accommodation would not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning, as "fundamental alteration" is defined in the Acts. 
e.  The requested reasonable accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
(2)  Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection F(1) above. In making the findings in subsection F(1) above, the reviewing authority may approve alternative reasonable accommodations which provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant. 
G.  Appeal of Determination. A determination by the reviewing authority to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation may be appealed to the planning commission. However, if the reviewing authority was the planning commission, a decision to grant or deny a request for a reasonable accommodation may be appealed to the city council.

17.16.035 - Unspecified uses. 
Where a given use is not specified in the above table, the planning and community development director shall determine the equivalent use and the number of parking spaces required. In order to make this determination, the planning and community development director may require the submission of survey data from the applicant or direct a parking study to be conducted at the applicant's expense. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.16.040 - Parking exemptions. 
A.  A reduction of up to twenty-five percent of the spaces required for a combination of uses may be allowed where findings are made indicating that the uses share a common parking area and the demand for parking occurs over different time periods, thereby making the full requirement unnecessary. 
B.  Parking space reductions of up to ten percent may be permitted by the planning manager or designee, if a rideshare, transit incentive program, or other transportation system management program is provided. Further parking space reductions up to a maximum of twenty-five percent may be permitted if approved by the planning commission through issuance of a conditional use permit. 
C.  Garage Conversions. The planning manager may grant exemptions to the off-street covered parking requirements for a single-family residential property subject to the granting of an administrative permit, in accord with the provisions of Section 17.25 Article V if the following findings can be made: 
1.  The principal use of the lot is an existing single-family residence without an accessory dwelling unit; 
2.  The garage conversion shall require that the resulting eliminated off-street covered parking be replaced with one non-tandem parking space per lot, other than those existing in the driveway; 
3.  Such replacement space may be located in the required front yard or street side yard if the planning manager finds that in so doing there is neither an appreciable impairment of pedestrian safety nor any reduction in the attractiveness of the neighborhood. In no case shall the replacement space cause more than fifty percent of the lot's front yard to be devoted to parking; 
4.  Such replacement space shall not be rented; 
5.  Such replacement space shall be paved with an approved, all-weather surface; 
6.  The provision and maintenance of such replacement space shall be the continuing obligation of the property owner; 
7.  No more than one additional room, exclusive of closets and similar appurtenant spaces, shall be created by a garage conversion, and a garage that is subject to the garage conversion under this subsection shall not be converted into an accessory dwelling unit; 
8.  The garage door shall remain in place and look functional; and 
9.  The lot must be a minimum width of fifty feet and there must be room for at least one on-street parking space on the curb in front of the lot. 
D.  If an existing parking lot does not provide adequate parking spaces for the disabled and cannot otherwise be reconfigured to achieve the city's required inventory of parking spaces, the planning and community development director may approve a reduction in the number of parking spaces by up to a maximum of three parking spaces or a total of ten percent, whichever is less, in order to accommodate required disabled parking.

Chapter 17.19 - GROWTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
 
17.19.010 - Intent. 
It is the intent of this chapter to: 
A.  Encourage a cohesive pattern of urbanization that balances competing interests, including the need for additional housing and related development, and the expressed community desire to preserve open space, maintain community character, and ensure that adequate public facilities and resources, such as water and wastewater, are available to serve new and existing development; 
B.  Ensure all new development provides the necessary infrastructure and public facilities required to support the development; 
C.  Provide the framework to phase and pace growth so as to minimize its environmental, social, and fiscal impacts, and ensure concurrency between growth, infrastructure and services; 
D.  Provide for the accommodation of the city's fair-share housing allocations to meet the needs of all segments of the community; 
E.  Establish a growth management program for the city of Rohnert Park that is consistent with the general plan, including the urban growth boundary measure approved by the voters in November, 2000. 
(Ord. 755 § 2, 2006; Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.19.015 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to assure that the rate of population growth will not exceed the average annual growth rates established in the general plan, and as outlined below, so new residential development and mixed-use developments with a residential component occur concurrently with necessary infrastructure and public service improvements. By monitoring and managing the city's residential development, this chapter furthers the following general plan goals: 
A.  Maintain a compact urban form, with defined urban growth boundary and urban development intensities in land designated for urban uses. 
B.  Promote a balanced land use program and increase the ability of people to live and work in the city. 
C.  Require preparation of specific plans for strategic new growth areas with complex land use programs. 
D.  Maintain land use patterns that maximize residents' accessibility to parks, open space, and neighborhood shopping centers. 
E.  Maintain a balance of land uses and a variety of housing types over time.

17.19.020 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words, phrases, and terms shall have the meanings set forth herein. Words not defined shall be given their common and ordinary meaning. 
A.  "Final discretionary approval" means the last action by the city that calls for the exercise of judgment in deciding whether to approve and/or how to carry out (e.g., project phasing) a residential project or a mixed-use project with a residential component. Examples include, but are not limited to approvals of conditional use permits, tentative maps, development agreements, annexations, rezonings, and architectural/site design reviews. 
Multiple Discretionary Approvals. For purposes of determining the date of final discretionary approval for a project with multiple discretionary approvals, the action establishing a certain number of residential units shall be considered the date of final discretionary approval. For subdivision developments, this action would be tentative map approval by the planning commission. For non-subdivision development, this action will usually be architectural/site design review. 
Project Appeals. If a project approval is appealed and the approval is upheld, the original approval date (e.g., date of planning commission approval) is the final discretionary approval. If a project is denied, but approved on appeal, the approval date is the final discretionary approval (e.g., date of city council action). 
B.  "Final map" means the same as used in Chapter 16.14 of this code. 
C.  "Model home" means a residential unit used as an interim office/showroom/sales center for a residential development and not as a dwelling. The number of model homes allowed for any phase of a residential development shall not exceed six units. 
D.  "Residential building permit implementation" means construction of the dwelling unit that a building permit pertains to and is deemed to take place one year after the permit is issued. 
E.  "Trigger cap" means the threshold at which a cap on residential development will be established. Its purpose is to maintain an average population growth rate of one percent per year. 
F.  "Urban development" means development requiring one or more basic municipal services including, but not limited to, water service, sewer, improved storm drainage systems, fire hydrants, and other physical public facilities and services; provided, however, that open space uses, parks, agricultural uses, community fields, and golf courses beyond the urban growth boundary that are provided for municipal or public services, shall not be defined as "urban development." 
G.  "Urban growth boundary (UGB)" means the line within which all urban development is to be contained within a specified time period (e.g., twenty years). It represents the ultimate edge of urban uses for the city of Rohnert Park. 
(Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.19.030 - Annual policy review. 
Not later than May 31 of each year, the city council shall conduct an annual review of the growth management program. 
A.  The purpose of the review shall be to: 
1.  Determine the consistency of the growth management program with the goal of one percent average annual population growth rate, a balanced land use program, accommodation of the city's fair-share housing allocations, development patterns and growth area priorities, infrastructure availability, and land use programs as well as with the goals, plans, and policies of the general plan and state housing, planning, and zoning law; 
2.  Review the phasing and pace of residential development (see Section 17.19.040 of this chapter). If, as a result of this review the trigger cap is implemented, as provided in subsection 17.19.050(B) of this chapter, the city council may adopt a resolution establishing priority residential development areas (as described in Section 17.19.060 of this chapter) and allocating residential units in accordance with the standards established in Section 17.19.060 of this chapter. 
3.  Ensure that the development in each specific plan area is coordinated with the growth management program. 
B.  The review shall include a report from the planning and community development director to the city council listing: 
1.  The number of units included in final discretionary approvals granted for each of the five previous calendar years by lands within the July 2000 city limits and by specific plan area as identified in the general plan; 
2.  The number of units included in final map filings for each of the five previous calendar years by lands within the July 2000 city limits and by specific plan area as identified in the general plan; 
3.  The number of building permits approved for each of the five previous calendar years by lands within the July 2000 city limits and by specific plan area as identified in the general plan; 
4.  Projected housing units by year per approved and pending development agreements; 
5.  Applications pending for new residential units or mixed-use development with a residential component, with a time schedule for final discretionary approvals, final map filings, and residential building permit issuance; 
6.  The following types of projects shall be listed separately and shall not be included in the housing counts in the calculation of the trigger cap: 
(a)  Single-family dwellings on legal lots of record within the July 2000 city limits that are not within an approved subdivision; 
(b)  Housing that is affordable to low- and very-low income households, and housing that is affordable to moderate-income households under the city's inclusionary housing requirements; 
(c)  Second dwelling units; 
(d)  Conversions of mobile homes or apartments to condominium ownership where no new units are created or spaces are proposed; 
(e)  Rehabilitation, remodel or replacement of existing housing; and 
(f)  Model homes, until certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(g)  Residential infill projects or portions thereof that can establish to the satisfaction of the city engineer that: 
(1)  Adequate public resources, such as water and wastewater, are available, 
(2)  No amendment to any then existing water supply assessment or general plan adopted by the city is required, and 
(3)  Which consist of any one of the following: 
(i)  Listed in the quantified objectives of the city's housing element; 
(ii)  Adaptive reuse projects (i.e. the redevelopment of an existing property from a non-residential use to a residential use); 
(iii)  Transit oriented development; 
(iv)  Live/Work projects; 
(v)  Residential projects developed on commercial properties that have mixed-use components or are under five acres in size or one hundred units or less; 
(vi)  Smaller residential projects (e.g., under five acres in size or one hundred units); or 
(vii)  Special Needs units (e.g., single-family units designed for disabled residents). 
(Ord. 755 § 3, 2006; Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.19.040 - Phasing and pace of developmentFacts and assumptions. 
The phasing and pace of development shall be managed, as outlined below, to maintain an average approximate population growth of one percent. The implementation of the trigger cap is based upon the following facts and assumptions: 
A.  1.  Residential building permit implementation for new residential units shall be used to make the calculations required by Section 17.19.050 of this chapter to determine if a cap has been triggered and for setting the cap, if triggered. For purposes of this chapter, "Residential building permit implementation" shall occur one year after the issuance of the building permit for a given residential dwelling unit. 
2.  An applicant for a final discretionary approval shall submit a phasing plan that identifies the years in which residential building permits are expected to be implemented for the development. 
3.  For final discretionary approvals occurring in years that no residential development cap is in place, a condition shall be imposed on the final discretionary approval that the first residential building permit shall be obtained within three years of the date of the final discretionary approval, and that any subsequent residential building permits shall be applied for in accordance with the phasing plan approved pursuant to subsection (A)(2) of this section. If a residential building permit application is not filed in accordance with the time periods set forth in this section, the issuance of residential building permits for the development shall be subject to subsection 17.19.060(A) of this chapter, if a residential development cap is in place. 
4.  For final discretionary approvals occurring in years that a residential development cap is in place, a condition shall be imposed on the final discretionary approval that a residential building permit shall not be approved unless adequate allotments exist under the residential development cap to allow the filing of the residential building permit application subject to Section 17.19.060 of this chapter. 
B.  Dwelling units that are to be phased per an approved development agreement shall be considered in calculations required by Section 17.19.050 of this chapter in accordance with the phasing terms of the development agreement. Development agreements are encouraged. 
C.  The goal of an average annual growth rate of one percent is based on the State Department of Finance's estimated 1999 population of forty one thousand and the buildout estimate of fifty thousand four hundred (Note: The persons per household is calculated as follows: 50,400 pop.41,000 pop. = 9,400 pop./20 years = 470 pop. per year/225 units per year equals 2.08 persons per household.). 
D.  Since the buildout estimates do not include on-campus Sonoma State University (SSU) units and the city does not have control over development by the state, existing and new SSU units shall not be used in the calculations required by Section 17.19.050 of this chapter should SSU be annexed to the city. 
E.  Estimated 1999 population includes population within the Canon Manor area. Therefore, residential units in Canon Manor existing on the effective date of this chapter shall not be included in the calculations required by Section 17.19.050 of this chapter should Canon Manor be annexed to the city. Further, where future development is anticipated to replace residential units existing within the proposed specific plan areas on the date of annexation, those units shall not be included in the calculations required by Section 17.19.050 of this chapter should the areas be annexed to the city. 
F.  Other housing units exempt from the trigger cap calculation: 
1.  Low and very-low income housing, and housing that is affordable to moderate-income households under the city's inclusionary housing requirements; 
2.  Replacement housing on single-family lots and new housing on lots in subdivisions within the existing city limits at the time of adoption of this chapter for which the final map was recorded prior to adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter; 
3.  Second dwelling units; 
4.  Model homes, as defined by subsection 17.19.020(C) of this chapter, until such time as a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
5.  Residential infill projects or portions thereof that are: 
(a)  Listed in the quantified objectives of the city's housing element; 
(b)  Adaptive reuse projects (i.e. the redevelopment of an existing property from a non-residential use to a residential use); 
(c)  Transit oriented development; 
(d)  Live/Work projects; 
(e)  Residential projects developed on commercial properties that have mixed-use components or are under five acres in size or one hundred units or less; 
(f)  Smaller residential projects (e.g., under five acres in size or one hundred units); or 
(g)  Special Needs units (e.g., single-family units designed for disabled residents). 
G.  Congregate care/assisted-living facilities shall be considered an institutional use and the beds shall not be included in the calculations required by Section 17.19.050 of this chapter. Independent living units for seniors (i.e., those that contain individual kitchens) shall be included in the Section 17.19.050 calculations; however, every two and one-half units shall be counted as one unit. 
H.  The average household size and estimated population and unit growth shall be reviewed based on Census 2000 and following any future U.S. Census or special census. Changes may be made as necessary to accommodate the data provided in Census 2000 and any future census. 
I.  The calendar year 2001 is the beginning of the growth management program. 
J.  To account for no growth outside of the city's 2000 city limits for the first several years after the effective date of this chapter, growth within the first four years shall be limited to nine hundred housing units, an average of two hundred twenty-five units per year. The review of the development pace for the preceding three-year period begins in the fifth year by looking at years two, three, and four. 
(Ord. 755 § 4, 2006; Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.19.050 - Formula for applying trigger cap. 
A.  Beginning in the calendar year 2005, if the annual report demonstrates both that the combined number of residential building permits implemented in any two successive (i.e., prior) calendar years exceeds five hundred sixty housing units (five hundred sixty represents one hundred twenty-five percent of the two-year average growth of four hundred fifty housing units), and the development pace for the preceding three-year period has exceeded an average of two hundred twenty-five units per year, then a cap on residential development (i.e., residential units) in the following calendar year shall be established. The residential development cap, if triggered, shall be based on the following formula: (Number of years beginning in Year 2001 x 225 units) less the number of units included in residential building permits implemented equals the residential development cap. The following examples are based on potential market driven development scenarios. 
Scenarios 	I 	II 	III 	IV

* 	A 16 unit apartment complex has already been approved this year. 
** 	City hopes to approve housing in the City Center and possibly along Commerce Blvd. in Year one or two. 
*** 	Trigger Criteria (both criteria must be met to trigger cap): 
1=development approvals exceed 560 in any two successive (i.e., prior) years. 
2=development pace over the preceding 3-year period has exceeded an average of 225 units per year (675). 
**** 	When the cap is triggered, the cap is set by calculating the number of years (past years + trigger year) times 225 units per year and subtracting the number of units that have been approved to date (e.g., Scenario 1, Year 5 = 5 X 225 =1,125; 1,125846 = 279). 
 
B.  During the annual review, the trigger cap may be adjusted up or down a maximum of ten percent by the city council (i.e., between two hundred two and two hundred forty seven) to accommodate changes in land use program assumptions (for example, vacancy rate factors and household size). 
(Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.19.060 - Establishing priority development areas and application of residential development cap. 
A.  Establishing Priority Development Areas. The city council may, by resolution, establish priority development areas, after calculating the trigger cap and determining the need for a residential development cap based on policies in the land use and growth management element of the general plan. 
B.  Residential Development Cap. If established, the residential development cap shall be allocated at the time of residential building permit application except as provided for in subsection 17.19.040(A)(3). Examination of an application for allotment under the residential development cap shall consider the following factors, with the first four factors to be given the highest priority: 
1.  Project Design. The extent to which the project is adapted to its natural setting, promotes mixed use and pedestrian-oriented development and otherwise fosters smart growth principles, contributes to a cityscape that provides visual interest, and results in a development with a distinctive character. Emphasizes linkages and accessibility to existing and proposed public and private open space, bicycle/pedestrian paths, commercial centers, and transit opportunities. 
2.  Maintenance of City Services and Facilities (including, but not limited to, wastewater, stormwater drainage, water supply, parks, and roadways). The extent to which the project provides for a funding mechanism to ensure continued provision of city services without creating a burden on existing residents, including the provision and funding of required public safety facilities and the ongoing provision of public safety services. 
3.  Sustainability/Green Building. The extent to which the development incorporates green building techniques and standards, maximizes energy efficiency, minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, and provides for the use of reclaimed water and the reduction of water consumption and discharge. 
4.  Affordable Housing. The extent to which the development accommodates the city's regional fair share housing allocations as described in the housing element of the general plan, particularly for very low- and low-income households and for preferred types of affordable housing (e.g., are "for sale" units needed more than "rental" units during a given time period, or are second units desired to meet a portion of the existing affordable housing need?) 
5.  Art and Cultural Components. The extent to which the development contributes and funds aesthetic benefits for the community, both on- and off-site. 
6.  Traffic Improvements. The extent to which the developer provides priority local and regional roadway improvements. 
7.  Development Agreement. The extent to which the project has an approved development agreement with the city. 
In the event that more than one application for final discretionary approval is submitted that has equal merit based on the above criteria, the residential cap shall be allocated on a calendar year basis on a first-come, first-served basis. 
In the case of a residential development cap of seventy-five or more, the city shall not approve final discretionary permits for more than one-third of the cap to any single applicant or single residential development unless the city council finds that such approval is consistent with the resolution adopted pursuant to subsection (A) of this section. For purposes of this section, a single residential development means one or more contiguous units on contiguous lands owned by any person, persons, legal entity or entities or any combination thereof which have a common ownership interest of more than fifty percent in each such entity. 
(Ord. 755 § 5, 2006; Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.19.070 - City standards. 
The city council shall adopt general performance standards for streets, water, wastewater, storm water, solid waste, parks, and public safety. Specific performance standards for citywide facilities shall be adopted as part of the capital improvement program (CIP). 
(Ord. 711 § 2 (part), 2004: Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)

A.  A legal description of the affected property, a listing of property owners, and the proposed parties to the agreement; 
B.  A description of the development project, indicating the permitted uses of the property, floor-area ratio or density, building height and size, phasing of development, provisions for the reservation and dedication of land for public purposes and such additional information as may be required to allow the applicable criterion and factors to be applied to the proposal. Such information may include, but is not limited to, site and building plans, elevations, relationships to adjacent properties, and operational data. Where appropriate, the description may distinguish between elements of the project that are proposed to be fixed under the agreement and those that may vary; 
C.  An identification of any planned unit development permit or other special zoning approval that has already been obtained for the development project; 
D.  The special conditions, if any, to be imposed; 
E.  The timing of the development project; 
F.  Public facilities financing plan; 
G.  A statement of the relationship to the specific plan and to the general plan; and 
H.  Other items specific to the project proposal, as determined by the city attorney or planning and community development director. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.21.030 - Procedure. 
A.  An application for a development agreement shall be considered by the planning commission, which shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be given as provided in Sections 65090 and 65091 of the California Government Code in addition to any other notice required by law for other actions to be considered concurrently with the development agreement. The planning commission shall determine whether the proposal is consistent with the city's general plan and any applicable specific plan, and may recommend approval or disapproval of the application, or recommend its approval subject to changes in the development agreement or conditions of approval, giving consideration to the factors set forth in Section 17.21.040. 
B.  After a recommendation has been rendered by the planning commission, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the hearing and the intention to consider adoption of a development agreement shall be given as provided in Sections 65090 and 65091 of the California Government Code in addition to any other notice required by law for other actions to be considered concurrently with the development agreement. The council shall review the recommendation of the commission and determine whether the proposal is consistent with the city's general plan and any applicable specific plan, and may approve or disapprove the proposed development agreement, or approve it subject to changes therein or conditions of approval, giving consideration to the factors set forth in Section 17.21.040. If the council approves the development agreement or approves it subject to changes or conditions, it shall do so by ordinance. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.21.040 - Factors for consideration. 
In reviewing an application for a development agreement, the planning commission and city council shall give consideration to other pending applications and approved projects; the traffic, parking, public service, visual, and other impacts of the proposed development project upon abutting properties and the surrounding area; ability of the applicant to fulfill public facilities financing plan obligations; the relationship of the project to the city's growth management program; the provisions included, if any, for reservation, dedication, or improvement of land for public purposes or accessible to the public; the type and magnitude of the project's economic effects to the city of Rohnert Park, and of its contribution if any toward meeting the city's housing needs; and to any other comparable, relevant factor. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.21.050 - Periodic reviews. 
A.  Periodic review. Each development agreement shall be reviewed at least once every twelve months, and the review period shall be specified in the agreement. Application for periodic review shall be made on a form prescribed by the planning and community development director and shall be filed with such department. A fee prescribed by the city council shall accompany the application. Failure to file for such review within thirty days of a written notice sent by the planning and community development director of the requirement to file within the time limits specified in the agreement shall render the agreement null and void. The applicant or successor in interest shall be required to demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement. If the planning and community development director finds that such compliance has been deficient, he or she shall forward this finding and his or her recommendation to the city council for consideration in accordance with subsection B of this section. 
B.  Termination. At any time the city council may, at a public hearing, consider whether there are grounds for termination of any development agreement. Notice of the hearing shall be given by posting notices thereof within three hundred feet of the property involved. Notice of the hearing shall also be given by mail or delivery to the holder of the development agreement, to all parties who have commented on the initial application, and to other interested parties as deemed appropriate. All such notices shall be given not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing. At the hearing, the applicant or successor in interest shall be required to demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement. If as a result of such review, the council finds and determines, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the applicant or successor thereto has not complied in good faith with the terms or conditions of the agreement, the council may terminate or modify the agreement in whole or in part. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.21.060 - Adherence to development agreement, and amendment or cancellation by mutual consent. 
A development agreement shall not be transferred or assigned to a new person without the written consent of the city. A successor in interest shall provide proof of ability to fulfill the applicant's obligations pursuant to the development agreement. In any case, the burdens of such agreement shall also bind, and its benefits shall also inure to, all successors in interest. A development agreement may be amended, or canceled in whole or in part, by the mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or their successors in interest. Such amendments and cancellations shall be processed in the same manner as an original application and shall be subject to the same procedural requirements. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.21.070 - Recording. 
No later than ten calendar days after the city enters into a development agreement, the city clerk shall record with the county recorder a copy of the agreement, which shall describe the land subject thereto. If the agreement is amended, canceled, or revoked pursuant to Sections 17.21.070 and 17.21.080, the city clerk shall record notice of such action with the recorder. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
Chapter 17.23 - MOBILE HOME PARK CONVERSIONS 
 
17.23.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that any proposed conversion of an existing mobile home park to any other use is preceded by adequate notice, that the social and fiscal impacts of the proposed conversion are adequately defined prior to consideration of a proposed conversion and that relocation and other assistance is provided park residents, consistent with the provisions of this chapter and Sections 65863.7 and 66427.4 of the California Government Code. Conversions of mobile home parks may conflict with the policies of the city of Rohnert Park to provide a variety of tenure, type, price, and location of housing and to maintain the supply of mobile home housing for low- and moderate-income persons and families. This chapter is enacted to ensure that approval of proposed conversions and cessation of use is consistent with policies and objectives of the city of Rohnert Park, particularly the following: 
A.  To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community; 
B.  To provide a reasonable balance between mobile homes and other types of housing; 
C.  To inform prospective participants in a conversion project regarding the physical conditions of the structures and land offered for purchase; 
D.  To reduce and avoid the displacement of long-term residents, particularly senior citizens, the handicapped, low-income households, and families with school-age children who may be required to move from the community due to a shortage of replacement mobile home housing or other affordable housing alternatives. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.23.015 - Interpretation. 
A.  A variety of State of California laws address subjects relating to mobile homes, mobile home parks, the valuation of mobile homes, and the purchase of mobile home parks by non-profit resident organizations. In adopting this chapter, the city council recognizes that these lawsfor example, the Mobile Home Parks Act (Part 2.1 of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code); the Subdivision Map Act (Part of Division 2 of the Government Code); the Subdivided Lands Act (Part 2 of Division 4 of the Business and Professions Code)preempt local legislation on the subject matter areas addressed by these state laws. Nothing in this chapter shall, in any way, be construed, interpreted or implemented in a way that conflicts with state law. 
B.  The Constitutions of the State of California and the United States provide the owner of private property with certain procedural and substantive rights of due process. It is the intention of the city council in adopting this chapter to respect, to the fullest extent of the law, those procedural and substantive rights of due process. Nothing in this chapter shall, in any, be construed, interpreted or implemented in a way that deprives a private property owner of procedural and substantive due process under the Constitutions of the State of California and the United States. 
(Ord. 695 § 3, 2003)  
17.23.020 - Definitions. 
For the purpose of this chapter, certain words and phrases are defined in this part and shall be construed as herein set forth unless it shall be apparent from their context that a different meaning is intended. 
"Comparable housing" means housing that is comparable in floor area and number of bedrooms to the mobile home to which comparison is being made, which housing meets the minimum standards of the State Uniform Housing Code. 
"Comparable mobile home park" means any other mobile home park substantially equivalent in terms of park conditions, amenities and other relevant factors. 
"Conversion project" means changing the use of a mobile home park for a purpose other than the rental, or the holding out for rent, of two or more mobile home sites to accommodate mobile homes used for human habitation. A conversion shall include, but not be limited to, a change of any existing mobile home park or any portion thereof to condominium, stock cooperative, planned unit development, or any form of ownership wherein spaces within the mobile home park are to be sold, or the cessation of use of all or a portion of the park as a mobile home park, whether immediately or on a gradual basis, or the closure of a park. "Conversion" shall not include the purchase of the park by its existing residents. 
"Property owner" means the owner or subdivider with a controlling proprietary interest in the proposed mobile home park conversion project. 
"Designated resident organization" means any association of mobile home owners and/or mobile home residents within a mobile home park which has, not later than fifteen days after issuance of a notice of intent to convert, provided the owner or manager of the mobile home park written notice of the following:

6.  If the city council determines that a particular mobile home cannot be relocated to a comparable mobile home park within the city of Rohnert Park or Sonoma County (and no other identified location is acceptable to the homeowner) and the mobile home owner has elected to sell his or her mobile home, than the city council may, as a part of the reasonable cost of relocation as provided in Government Code Section 65863.7(e) require the applicant to provide for purchasing the mobile home of a displaced home owner. Such value shall be determined after consideration of relevant factors, including the value of the mobile home in its current location including the blocks, skirting, siding, porches, decks, awnings, storage sheds, cabanas, and earthquake bracing, and assuming the continuation of the mobile home park in a safe, sanitary, and well maintained condition, and not considering the effect of the change of use on the value of the mobile home.

The appraisals are to be made no more than sixty days prior to their submittal. The city council shall determine the value based on the average of the appraisals submitted by the applicant and the mobile home owner. 
7.  Additional measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of conversion upon mobile home park residents and homeowners may be included in the relocation and purchase assistance plan. These measures may include but not be limited to: 
a.  For those who move to a multiple or a two-family dwelling, provision of a rent subsidy for up to twenty-four months. Rent shall not exceed the fair market rent for equivalent housing in Sonoma County as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 876, § 3(Exh. A), adopted Apr. 8, 2014, repealed the former Ch. 17.27, §§ 17.27.01017.27.100, and enacted a new Ch. 17.27 as set out herein. The former Ch. 17.27 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 765 § 2 (part), 2006. 
 
17.27.010 - Purpose. 
The purposes of these sign standards and regulations include: 
A.  Protect the public safety and welfare by avoiding hazardous distractions or conditions to pedestrian and vehicle traffic through careful placement, orientation, design and maintenance of signage. 
B.  Ensure that signage is clearly stated, appropriately scaled, and in harmony with the character and appearance of the building or use that is being identified. 
C.  Maintain and enhance the city's appearance by regulating the design, character, location, number, type, quality of materials, size, illumination and maintenance of signs. 
D.  Protect residential districts and adjoining nonresidential districts from adverse impacts of excessive numbers or sizes of nearby signs. 
E.  Generally limit commercial signage to on-site locations in order to protect the aesthetic environment from the visual clutter associated with the unrestricted proliferation of signs, while providing channels of communication to the public. 
F.  Limit the number and size of signs to levels that reasonably allow for the identification of institutional or commercial locations and the nature of the use, business or services provided at such location. 
G.  Regulate the number and sizes of signs according to standards consistent with the types of establishments in each zoning district or in different portions of a zoning district. 
H.  Avoid unnecessary and time consuming approval requirements for certain minor or temporary signs that do not require review for compliance with the city's building and electrical codes while limiting the size and number of such signs so as to minimize visual clutter. 
I.  Respect and protect the right of free speech by sign display, while reasonably regulating the structural locational and other aspects of signs not related to communication, generally for the public health, safety, welfare and specifically to serve the public interests in community aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety. 
J.  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign standards and regulations. 
K.  Regulate signs in a constitutional manner, which is content neutral as to noncommercial signs and viewpoint neutral as to commercial signs. All administrative interpretations and discretion is to be exercised in light of this policy and consistent with the purposes stated in this section. 
(Ord. No. 876, § 3(Exh. B), 4-8-2014)  
17.27.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Regulation. This chapter regulates signs located on private property within all zoning district of the city. This chapter also applies to signs within public rights-of-way, and to property owned by public agencies other than the city and over which the city has zoning and land use regulatory power. Except where otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, all signs located in such areas of the city must be erected and maintained in conformity with this chapter. 
B.  Definitions. Definitions of the specialized terms and phrases used in this chapter are contained in Chapter 17.04 (Definitions) of this Municipal Code. References to "department" means the department of development services, and references to "director" means the development services director or the director's designee. 
(Ord. No. 876, § 3(Exh. B), 4-8-2014)  
17.27.030 - General provisions. 
A.  Sign Permit Required. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to place, erect, structurally or electrically alter, change commercial message copy (except for changeable copy signs), move, or display any temporary or permanent sign without first obtaining a sign permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. No additional sign permit or approval is required for cleaning or other normal maintenance of a previously approved sign, unless a structural or electrical change is made. 
B.  Owner's Consent Required. The consent of the property owner, designated agent, or person in control or possession of the property is required before any sign may be erected on any private property within the city. 
C.  Noncommercial Signs. Noncommercial signs are allowed wherever commercial signage is permitted and are subject to the same standards and total maximum allowances per site or building of each sign type specified in this chapter. A sign permit or sign program approval is required for a permanent noncommercial sign only when a permanent commercial sign has not been previously approved. For purposes of this chapter, all noncommercial messages are deemed to be "on-site," regardless of location. 
D.  Substitution of Noncommercial Messages. Subject to the consent of the property owner or person in control or possession of the property, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for all or part of the commercial or noncommercial message on any sign allowed under this chapter. No special or additional permit is required to substitute a noncommercial message for any other message on a permitted sign, provided the sign structure is already approved or exempt from the sign permit requirement and no structural or electrical change is made. When a noncommercial message is substituted for any other message, however, the sign is still subject to the same design, locational and structural regulations (e.g., color, materials, size, height, illumination, maintenance, duration of display, etc.) as well as all building and electrical code requirements, as would apply if the sign were used to display a commercial message. In the event of any perceived or actual conflict between the general provisions of this subsection and any other specific provisions in this chapter, the provisions of this subsection will prevail. 
E.  Substitution of Commercial Messages. The substitution of one commercial message for another commercial message is not automatically allowed nor is the free substitution of a commercial message in a place where only a noncommercial message is allowed. In addition, no off-site commercial messages may be substituted for on-site commercial messages. 
F.  Legal Nature of Sign Rights and Duties. All rights, duties and responsibilities related to permanent signs attach to the land on which the sign is erected or displayed and run with the land or personal property. The city may demand compliance with this chapter and with the terms of any sign permit from the sign permit holder, the owner of the sign, the property owner or person in control or possession of the property, or the person erecting the sign.

17.27.040 - Sign permit and sign program requirements. 
A.  General. Unless specifically exempted in Section 17.27.050 (Exempt Signs), a sign permit or sign program approval must be secured for all signs in accordance with this chapter. Granting a permit or approval in accordance with this chapter in no way eliminates the need to otherwise obtain a building or encroachment permit when required.

3.  The director will initially determine whether the application contains all the information and items required by this chapter and may be deemed complete. 
4.  All notices required by this chapter are deemed given upon the date any such notice is either deposited in the United States mail, the date upon which personal service of such notice is provided or the date that the notice is electronically transmitted (if applicable). 
5.  No application will be accepted if: 
a.  The applicant has installed a sign in violation of the provisions of this chapter and, at the time of submission of the application, each illegal sign has not been legalized, removed or included in the application.

2.  Determinations on sign permit applications are to be guided by the standards, criteria and findings set forth in this chapter. 
3.  The director may refer certain sign permit applications to the planning commission for review. Such determination should be made within ten business days of a complete application and acted upon by the planning commission within sixty days or concurrent with any related and required project approval that is presented to the planning commission. The planning commission's approval may be conditional so as to ensure compliance with the purposes and provisions of this chapter. 
4.  An application may be granted either in whole or in part when more than one sign or location is proposed by an applicant. When an application is denied in whole or in part, the determination of the director or planning commission must be in writing and must specify the grounds for such denial. 
F.  Standard Sign Program Review Process. 
1.  After receiving a complete sign program application, the director must schedule consideration of the sign program by the planning commission within sixty days of the complete application or concurrent with any related and required project approval that is presented to the planning commission.

G.  Findings. A sign permit or sign program that is reviewed in compliance with this chapter may be approved only after the following findings and determinations are made by the appropriate review authority: 
1.  That the proposed location of the use is in accordance with the objectives of the zoning ordinance and the purposes of the district in which the sign is located; 
2.  That the proposed location of the sign and the conditions under which the sign would be operated and maintained will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity. 
H.  Approval Period, Expiration and Time Extensions. A sign permit or sign program approval will expire one year from the date of issuance unless the sign or at least one sign in an approved sign program has been installed in accordance with the conditions of approval. If the sign permit or sign program is for a building or shopping center under construction, the one year approval period will commence on the date of issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for the project. 
1.  Prior to expiration of a sign permit or program, the applicant may apply for an extension of up to one additional year. The extension request will be reviewed by the review authority that acted on the original request. 
2.  The permit or approval will be null and void if the zoning ordinance changes significantly prior to the installation of the sign to a point that given the new regulations in the zoning ordinance such a sign would not be permitted. 
I.  Revocation. The initial reviewing authority may revoke any sign permit or sign approval according to the process outlined in Sections 17.25.140 through 17.25.148 upon refusal of the permit or approval holder to comply with the provisions of this chapter after written notice of noncompliance and at least fifteen days' opportunity to cure.

17.27.050 - Exempt signs. 
The following signs are allowed without a sign permit or sign approval provided that they otherwise comply with the city's design guidelines and this chapter. A sign which is considered exempt in accordance with this chapter in no way eliminates the need to otherwise obtain a building or encroachment permit when required.

The owner or user may maintain the sign at the premises and at a location necessary for continued public visibility at the height or size at which the sign was previously lawfully erected pursuant to all applicable codes, regulations and permits. Any such sign will be deemed to be in conformance with this chapter.
