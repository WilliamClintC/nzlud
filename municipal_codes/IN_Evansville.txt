2.107.090 Powers and duties.

The commission shall have the following powers and duties:

(A) To adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind such rules and regulations, procedural and substantive, as are consistent with the provisions of this chapter or its intent and purpose as the commission may deem necessary.

(B) To receive and investigate the merits, allegations, and factual basis of complaints of discriminatory practices under this chapter, and to hold hearings on such complaints. All investigations of complaints shall be investigated by the commission or staff members of the commission. Such investigations shall be impartial and shall not be limited in each instance to the discriminatory practices alleged in the complaint. At the end of each investigation, a staff member of the commission shall prepare a final investigative report. The investigative report will contain:

(1) The names and dates of contact with witnesses;

(2) A summary and the dates of correspondence and other contacts with the aggrieved person and the respondent;

(3) A summary description of other records;

(4) A summary of witness statements; and

(5) Answers to interrogatories.

A final investigative report may be amended at any time, if additional evidence is discovered. Following the completion of investigation the commission shall notify the aggrieved person and the respondent that the final investigative report is complete and will be provided upon request. See IC 22-9.5-6-7.

(C) To initiate complaints, except that no member of the commission who initiates a complaint may participate as a member of the commission in the hearing or disposition of the complaint.

(D) To prevent any person from discriminating or retaliating against any other person because he/she filed a complaint with the commission, has testified in any hearing before the commission, or has in any way assisted the commission in any matter under investigation.

(E) To seek prompt judicial action. If the commission concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this article, the commission may file a civil action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint in Circuit or Superior Court in Vanderburgh County. A temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief under this subsection is governed by the Indiana Rules of Trial Procedure.

(F) To hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take the testimony of any such person under oath and require the production for examination of any records, documents, or other evidence relating to any matter under investigation or in question before the commission. The commission shall have the authority to institute actions for appropriate legal or equitable relief in Circuit or Superior Court to obtain enforcement of any commission order or subpoena. All subpoenas and orders emanating from the commission shall be served pursuant to the Indiana Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to service in civil actions.

(G) To appoint hearing officers, other than commissioners, when an appointment is deemed necessary by a majority of the commission. The hearing officers shall be attorneys in good standing before the Indiana bar and shall be appointed by the chairperson of the commission. A hearing officer appointed under this subsection shall have the same powers and duties as a commission member sitting as a hearing officer, except the power to issue subpoenas.

(H) To attempt conciliation between the parties. If such conciliation efforts fail, the commission shall conduct hearings to find facts, reach conclusions, and issue orders.

(1) During the period beginning with the filing of the complaint and ending with the reasonable cause and charge of discrimination, or no reasonable cause determination, the commission will, to the extent feasible, attempt to conciliate the complaint.

(2) In conciliating the complaint, the commission will attempt to achieve a just resolution of the complaint and to obtain assurances that the respondent will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of the aggrieved person, and take such action as will assure the elimination of discriminatory housing practices, or the prevention of their occurrence in the future.

(3) Generally, members of the commission or staff of the commission engaged in the investigation of a complaint will not participate or advise in the conciliation of the same complaint or in any factually related complaint.

Where the rights of the aggrieved party and the respondent can be protected and the prohibitions with respect to disclosure of information can be observed, the investigator of the complaint may suspend fact finding and engage in efforts to resolve the complaint by conciliation.

(4) The terms of a settlement of a complaint will be reduced to a written conciliation agreement. The conciliation agreement shall seek to protect the interests of the aggrieved person, other persons similarly situated, and the public interest. The types of relief that may be sought are:

(a) For the aggrieved person:

(i) Monetary relief in the form of damages, including damages caused by humiliation or embarrassment, and attorneys’ fees;

(ii) Other equitable relief including, but not limited to, access to the dwelling at issue, or to a comparable dwelling, the provision of services or facilities in connection with a dwelling, or other specific relief; or

(iii) Injunctive relief appropriate to the elimination of discriminatory housing practices affecting the aggrieved person or other persons.

(iv) The conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration of the dispute arising from the complaint. Arbitration may award appropriate relief as described in this subsection. The aggrieved person and the respondent may, in the conciliation agreement, limit the types of relief that may be awarded under binding arbitration.

(b) For the public interest:

(i) Elimination of discriminatory housing practices.

(ii) Prevention of future discriminatory housing practices.

(iii) Remedial affirmative activities to overcome discriminatory housing practices.

(5) The agreement must be executed by the respondent and the complainant. The agreement is subject to approval by the commission. The commission will indicate its approval by having a majority of the commission members sign the agreement. The commission will approve an agreement and, if the commission is the complainant, will execute the agreement, only if:

(a) The complainant and the respondent agree to the relief accorded to the aggrieved person;

(b) The provisions of the agreement will adequately vindicate the public interest; and

(c) If the commission is the complainant, all aggrieved persons named in the complaint are satisfied with the relief provided to protect their interests.

(6) The commission may issue a reasonable cause determination if the aggrieved person and the respondent have executed a conciliation agreement that has not been approved by the commission.

(7) The commission may terminate its efforts to conciliate the complaint if the respondent fails or refuses to confer with the commission; the aggrieved person or the respondent fail to make a good faith effort to resolve any dispute; or the commission finds, for any reason, that voluntary agreement is not likely to result.

(8) Where the aggrieved person has commenced a civil action under Federal or State law seeking relief with respect to the alleged discriminatory housing practice, and the trial in the action has commenced, the commission will terminate conciliation unless the court specifically requests assistance from the commission.

(9) Nothing that is said or done in the course of conciliation may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent administrative hearing under this chapter or in civil actions under the Federal Fair Housing Act or the Indiana Fair Housing Act without the written consent of the persons concerned.

(10) Conciliation agreements shall be made public unless the aggrieved person and respondent request nondisclosure and the commission determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this chapter.

Notwithstanding a determination that disclosure of a conciliation agreement is not required, the commission may publish tabulated descriptions of the results of all conciliation efforts. See IC 22-9.5-6-5.

(11) The commission may, from time to time, review compliance with the terms of any conciliation agreement. Whenever the commission has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the commission may file a civil action for the enforcement of the terms of the conciliation agreement.

(I) To state findings of fact and conclusions of law after a hearing. If the Commission determines, after a hearing, that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice in violation of this section, the Commission may order the appropriate relief, including actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, and other injunctive or equitable relief. The Commission, in an administrative hearing under Indiana Code 22-9.5-6-14, may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs against the respondent. See IC 22-9.5-9-1. To vindicate the public interest, the Commission may assess a civil penalty against the respondent in an amount that does not exceed the following:

(1) Sixteen thousand dollars if the respondent has not been adjudged by order of the Commission or a court to have committed a prior discriminatory housing practice.

(2) Except as provided by subsection (J) of this section, $37,500 if the respondent has been adjudged by order of the Commission or a court to have committed one other discriminatory housing practice during the five-year period ending on the date of the filing of the finding of reasonable cause.

(3) Except as provided by subsection (J) of this section, $65,000 if the respondent has been adjudged by order of the Commission or a court to have committed two or more discriminatory housing practices during the seven-year period ending on the date of the filing of the finding of reasonable cause.

(J) If the acts constituting the discriminatory housing practice that is the object of the finding of reasonable cause are committed by the same individual who has been previously adjudged to have committed acts constituting a discriminatory housing practice, the civil penalties in subsections (I)(2) and (3) of this section may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which any other discriminatory housing practice occurred. The commission may sue to recover a civil penalty due under this section. See IC 22-9.5-6-15(b).

(K) If after the hearing the commission shall find that the respondent has not engaged in any practice or is not about to engage in any practice in violation of this chapter, the commission shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. The commission shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.

(L) Judicial review of commission orders shall be obtained in accordance with the provisions of IC 4-21.5-5.

(M) The commission shall prepare and submit to the Mayor, Evansville City Council, Vanderburgh County Council and the commission members once each year a detailed report of the commission’s activities, including the investigations, conciliations, and hearings it has conducted and their outcome.

(3) A “warning” level travel advisory may be issued only after a local disaster emergency is declared under IC 10-14-3-29. [Ord. G-2016-15 § 1, passed 3-30-16; Ord. G-2010-5 § 5, passed 3-16-10; Ord. G-2001-15 § 1, passed 7-6-01. 1983 Code § 16.02.11.]

(A) The purpose of this section is to enable all departments in the City and the County to use the same addressing standards for all official documents created and maintained by City and County government offices, agencies and departments. This database is not designed for the purpose of locating property owners or establishing mailing addresses, it is for the sole purpose of assigning an address and geographic location for every parcel, and eventually every building, located within the boundary of Vanderburgh County.

(B) Addresses shall only be assigned to parcels by the Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission and the City Engineer. All addresses will be placed in a geographic information system (GIS) data layer to be used for quality assessment/quality control (QA/QC) for all other uses. Updates and changes to the data layer will only be accessible by ITAC-approved technicians with oversight from the Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission staff. All fields, except “Notes,” in the master address database may only be modified with the final approval of the Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission. Parcel address data layer will be viewable by all departments and the public.

Address elements are grouped as follows:

(1) Address number.

(2) Directional prefix.

(3) Street-type prefix.

(4) Street name.

(5) Street-type suffix.

(6) Directional suffix.

(7) Building, floor or unit.

(8) XY coordinates.

Only the City Engineer, for and within the boundaries of the City of Evansville, and Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission, for and outside of the boundaries of Vanderburgh County, shall assign addresses. All address corrections must be approved by the City Engineer or Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission. The master records will use all capital letters with no punctuation.

(C) Address Elements.

(1) Address Number. The address number will be a whole integer in most cases. If a lot is divided and there is no number available to address the two new individual lots with a whole integer, they may be designated as follows:

Lot one would keep the original address number and lot two would be designated as the original address number and one-half. For example: A lot has an address of 1 Main Street and the lot next to it is addressed 3 Main Street. If 1 Main Street was divided into two lots, the first lot would be 1 Main Street and the lot between 1 Main Street and 3 Main Street would be addressed 1-1/2 Main Street.

The lowest possible digit for an address is 1. The address numbers will be expressed as numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0) rather than written words. A range of addresses will be expressed as (lowest number) – (highest number) or (lowest number) through (highest number), for example 18 – 20. For “Rear of” or other descriptors see subsection (C)(7) of this section, Building, Floor or Unit.

(4) Street Name. All street names will use the spelling as it appears in the official list of street names produced by the Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission. This list is compiled from the recorded plats, which contains the recorded street names. Street names will not be abbreviated on any official City or County government documents and those with a number used as a street name will be written in alpha characters such as “First” and not “1st.” Directional words “north,” “south,” “east,” and “west” as part of the street name should never be abbreviated so that they will not be confused with directional prefixes or suffixes. All letters in all addresses will be capitalized.

(5) Street-Type Suffix. Every address shall have a street-type suffix. The current list of accepted street-type suffixes are as follows:

If these words or the abbreviations for these words appear as the last word in an address, they will be considered the street type and not part of the street name.

(6) Directional Suffix. The accepted directional suffixes and the abbreviation to be used for these directional suffixes are as follows:

	NORTH – N	NORTHEAST – NE

	SOUTH – S	NORTHWEST – NW

	EAST – E	SOUTHEAST – SE

	WEST – W	SOUTHWEST – SW

Directional suffixes shall always be abbreviated as above.

(7) Building, Floor, or Unit. Additional identifying information such as apartment, building, floor, suite, unit, room, rear of, department or other descriptors may be used as part of the address but shall follow the street-type and directional suffix (if applicable) and be separated by a space. The most common designators and their corresponding abbreviations are as follows:

	SUFFIX	ABBR

	APARTMENT	APT

	BUILDING	BLDG

	DEPARTMENT	DEPT

	FLOOR	FL

	LOT	LOT

	REAR OF	 

	ROOM	RM

(8) XY Coordinates. A point on each lot (or each building on each lot if possible) will be placed to geographically connect addresses to correct location. This will permit a more accurate location for addresses.

(9) Aliases – Common Alternate Names. The next columns on the address data layer will be reserved for aliases. These are common names of streets, etc., that may not comply with the official master address street name or modifier. This list will contain any and all known nicknames, abbreviations, etc., and will be searchable for names not found in the master list.

(10) Vacant Ground or Having Building. This “either/or” column will indicate if a structure(s) is located on the property or the land is vacant. V = Vacant, B = Building. This is not intended to be used for determining type of building or use of property.

(11) Parcel ID Number – Temporary. There are three relevant parcel ID numbers as the intent of this addressing standard is to have an address assigned to every parcel. The temporary parcel ID number is assigned by the Evansville-Vanderburgh Area Plan Commission upon recording of a parcel configuration change (subdivision, split, join, etc.).

(12) Parcel ID Number – Local. There are three relevant parcel ID numbers as the intent of this addressing standard is to have an address assigned to every parcel. When a permanent local parcel ID is assigned by the appropriate assessor’s office, it will take the place of the temporary parcel ID number.

(13) Parcel ID Number – State. There are three relevant parcel ID numbers as the intent of this addressing standard is to have an address assigned to every parcel. The State parcel ID number will be assigned by the appropriate assessor’s office at their respective convenience.

(14) Anomaly or Standard Address. Addresses that are out of order geographically or not in compliance with address standards contained herein will have an indicator shown in this column. Information concerning the reason for the anomaly will be contained in the notes column.

(15) Notes. Helpful additional information may be contained in the notes column. This nonsearchable field is for sharing of information that might be useful to agencies and/or the public concerning unique features or the causes of anomalies as described above.

(16) U.S. Postal Service Guidelines for Mail Delivery. USPS suggested guidelines (not required by this chapter):

2.170.080 Probationary appointment.

(A) All firefighters appointed from the eligibility list by the commission shall serve a probationary period of 12 months.

The Chief must certify, at least 10 days prior to the completion of the 12-month probationary period, whether the services of the probationary firefighter have been satisfactory and whether the probationary firefighter should receive the status of the rank of firefighter, which decision shall be made by the commission.

(D) At any time during the probationary period, the commission may remove a probationary firefighter whose performance does not meet the required work standards. The Fire Chief shall notify the probationary firefighter of the reasons for such action. [Ord. G-2006-7, passed 4-4-06; Ord. G-2000-14 § 3, 2000, passed 7-11-00; Ord. G-88-18, passed 7-25-88; Ord. G-87-27, passed 10-19-87. 1982 Code § 30.607; 1983 Code § 3.30.607.]


2.170.090 Promotions.

(A) The commission shall have promotion eligibility lists for all ranks, as provided in the table of organization for ranks above firefighter and below Division Chief, said table of organization being established by the Safety Board subject to funding by City Council.

(B) Except as provided in subsection (A) of this section, appointment to the ranks higher than the rank of firefighter shall be made from members according to merit and fitness, to be ascertained from competitive examinations designed to evaluate the member’s relative qualifications and abilities in a manner that complies with existing professional standards and legal guidelines.

(C) The commission shall give notice of each promotional process at least two weeks in advance of the last date for filing applications by posting a notice thereof on a bulletin board maintained in or near the office of the Fire Chief and at each hose house maintained by the department. This official announcement shall state the rank for which the examination is being held, the last date and manner of making application for admission to the examination, all reading material that the written examination will be based upon, and any other information which the commission desires to promulgate. All reading material must be readily available in hard copy form to all applicants.

(D) All members who want to apply for the promotional examination must file a written application on the forms prescribed by the commission within the time fixed by the commission.

(E) The commission shall designate the lower rank or ranks from which promotion can be made and any other qualifications required.

(F) If an application for promotion is rejected, written notice of such rejection and the reason therefor shall be given to the applicant. Any applicant for promotion shall have the right to be heard by the commission to complain of the rejection. If the commission shall find that the rejection was improper, it shall allow the applicant to participate in the examination process.

(G)(1) The first day of the written test shall be the date used to determine bonus points for the examination process.

(2) The expiration or exhaustion date of the then-existing list shall be used to determine seniority points for the examination process.

(3) When a promotional list exhausts before its expiration date, seniority and bonus points will be calculated from the date of exhaustion.

(H) Except as otherwise provided for the appointment of the Chief, Assistant Chief and Division Chief(s), all promotions to ranks higher than the rank of firefighter shall be made in accordance with the relative merit and fitness of the member competing for promotion. Merit and fitness shall be ascertained by competitive examination under the direction of the commission. All examinations and examination parts shall be fair, impartial, and developed in accordance with professional standards and legal guidelines developed by an accredited university, college, or a professional testing company, and shall relate to those matters which will test fairly the relative capacities and fitness of the members to discharge efficiently the duties of the rank to be filled.

(I) In order to be eligible for promotion, a member must meet the following requirements:

	To test for:	A member must have by the time the list goes into effect:

	Lieutenant	2 years on the department

	Captain	2 years in rank as a Lieutenant

	Inspector	5 years on the department

	Instructor	10 years on the department

	District Chief	10 years on the department and a combined total of 2 years in rank as either a Captain, Inspector, or Instructor

If no member passes or applies for the written examination for a rank, a retest will be required and those eligible for the next lower rank will also become eligible to test for this position provided the years-on-the-department requirement is met. A member holding a nontemporary rank may not test for the rank the firefighter currently holds.

(J) The competitive examination process for promotions shall consist of the following:

(1) A written test(s);

(2) Such other relevant assessment methods as may be adopted by the commission but consistent with professional standards and legal guidelines; and

(3) An oral interview or its equivalent will be given for all promotional processes.

The commission may adopt and approve educational training courses and classes for which a member may earn additional credit points for the promotional examination process. These courses and classes will be subject to the approval of the Chief Instructor and Chief of the Evansville Fire Department.

The commission, before each promotional examination process, shall announce the components of the examination process and the minimum credit points attainable for each part thereof.

The commission, in its complete discretion, may establish a system for promotion based in part on a psychological evaluation test; an approved educational program, including, but not limited to, relevant educational classes and/or degrees; and such other relevant assessment methods as the commission may desire.

The commission shall have discretion to determine, fix, change, or alter the credit points to be awarded for each component part of the promotional testing process within reasonable guidelines as established by the commission; provided, however, the commission shall not change the credit points between the dates of the announcement of the giving of a promotional examination and the date the eligibility list is determined for the same. In addition, the commission shall not change or alter the credit points to be awarded for any written test or for seniority.

(K) The identity of every member taking part in the promotional examination process shall be concealed from the commission by use of a numbered identification system. The identity of a competing member shall not be revealed until all of the components of the testing process have been graded and scored in accordance with the rules and regulations of the commission. Any member whose written test papers carry the member’s name or any other identifying mark, or any member who reveals the member’s identification number to the commission, to any member of the department or to any person conducting the testing process, shall be disqualified and so notified.

(L) Appropriate scientific techniques, developed in accordance with professional standards, shall be used in rating the results of all examination parts in determining the relative rating of the competitors.

(M) In order to have the member’s name appear on an eligibility list for a higher rank, such member must participate in each component part of the examination process required by the commission. A member must pass each part of the written examination process. Each member who fails to attain the minimum passing score on the written examination process shall be considered to have failed the examination process. Upon completion of all component parts of the examination process, the commission shall determine the total credit points of each candidate and from such total scores shall establish the eligibility list for the rank tested for. Members on the eligibility list shall be listed in a descending order in accordance with their scores. After July 26, 1996, the commission may require members to attend or participate in educational programs or classes in order to test for a promotional rank so long as the commission announces the requirements at least two years in advance of the commencement of the testing process. The department shall reasonably accommodate members’ departmental work schedule to allow members to attend such programs and classes.

(N) The minimum passing score on the written examination shall be a score of 70 percent. A formal structured interview, if given at the discretion of the commission, shall be scored as follows: The percentage score awarded to the candidate by the interview panel shall be divided by 10 to achieve the awarded points to the candidate for this phase of the testing process. All formal structured oral interviews shall be recorded by a tape recorder, videotape or stenographically.

Examples:

	A Score Of	Is Awarded As

	90%	9.00 points

	85%	8.50 points

	72.22%	7.22 points

	72.25%	7.23 points

	65%	6.50 points

(O) The commission shall determine the credit points to be assigned to each component part of the examination process, which shall be specified in the official announcement of the examination.

(P)(1) Each member who receives a passing grade on all parts of a promotion examination shall have a credit for continuous service as a member of the department added to his grade, computed as follows: three-fourths point shall be added for each of the years of service as a member of the department (maximum of 15 points). Firefighters will be given partial credit for service years depending upon the number of days of service. Points will be calculated by dividing the number of partial service days by 365 and multiplying this figure by three-fourths. This number will be carried out to two decimal points.

(2) Service credit points will be computed as of the date of the examination, as set forth in the official announcement. There shall be no credit given for partial years of service. Service during a probationary period shall be considered as part of continuing service.

(Q) Before the final examination scores are determined, there shall be deducted from each candidate’s total score the following points: one-half point for each written reprimand issued, and one point for each day of suspension served; provided, however, no deduction of points shall occur if discipline issued was served more than two years before the date the final examination scores are determined by the commission. The commission may impose additional restrictions on promotion as part of the disciplinary process. The order of names of members on the eligibility list shall be determined by the final examination score (i.e., the combined scores from all parts of the examination process in descending order). Final examination scores shall include service credit points. Final examination scores shall be carried out to four decimal places. In case of a tie, seniority shall prevail. Credit points acquired by a member for the acquisition of a commission-approved degree shall permanently remain on such member’s record as countable credit points for any promotional examination.

(R) Each member who competes in any part of an examination shall be given written notice of the results of that part and of the entire examination. The notice shall include the member’s score on each part and, if the member passes, the member’s rank on the eligibility list. Such notice shall be given after the eligibility list is established but, in the discretion of the commission, may be given to all members simultaneously at an earlier date.

(S) The commission shall establish and maintain an active eligibility list for all ranks except for the ranks of Chief, Assistant Chief and Division Chief(s). Each list shall contain the names of those members who passed the examination process. A promotion eligibility list, unless earlier exhausted, shall be in effect for 24 months from the effective date. A promotion eligibility list shall not be extended.

(T) Any member who competes in any written test as part of a promotional examination shall have the right to review a copy of the member’s answer sheet along with a copy of the written test booklet and a copy of the correct answer to each written test question. This review shall be held as soon as is practical after the written test administration date, but in any case, within 10 days after the written test has been administered. This review shall be held under the direct supervision of the commission, under appropriate secure conditions. Members will be allowed to present any documentation they desire to the commission, if necessary, supporting any answers to a written test question other than the one specified as being correct by the person giving the test. If the commission deems it just, the commission shall make any necessary corrections to the score and key before recording the final written test scores. Because of the need to use written tests which have been professionally developed and validated in accordance with both professional standards and legal guidelines, members reviewing written test papers shall not take any test material, review material or any written notes from the review room. To the extent practical, reference material used in developing the written test will be made available to members during the review period. A member desiring to appeal the score received on any examination test or other component part shall do so within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the member’s score. An appeal shall be commenced by serving written notice upon the president of the commission detailing the alleged error or errors. The method for calculation of this 10-day period shall be the same as is used in the Indiana Rules of Court.

(U) When a vacancy exists in a rank higher than firefighter and below Division Chief, the Fire Chief shall request from the commission the name of the person eligible for appointment to that rank from the eligibility list. The commission shall appoint the person who holds the top position on the promotion eligibility list for that rank so long as that person continues to meet the requirements herein and under State law.

(V) Temporary Vacancies.

(1) Temporary vacancies in rank and division (i.e., prevention, suppression, and instruction), except for the rank of Lieutenant, including, but not limited to, temporary vacancies due to illness, suspension, vacations, or leaves of absence, if filled, shall be filled on a temporary basis so as to properly staff and manage all apparatus, districts, and shifts.

(a) Until the time a promotion eligibility list is established for a rank, temporary appointments, if required to be made, shall be made based on seniority within the same division; however, State seniority requirements must still be followed.

(b) After the time eligibility lists are established, and if the position is one which needs to be filled, temporary vacancies shall be filled as follows:

(i) Temporary vacancies shall be filled with the firefighter with the highest position on the eligibility list for a promotion to the vacant rank. If there is no such person, then the person with the most seniority in the rank shall be appointed.

(ii) Time served in a temporary position for a firefighter on the eligibility list for a promotion to the vacant rank shall count towards the probationary period for that rank.

(iii) Firefighters on the eligibility list for a promotion to the vacant rank holding a temporary position for 12 months or more shall remain first on the eligibility list for that rank. Said firefighter shall be offered that ranking position once an opening occurs.

(W)(1) A probationary period for promotees shall be regarded as an integral part of the promotional process and shall be utilized for closely observing how well the promotee learns the responsibilities of the higher-level rank and for closely observing the promotee’s work and securing the most effective judgment as to whether or not the promotee’s performance meets required work standards for the higher-level rank. All promotees shall serve a probationary period of 12 months. The immediate supervisor of a promotee shall make monthly reports to the Fire Chief during the officer’s 12-month probationary period as to whether the services of the promotee have been satisfactory and as to whether the promotee should receive a regular appointment to the probationary rank.

(2) The Fire Chief shall make periodic reports during the probationary period to the commission. The Fire Chief must certify, at least 10 days prior to the completion of the 12-month probationary period, whether the services of the promotee have been satisfactory and his recommendation as to whether the promotee shall receive permanent status in that rank. At any time during the probationary period, the commission may remove a promotee whose performance does not meet the required work standards and return the promotee to the promotee’s former rank. The commission shall notify the promotee of the reasons for such action. The decision as to whether a promotee shall receive a regular appointment shall be made by the commission.

(X) After a member is promoted, such promotion shall be contingent upon the member completing 24 hours of approved training per year with such training certified by the Evansville Fire Department Training Division or outside training approved by the Chief.

(Y) A firefighter who resigns his rank but not from the department shall return to the rank of Private until such time as the firefighter’s name comes up for promotion on an eligibility list for a higher rank.

(Z) A firefighter who resigns his/her rank may test for any rank previously held in the next or any subsequent promotion process, provided the firefighter had completed the one-year probationary period for that rank.

2.180.010 Survivors’ benefits of members of the 1925 Police Pension Fund.

(A) Members Dying Other Than in Line of Duty. This subsection (A) shall be interpreted consistent with and in compliance with the requirements of IC 36-8-6-9.6.

(1) This subsection (A) applies to an active or retired member of the 1925 Police Pension Fund who dies other than in the line of duty (as defined in IC 36-8-6-10.1).

(2) A payment shall be made to the surviving spouse of a deceased member in an amount fixed by ordinance, but at least an amount equal to the following:

(a) To the surviving spouse of a member who died before January 1, 1989, an amount equal to 30 percent of the monthly pay of a first-class patrolman per month during the surviving spouse’s life if the spouse did not remarry before September 1, 1983. If the spouse remarried before September 1, 1983, and benefits ceased on the date of remarriage, the benefits for the surviving spouse shall be reinstated on July 1, 1997, and continue during the life of the surviving spouse.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, to the surviving spouse of a member who dies after December 31, 1988, an amount per month, during the spouse’s life, equal to the greater of:

(i) Thirty percent of the monthly pay of a first-class patrolman; or

(ii) Fifty-five percent of the monthly benefit the deceased member was receiving or was entitled to receive on the date of the member’s death.

However, if the deceased member was not entitled to a benefit because the member had not completed 20 years of service, for purposes of computing the amount under subsection (A)(2)(b)(ii) of this section, the member’s benefit shall be considered to be 50 percent of the monthly salary of a first-class patrolman. The amount provided in this subsection is subject to adjustment as provided in subsection (A)(5) of this section.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a payment shall also be made to each child of a deceased member less than 18 years of age in an amount equal to 20 percent of the monthly pay of a first-class patrolman per month:

(a) Until the child becomes 18 years of age;

(b) Until the child becomes 23 years of age if the child is enrolled in and regularly attending a secondary school or is a full-time student at an accredited college or university; or

(c) During the entire period of the child’s physical or mental disability;

whichever period is longer. However, the total of benefits under this subsection added to the benefits under subsection (A)(2) of this section may not exceed the maximum benefits computed under IC 36-8-6-9 for pension payments to a member who retires from active service after 20 years or more of active service. This maximum benefit is equal to 50 percent of the salary of a first-class patrolman in the Police Department plus, for a member who retired before January 1, 1986, two percent of the first-class patrolman’s salary for each year of service of the retired member over 20 years or, for a member who retires after December 31, 1985, plus one percent of the first-class patrolman’s salary for each six months of service of the retired member over 20 years.

When both parents survive, the total amount is still 20 percent, to be paid to them jointly. In all cases of payment to a dependent relative of a deceased member, the board is the final judge of the question of necessity and dependency and of the amount to be paid. The board may also reduce or terminate temporarily or permanently a payment to a dependent relative of a deceased member when it determines that the condition of the fund or other circumstances make this action necessary.

(5) If the salary of a first-class patrolman is increased or decreased, the pension payable under this section shall be proportionately increased or decreased. However, the monthly pension payable to a member or survivor may not be reduced below the amount of the first full monthly pension received by that person.

(B) Members Dying in Line of Duty before September 1, 1982. This subsection (B) shall be interpreted consistent with and in compliance with the requirements of IC 36-8-6-9.7.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a payment shall also be made to each child of a deceased member less than 18 years of age, in an amount equal to 20 percent of the monthly pay of a first-class patrolman per month to each child:

(b) Until the child becomes 23 years of age if the child is enrolled in and regularly attending a secondary school or is a full-time student at an accredited college or university; or

(c) During the entire period of the child’s physical or mental disability;

whichever period is longer. However, the total of benefits under this subsection added to the benefits under subsection (B)(2) of this section may not exceed the maximum benefits computed under IC 36-8-6-9 for pension payments to a member who retires from active service after 20 years or more of active service. This maximum benefit is equal to 50 percent of the salary of a first-class patrolman in the Police Department plus, for a member who retired before January 1, 1986, two percent of the first-class patrolman’s salary for each year of service of the retired member over 20 years or, for a member who retires after December 31, 1985, plus one percent of the first-class patrolman’s salary for each six months of service of the retired member over 20 years.

When both parents survive, the total amount is still 20 percent, to be paid to them jointly. In all cases of payment to a dependent relative of a deceased member, the board is the final judge of the question of necessity and dependency and of the amount to be paid. The board may also reduce or terminate temporarily or permanently a payment to a dependent relative of a deceased member when it determines that the condition of the fund or other circumstances make this action necessary.

(5) If the salary of a first-class patrolman is increased or decreased, the pension payable under this section shall be proportionately increased or decreased. However, the monthly pension payable to a member or survivor may not be reduced below the amount of the first full monthly pension received by that person.

(C) Members Dying in Line of Duty after August 31, 1982. This subsection (C) shall be interpreted consistent with and in compliance with the requirements of IC 36-8-6-10.1.

(1) This section applies to a member of the 1925 Police Pension Fund who dies in the line of duty after August 31, 1982.

(2) The surviving spouse is entitled to a monthly benefit, during the spouse’s lifetime, equal to the benefit to which the member would have been entitled on the date of the member’s death, but no less than 50 percent of the monthly wage received by a first-class patrolman. If the surviving spouse remarried before September 1, 1983, and benefits ceased on the date of remarriage, the benefits for the surviving spouse shall be reinstated on July 1, 1997, and continue during the life of the surviving spouse.

(3) A payment shall also be made to each child of a deceased member less than 18 years of age, in an amount fixed by ordinance, but at least an amount equal to 20 percent of the monthly pay of a first-class patrolman per month to each child:

(a) Until the child becomes 18 years of age;

(b) Until the child becomes 23 years of age if the child is enrolled in and regularly attending a secondary school or is a full-time student at an accredited college or university; or

(c) During the entire period of the child’s physical or mental disability;

whichever period is longer.

(4) The surviving children of the deceased member who are eligible to receive a benefit under subsection (C)(3) of this section may receive an additional benefit in an amount fixed by ordinance, but the total additional benefit under this subsection to all the member’s children may not exceed a total of 30 percent of the monthly wage received by a first-class patrolman. However, this limitation does not apply to the children of a member who are physically or mentally disabled.

(5) If a deceased member leaves no surviving spouse and no child who qualifies for benefits under subsection (C)(3) of this section but does leave a dependent parent or parents, an amount equal to 20 percent of the monthly pay of a first-class patrolman per month from the time of the member’s death shall be paid to the dependent parent or parents during their dependency. When both parents survive, the total amount is still 20 percent, to be paid to them jointly. In all cases of payment to a dependent relative of a deceased member, the board is the final judge of the question of necessity and dependency and of the amount to be paid. The board may also reduce or terminate temporarily or permanently a payment to a dependent relative of a deceased member when it determines that the condition of the fund or other circumstances make this action necessary.

(6) If the salary of a first-class patrolman is increased or decreased, the pension payable under this section shall be proportionately increased or decreased. However, the monthly pension payable to a member or survivor may not be reduced below the amount of the first full monthly pension received by that person.

(7) For the purposes of this section, “dies in the line of duty” means death that occurs as a direct result of personal injury or illness caused by incident, accident, or violence that results from any action that the member in the member’s capacity as a police officer:

(a) Is obligated or authorized by rule, regulation, condition of employment or service, or law to perform; or

(b) The member’s children who are:

(i) Less than 18 years of age; or

(3) If a deceased member of the Fire Department leaves no surviving spouse or children but leaves a dependent parent, and upon satisfactory proof that the parent was wholly dependent upon the deceased member, the local board shall authorize the monthly payment to the parent from the 1937 fund that is prescribed by this section.

If the spouse remarried before September 1, 1983, and benefits ceased on the date of remarriage, the benefits for the surviving spouse shall be reinstated on July 1, 1997, and continue during the life of the surviving spouse. If the pension of the surviving spouse of a deceased member has ceased by virtue of the spouse’s remarriage, and if the person to whom the spouse has remarried was a retired member of the Fire Department who was also entitled to a pension, then upon the death of the member to whom the spouse had remarried, the spouse is entitled to receive a pension as the surviving spouse of a deceased member as though the spouse had not been remarried.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section shall not apply to a public work project performed by the City in accordance with IC 36-1-12-3(b). 

(B) Submissions from Subcontractors.

Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are prequalified must submit a complete application for continuation of “prequalified” standing on a form provided by the City (also referred to as the “short form”) by December 31st for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any prequalified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete application for continuation of “prequalified” standing shall result in automatic removal of the designation, effective January 1st of the upcoming year. However, the “removed” contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on City public works projects.

(2) Any material changes to the contractor’s status, at any time, must be reported in writing within 10 days of its occurrence to the City. The prequalification designation is solely within the discretion of the City and the City specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a stated written reason(s).

(3) Denial of prequalification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any contractor denied or losing prequalification status may request reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in writing to the City within five business days of receipt of notice of denial.

(D) Incomplete Submissions by Bidders. It is the sole responsibility of the potential bidder to comply with all submission requirements applicable to the bidder in this section by no later than the public bid opening. Submissions from subcontractors must be in accordance with subsection (B) of this section. Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by the City may result in the automatic disqualification of the bid.

(E) Responsive and Responsible Bidder Determination. The City, after review of complete and timely submissions, shall, in its sole discretion, after taking into account all information in the submission requirements, determine whether a bidder is responsive and responsible pursuant to IC 36-1-12-4. The City specifically reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the contractor or subcontractor’s submission or any information obtained by the City through its own independent verification of the information provided by the contractor.

(F) Certified Payroll. For public work projects in which the cost is at least $250,000, the successful bidder and all subcontractors working on a public work project shall, upon request by the City, identify the job title, work classification, rate of pay, tax deductions, and craft of each employee on the project, e.g., journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician. The successful bidder and all subcontractors may satisfy the requirements of this section, if requested by the City, by providing the Federal form now known as a WH 347.

(G) Public Records. All information submitted by a bidder or a subcontractor pursuant to this chapter are public records subject to review pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public Records Law (IC 5-14-3). 

(H) Penalties for False, Deceptive, or Fraudulent Statements/Information. Any bidder that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be made, a false, deceptive or fraudulent statement or willfully submits false, deceptive or fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the City shall be disqualified from bidding on all City projects for a period of three years and may be enforced pursuant to EMC 1.05.170 and 1.05.180, or as otherwise provided by statute.

(A) Economic Revitalization Area. Pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-1, an “economic revitalization area” is defined as an area that has become undesirable for, or impossible of, normal development and occupancy because of a lack of development, cessation of growth, deterioration of improvements or character of occupancy, age, obsolescence, substandard buildings, or other factors which have impaired values or prevent a normal development of property or use of property. The term “economic revitalization area” also includes:

(1) Any area where a facility or a group of facilities that are technologically, economically, or energy obsolete are located and where the obsolescence may lead to a decline in employment and tax revenues; and

(2) A residentially distressed area, except as otherwise provided in IC 6-1.1-12.1 et seq.

Such notice shall be provided to each taxing unit that has authority to levy property taxes in the economic revitalization area or residentially distressed area.

(C) Hearing and Confirmatory Resolution. Following approval and adoption of a preliminary resolution, the City Council shall determine whether the qualifications for an economic revitalization area or a residentially distressed area are met and confirm, modify, or rescind the preliminary resolution. This determination should occur at a public hearing for which notice has been provided. If confirmed, a confirmatory resolution is passed. 

(D) Economic Development Target Area. In order to establish an economic development target area, the City Council must pass a designating ordinance pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-7 after receiving a favorable recommendation by the Economic Development Commission. No more than 15 percent of the City’s total geographic territory may be designated in an economic development target area. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]


3.115.060 Tax deduction – Real estate.

(A) Certified Deduction Application. Pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-5, the owner of property which has been declared to be an “economic revitalization area” and who desires to obtain the tax deduction provided by IC 6-1.1-12.1-3 for “property” must file a certified deduction application, on forms prescribed by the State Board of Tax Commissioners, with the County Auditor before May 10th (except as otherwise provided in IC 6-1.1-12.1-5(b) or (e)) of the year in which the addition to the assessed value is made.

(B) Length of Deduction. Projects for which the statement of benefits was approved on or after July 1, 2000 (except as provided in IC 6-1.1-12.1-3(a)), for redevelopment or rehabilitation are eligible for a deduction from the increase in assessed value for a period of one to 10 years. Projects for which the statement of benefits was approved before July 1, 2000, for redevelopment or rehabilitation are eligible for a deduction from the increase in assessed value for periods of three, six, or 10 years. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]


3.115.070 Tax deduction – Manufacturing equipment, research and development equipment, logistical distribution equipment, and information technology.

(A) Certified Deduction Application. The owner of property which has been declared to be an “economic revitalization area” and who desires to obtain the tax deduction provided by IC 6-1.1-12.1-5.4 for “new manufacturing equipment” must file a certified deduction application, on forms prescribed by the State Board of Tax Commissioners, with the County Auditor. A deduction application must be filed in the year in which the new manufacturing equipment is installed and in each of the following years for which abatement is sought. 

(B) Length of Deduction. For projects for which the statement of benefits was approved on or after July 1, 2000, as provided in IC 6-1.1-12.1-4.5(c), an owner of new manufacturing equipment is eligible for a deduction from the assessed value of that equipment for a period of one to 10 years. Projects for which the statement of benefits was approved prior to July 1, 2000, for redevelopment or rehabilitation are eligible for a deduction from the increase in assessed value for periods of five or 10 years. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]


3.115.080 Residentially distressed areas.

(A) Length of Deduction. IC 6-1.1-12.1-2 provides the maximum length of time allowable for deduction within a designated residentially distressed area.

(B) Amount of Deduction. The annual amount of deduction that a property owner is eligible to receive within a designated residentially distressed area shall be calculated in accordance with IC 6-1.1-12.1-4.1. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]


3.115.090 Subsequent statements of benefits.

In the event that a business decides to initiate a tax phase-in for an additional investment which was not included in its tax phase-in application and is of the same type of investment (real estate improvements, new manufacturing equipment, research and development equipment, new logistical distribution equipment, or new information technology) for which the economic revitalization area was designated and said designation is still in effect, the business shall submit a new statement of benefits form to DMD before initiating the additional investment. DMD or its designee shall prepare a resolution for City Council action to approve the subsequent statement of benefits. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]


3.115.100 Compliance with projections and statement of benefits.

(A) Required Submission. Pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-5.9, certain projects shall submit information showing the extent to which there has been compliance with the statement of benefits. Within 45 days from receipt of the information concerning compliance with a statement of benefits, DMD or its designee may determine whether the property owner seeking tax phase-in has substantially complied with the statement of benefits previously approved by the City Council. Further, an applicant for the City’s tax phase-in program may be required to enter into and execute a memorandum of agreement (“MOA”) whereby applicant agrees to (1) supply additional information requested by the City to verify that the applicant has complied with its obligations, (2) terminate any designations or phase-ins if applicant fails to comply with, or does not meet, its obligations, and (3) provide City with liquidated damages or a clawback equal to the amount of all the savings received through the date of such termination. The City’s rights and options pursuant to the MOA shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other rights of review or clawback set forth in this chapter.

(B) Compliance Review. Upon receipt of Form CF-1/PP and other information concerning compliance with a statement of benefits, DMD or its designee shall compare projected investment and job retention and/or creation on the statement of benefits with actual investment and employment information supplied concerning compliance with the statement of benefits. If it does not appear that the taxpayer has substantially complied with the statement of benefits, DMD or its designee shall contact the taxpayer to obtain additional information as to the reasons that taxpayer did not substantially comply with the statement of benefits, whether the taxpayer made reasonable efforts to substantially comply, and whether any failure to comply was caused by factors beyond the control of the taxpayer (such as declines in demand for the property owner’s products or services). DMD shall transmit the compliance review form to the City Council President and Finance Committee Chair.

(C) City Council Review. DMD or its designee shall be responsible for reviewing the compliance review forms. Based on such review and a recommendation by DMD or its designee, City Council shall be responsible for making determinations as to whether a taxpayer has substantially complied with its statement of benefits; and holding hearings for those taxpayers who do not appear to have substantially complied with their statement of benefits. If City Council determines that the taxpayer has not substantially complied with the statement of benefits, it shall establish a date for a compliance hearing.

(D) Hearing Notice. For those projects for which City Council has established a compliance hearing date, DMD or its designee shall prepare a written notice which shall be sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested, and if the project includes new manufacturing equipment or research and development equipment, to the State Board of Tax Commissioners. Said notice shall include the information required by IC 6-1.1-12.1-5.9.

(E) Resolution to Terminate Deduction. For those projects for which a compliance hearing is scheduled, DMD or its designee shall prepare and file a resolution to terminate deduction. Said resolution shall be filed so that it is scheduled for second (and if applicable, third) reading on the scheduled hearing date.

(F) Compliance Hearing. On the scheduled hearing date City Council shall conduct a compliance hearing to determine whether the property owner has made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with the statement of benefits and whether any failure to comply was caused by factors beyond the control of the taxpayer.

(G) City Council Recommendations and Action. 

(1) If City Council determines that the taxpayer did not substantially comply with the statement of benefits and that such failure to comply was not caused by factors beyond the control of the taxpayer, City Council shall adopt a resolution terminating the property owner’s tax deduction. If City Council adopts such a resolution, the deduction does not apply to the next installment of property taxes owed by the property owner or to any subsequent installment of property taxes. 

(2) If City Council determines that the taxpayer did substantially comply with the statement of benefits or that failure to comply was caused by factors beyond control of the taxpayer, City Council shall not pass such a resolution to terminate the deduction.

(3) If the resolution to terminate the deduction is adopted by City Council, DMD shall transmit copies of the resolution to the taxpayer, the Vanderburgh County Auditor and, if the deduction was for new manufacturing equipment, to the State Board of Tax Commissioners. The taxpayer shall also be notified of the amount of total annual deduction to be paid back plus interest at the current prime rate times the number of years deduction was claimed. Such amount will be due 30 days after resolution to terminate is passed. Failure to pay will constitute grounds for a lawsuit to recover amount owed. The City hereby incorporates the provisions of IC 6-1.1-12.1-12 as an alternate remedy if the owner meets the criteria established herein. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]


3.115.110 Severability and effective date.

If any provision of this chapter is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions of this chapter shall not be affected by such a determination. These other provisions of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect without the invalid provision. The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be in full force and effect on the day of its final passage and adoption. [Ord. F-2017-13 § 1, passed 8-15-17.]

5.40.020 License requirements – Certificates of necessity.

(A) No person shall operate for hire on the streets of the City any taxicab without first having obtained a license therefor, as provided in this title.

In the adoption of such an ordinance, consideration shall be given to the demands of the public as to the number, kind, type, equipment, and traffic conditions on the streets of the City.

Said testing program shall be filed along with the application and a copy submitted to the City Director of Administrative Services. The Director of Administrative Services shall review the testing program to ensure that it complies and is consistent with the DOT rules and regulations. If a driver fails to comply with the requirements of the taxicab company’s drug and alcohol program, he shall not be issued a license to operate a taxi. If a failure to comply occurs after being issued a license, the taxicab company shall not permit the driver to drive any of its taxicabs, the taxicab company shall notify the Secretary to the Safety Board of the driver’s failure, and the license shall be revoked by the Safety Board at its next meeting. The driver may appeal the revocation within 30 days of revocation by the Safety Board. [Ord. G-2008-24 § 1, passed 10-8-08; Ord.

(B) No taxicab shall be licensed in any year until it has been inspected by an automobile service facility approved by the Board of Public Safety, and found to be in a safe operating condition in compliance with the manufacturer’s recommendations for equipment safety, or the requirements of the State of Indiana, whichever is more restrictive.

(d) A service facility may not inspect a taxicab if an owner, partner or manager of the service facility has an ownership interest in the taxicab company whose vehicle they are inspecting.

(2) Said vehicle inspection shall consist of inspecting the tires, brakes, suspension system and exterior lights to make sure they are in proper operating condition according to State standards and the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended standards. The Controller’s office shall furnish a form for the inspection facility to complete showing the results of the inspection.

(3) The owner of the taxicab shall not be required to have any corrective service work done by the inspecting service facility.

(C) If on inspection the taxicab is found to be of lawful construction and in proper condition in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and upon payment of the fees set forth in EMC 5.05.060, when so licensed there shall be delivered to the owner, in addition to the license, a card of the size and form prescribed by the City Controller. This card shall contain the official City license number of the taxicab, together with the date of inspection of the taxicab.

On the payment of $1.00 to the City Controller and furnishing proof by affidavit of the loss or destruction of the license or the card, a duplicate thereof shall immediately be issued to the licensee with the notation thereon that it is a duplicate.

(D) The City Controller’s office shall keep a complete and public record of the issuance of each license and all renewals, suspensions, and revocations thereof. Upon reason to believe that a taxicab may not be in proper operating condition as provided in this chapter, the Controller may order an inspection be made at any time to ensure compliance.

(E) No person shall place a taxicab into operation without first having the vehicle inspected as provided in this section. Any person who places a taxicab into operation without having it inspected as required in this section shall be fined $250.00 per violation.

The policy of insurance for each licensed taxicab shall be in the minimum sum of $100,000 conditioned for the payment of any final judgments recovered against the person for the death or injury of persons caused in the operation, maintenance, use, or defective condition of the taxicab. The policy shall be limited to the minimum sum of $300,000 to more than one person, and limit the liability of the insurer to a minimum $100,000 for damages to, or destruction of, property. Any person who operates a taxicab without furnishing the City Controller with a certificate of insurance showing the vehicle is properly insured as required by this chapter shall be subject to a civil fine of $250.00 per violation. Each day a taxicab is operated in violation hereof shall be considered a separate violation.

(B) The insurance policies required herein must contain an endorsement that cancellation of the policy, by the insurer, may be effected only upon 30 days’ written notice by the insurer to the Evansville City Controller of the insurer’s intention to terminate the policy.

If any insurance company whose policy has been so filed pursuant to this section files such notice in the office of the City Controller of its intention to terminate and cancel the policy of insurance and give notice thereof to the named licensee, whereupon after 10 days of the filing, unless the licensee or owner complies with the provisions of this chapter with respect to insurance, the licensee or owner shall cease to operate or cause to be operated within the City the taxicab for hire. The license issued therefor shall be automatically revoked. However, the liability of the insurance company under the canceled or revoked policy for any act or omission of the licensee or owner occurring prior to the effective date of cancellation shall not be discharged or impaired thereby.

(C) In lieu of the policy of insurance herein provided for, the licensee may be self-insured for the first $5,000 and shall present to the City Controller certificates for insurance in excess of the sum up to the limits provided for herein. The licensee shall also place in the hands of the City Controller negotiable securities in the amount of $25,000 to insure the payment by the licensee of any judgment or portion of judgment for which the licensee is self-insured.

(C) All persons holding a properly issued master’s license or journeyman certificate which is currently effective or has been issued or reissued during the year prior to the enactment of this chapter shall automatically qualify for a master’s license or journeyman certificate, as the case may be, without reexamination, but shall be subject to the continuing education requirement. All persons who have successfully passed the required master’s test for a licensed category may utilize the word “master” shall be added to the license.

(D) No business entity, including, but not limited to, a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or other entity recognized under the laws of the State of Indiana, shall practice or perform any craft or trade listed in subsection (A) of this chapter unless an owner, officer, or full-time employee shall possess a valid license therefor issued under this chapter. For the purposes of this subsection (D), “full-time employee” shall mean a person who performs not less than an average of 35 or more hours of service to the business entity per calendar week, excluding company-recognized holidays, sick leave, vacations, or other time off under the business entity’s personnel policy.

Prior to practicing any craft or trade, a business entity shall obtain a certificate of registration in the name of the business entity from the Department of Buildings. Said certificate of registration application shall be completed under oath, signed by the person holding the craft or trade license, and shall contain the following information:

(1) Name of the business entity;

(2) Permanent business address, local business address and telephone number of the business;

(3) Whether the person completing the application is a full-time employee, officer or owner of the business entity;

(5) Craft or trade license which the person completing the application has been issued under this code; and

(6) Any other information deemed necessary by the Building Commissioner to aid in enforcement.

(E)(1) It shall be a violation of this chapter for a company or individual to subvert the licensing and permit requirements established by this chapter by employing an individual or another contractor holding the required licenses for the sole purpose of avoiding the requirements of this code when the company and/or its employees cannot meet the requirements for obtaining master’s or journeyman licenses or for registration as apprentices. Such actions shall constitute the act of “piggybacking” which shall be a violation of this code. All persons doing work requiring a license to obtain a permit to do the work shall be the licensee, an employee of the licensee, or an employee of a company that legitimately employs the licensee for the practice of his craft. All nonlicensed employees performing such work are required to be under the immediate direction and control of the person having the license. When a licensee obtains a permit to do the work, an officer of the company employing the licensee shall sign an affidavit, as part of the application for a permit, stating that the licensee is a bona fide employee of the company and agreeing that all persons doing work under that permit are bona fide employees of the permit holder/company. It shall be a violation to fail to comply with the provisions of this subsection.

(2) The Licensing and Disciplinary Board shall, upon its own motion or at the request of the Building Commissioner or upon the written complaint of any individual, investigate allegations of piggybacking. Such investigation may include subpoenaing records of the licensee, employee and/or employer, subpoenaing individuals to give testimony, and subpoenaing any other information that is pertinent to the investigation. Information subpoenaed during the course of an investigation by the Licensing and Disciplinary Board shall remain confidential and open for inspection only to the Building Commissioner, Mayor, City Attorney’s office, and City Engineer, except where litigation has been commenced or when required by State law.

Upon a finding that the act of piggybacking has occurred, the board shall deny or revoke the permit that has been issued, and/or revoke for up to one year, or suspend for not less than three months, the license of any master or journeyman or registration of the apprentice participating in such prohibited act of piggybacking.

(3) The permit holder, the license holder, the Building Commissioner or any aggrieved party may request a hearing before the Licensing and Disciplinary Board. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions found in EMC 5.70.050. Any person who has had his license revoked may not reapply for a new license before one year has passed from the date of revocation.

(4) In addition to revocations and suspensions of licenses and permits provided for above, a person who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500.00 nor more than $2,500 per violation. Each incidence of violation shall be considered a separate offense. This section may also be enforced by an injunctive relief in a court of law.

Failure to obtain or maintain a certificate of registration shall be a violation of this chapter and subject the business entity to a fine of not less than $500.00 or more than $2,500 per violation with each day being a separate violation. In addition to a fine, the business entity may be enjoined by a Court from further violation.

The trade or craft licensee completing the application shall be responsible and liable for all acts and conduct of the business entity which he represents, insofar as compliance with the terms and requirements of this chapter are concerned.

The business entity and the license holder shall cooperate with the Building Commissioner in providing documentation confirming that the license holder is an owner, officer, or full-time employee. Failure to provide such information within 48 hours of a request shall entitle the Building Commissioner to issue a stop work order, issue a citation for violation of this section, terminate the certificate of registration, and suspend the license of the licensee pending a hearing before the License Disciplinary Board.

The business entity obtaining the certificate of registration shall maintain the information required herein in Vanderburgh County. [Ord. G-2006-12, passed 6-20-06; Ord. G-2005-3, passed 1-26-05; Ord. G-99-5, passed 4-5-99; Ord. G-98-20, passed 7-6-98; Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93; Ord. G-83-56, passed 12-12-83; Ord.

Any vehicle used for transportation of materials or equipment for performance of any activity for which a license is required by this chapter shall be conspicuously and clearly marked with the business or company name, category of work permitted by the license, and the license number.

The owner, at the time of permit issuance, shall attest by affidavit that either the owner or a member of the immediate family described above is to perform the work. In the case of an owner subcontracting footing, foundation, framing, or roofing to other than an immediate family, the contractor doing those installations shall be licensed and their names provided to the Department of Buildings at the time of permit application. In lieu of providing the names of the licensed contractors for the above installations, the owner shall answer basic questions relative to code requirements indicating the owner has sufficient knowledge to properly perform the work.

If the Inspector is not satisfied that the owner or immediate family is capable of performing, or if the character of any work performed indicates the owner or immediate family members are not qualified or capable of doing the work, the Inspector may require a portion or all of the work be installed, changed, altered, or repaired by a qualified licensed contractor.

This alternate-to-training provision is limited to one year, after which the person must have passed the journeyman test or be enrolled in a related vocational training program. Apprentice-level employees may not work alone on the practice of their trade but must be accompanied by a licensed journeyman or master. No more than three apprentice-level employees may be supervised by each journeyman or master.

The registration shall state the name of the employer, the name, age and address of the apprentice, and either the training program in which the apprentice is enrolled or the date on which the alternative-to-training time period will expire.

Any person having custody of an animal, as owner or otherwise, shall provide such animal with necessary and adequate care, food, drink, space, shelter, and protection from the elements, as set forth below:

(A) Food. The food shall be given daily and be wholesome, palatable, and free of contamination. Food shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to meet the normal daily requirements for the condition and size of the animal.

(B) Water. Potable water is to be accessible to animals at all times; it shall be maintained at least two times per day, except as otherwise might be directed by a veterinarian. Water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary so as not to be a health hazard to the animal.

(C) Housing Facilities. “Housing facility” means any structure, building or housing intended to house animals.

(1) Shelter from Sunlight. When sunlight is likely to cause overheating, serious bodily injury or death of the animal, sufficient shade shall be provided to allow the vertebrate animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from the direct rays of the sun. No person shall confine or allow his or her animal to remain outdoors without access to appropriate shelter from the elements.

(2) Shelter from Rain or Snow. Domestic animals shall be provided with access to housing facilities to allow them to remain dry during rain or snow.

(3) Shelter from Cold Weather. Housing facilities shall be provided for all domestic animals kept outdoors when the atmospheric temperature falls below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Such structure shall be provided with a sufficient quantity of suitable bedding material, consisting of hay, straw, cedar shavings or the equivalent, to provide insulation and protection against cold and dampness and promote retention of body heat. Such shelter shall be so constructed to keep the animal dry and retain sufficient body heat to prevent serious bodily injury or death of the animal.

(D) Primary Enclosures. All gates and doors to the exterior of the primary enclosure shall have tumbler-type locks. Such locks shall mean a key or combination-type lock.

(1) All primary enclosures for domestic animals shall conform to the following requirements: Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain them. Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to enable the domestic animal to have access to a housing facility in order to remain dry and clean.

(2) Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to move about freely and to easily stand, sit and lie in a comfortable normal position.

In addition to the provisions of the preceding subsections, each dog or cat housed in any primary enclosures shall be provided a minimum of 40 square feet of floor space for an animal 10 pounds or less; for each additional 10 pounds an additional 10 square feet shall be added to the total enclosure. This paragraph shall not apply to animal dealers, kennels or veterinarians unless the animal is kept on the premises for three or more months.

(3) No dog or cat shall have a tether as its primary security device or as its primary enclosure. The supervised temporary tethering of a dog or cat is permitted for no longer than one hour at a time. If temporary tethers are used as a restraint, the tethers used shall be so placed or attached that they cannot become entangled with the tethering of other animals or any other objects. Such tethering shall be of a type commonly used for the size dog or cat by means of a well-fitted collar. No animal shall be hitched, tied or fastened by any rope, chain or cord that is directly attached to the animal’s neck. Animals that must be tied, hitched, or fastened to restrain them must wear a properly fitted collar or harness. The tying device shall be attached to the animal’s collar or harness. Such chain, rope, or cord shall be at least 10 feet long and have swivels at both ends. Animals may be tethered to a cable run only with the custodian present in the same yard with the animal. Any tether must have swivels on both ends. The tether must be attached to a properly fitting collar or harness.

(4) Not more than six adult cats (over eight weeks of age) shall be housed in the same primary enclosure. This subsection shall not apply to animal dealers, kennels or veterinarians unless the animal is kept on the premises for three or more months.

(E) No person shall torture, beat, mutilate, overload, overwork, cruelly treat or otherwise abuse any animal so as to result in serious bodily injury or death of the animal. It shall be a defense to this subsection that the actions taken by a person accused of the violation were reasonably necessary to prevent injury to himself, another person, another animal or destruction or substantial damage to property.

If the actions prohibited above constitute a criminal violation, the criminal violation shall be pursued instead of an ordinance violation.

(F) An animal shall be leashed when it is off the owner’s property. One end of the leash shall be attached to the collar or harness and the other end attached to the person accompanying the animal. This provision shall not apply to an animal that is otherwise physically restrained at any facility.

Upon receiving the report of a bite, Animal Care and Control will quarantine the animal for 10 days with the place of confinement to be in the discretion of Animal Care and Control based upon whether the animal is vaccinated and whether the owner has the proper facilities to prevent the animal from escaping or coming into contact with other persons or animals. During the quarantine period, the animal is to be securely confined and kept from contact with any other animal or noncustodian. During the quarantine period, the owner must provide a current rabies vaccination certificate for his or her cat or dog that is being quarantined. If proof of vaccination cannot be supplied, a veterinarian shall vaccinate the animal before release at the owner’s expense. Indiana law and Department of Health rules and regulations shall be followed for reporting animal bites.

 

(B) No person other than an Animal Care and Control Officer or veterinarian shall kill or cause to be killed any animal suspected of being rabid except in cases of immediate self-protection. If the animal is killed, the person causing the death will retain the body and immediately notify Animal Care and Control.

(C) Violation of these quarantine provisions shall constitute an offense and shall subject the responsible party to civil penalties under EMC 6.05.180. [1983 Code § 9.90.11.]


6.05.090 Exposure – Proclamation by Mayor.

If the Mayor determines that a danger to the City is posed by rabies, he may issue a proclamation ordering all custodians of animals capable of contracting rabies to muzzle the animals, confine them to the custodian’s immediate premises, or both, for a time designated in the proclamation. Failure to comply with the proclamation is a violation of this chapter. Notice of the proclamation shall be effective upon posting the notice at the Civic Center and in the other council districts. The notice shall be advertised in each newspaper published in the City qualifying for legal ads under IC 5-3-1. [1983 Code § 9.90.12.]

The time period for quarantine and conditions of the quarantine shall be conducted under the rules and regulations and orders of the State Board of Health.

(C) No person other than a duly authorized agent of Animal Care and Control may destroy any domestic animal; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to the following:

(1) A licensed veterinarian;

(2) Those persons acting in immediate self-protection; or

(3) Law enforcement officers or firefighters acting to prevent undue suffering. [1983 Code § 9.90.13.]


6.05.110 Animal Control and Education Commission.

(A) The Animal Control and Education Commission is hereby established. It shall consist of nine members, seven appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the Common Council and two appointed by the County Commissioners. Members are to serve for a term of four years. Members shall serve at the pleasure of their appointing authority. No more than six commissioners may be members of the same political party. Commission officers shall be a chairperson, vice-chairperson, and secretary.

(B) Commissioners shall serve without remuneration, but shall receive reimbursement for expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties. For a commissioner to receive reimbursement for expenses a claim must be submitted by the commissioner to the commission and approved by a majority of the members thereof and any claim so submitted shall be subject to the appropriation of funds by (1) the Common Council, in the case of commissioners appointed by the Mayor, or (2) the County Council, in the case of commissioners appointed by the County Commissioners.

(C) The Animal Control Officer shall be appointed by the Mayor and shall see to the proper administration of this chapter and the animal shelter in accordance with the rules, regulations and directives of the Animal Control and Education Commission and the Board of Public Works. The Animal Control Officer shall be sworn in as a special law enforcement officer under the direction and supervision of the Board of Public Works.

(D) The Humane Officer shall attend the meetings of the commission and carry out its directives to the extent he is allowed and empowered by State law.

(E) The commission shall approve or disapprove all applications for permits and licenses for animals based on the commission’s determination as to whether the applicant has complied with this chapter and demonstrates a reasonable probability of continued compliance. The commission is empowered to revoke licenses and permits as provided in this chapter. Restrictions, regulations and orders necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter or any restrictions, rules or regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter may be issued by the commission; however, rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of the animal shelter must be approved by the Board of Public Works. The commission may from time to time prescribe rules and regulations pertaining to what constitutes unclean, overcrowded and inadequately ventilated confines of an animal; however, these rules and regulations may only be used to determine whether a permit should be issued or revoked and for no other purpose. Any restrictions, rules or regulations that may be adopted by the commission pursuant to this chapter must be reviewed and approved by the Common Council. Animal Care and Control has authority to issue licenses for ferrets, dogs and cats; however, a decision to disapprove any license or revoke any license may be appealed to the commission which shall have final authority over such issuance, denial or revocation of any animal license.

(F) If the commission finds that the nature of a particular animal or the area in which it is kept may in any way endanger the public health, safety, or welfare, it may impose conditions on a license or permit and breach of those conditions shall be cause for revocation of the license and a violation of this chapter.

(G) The commission shall inspect the Animal Care and Control shelter at any time during business hours. Any findings are to be brought to the attention of the Director of Transportation and Services. [Ord. G-2018-7, passed 3-14-18. 1983 Code § 9.90.20.]

6.05.130 Animal Care and Control shelter.

(A) The operation of the Animal Care and Control shelter is under the supervision of the Board of Public Works which shall adopt and enforce rules for the operation of the Animal Care and Control shelter as needed to carry out the intent of this chapter.

(B) The Animal Care and Control Officer may cause the apprehension and impoundment of an animal which is not on the property of the owner so long as the animal is on public property, public right-of-way or on private property without the consent of the owner of the private property. Since the apprehension of the animal is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, the capture of the animals is a valid exercise of the City’s law enforcement power. Therefore, the Animal Care and Control Officer and his designee may use any means reasonably calculated to capture the animal in a manner which presents the least danger to other persons and property. The Animal Care and Control Officer may enter on private property without the consent of the owner or person in control of the property only under the following circumstances:

(1) With a court order or warrant authorizing entry onto the property for the purposes stated in the order or warrant; or

(2) Where exigent circumstances dictate immediate apprehension in order to prevent harm or danger to a person or animal, including, but not limited to, where an animal has bitten a person or animal and the animal is not under restraint.

(C) If any dangerous animal is not under restraint and cannot be captured safely and impounded, it may be slain by a law enforcement officer. Impounded dangerous animals will not be sold or allowed to be redeemed except upon approval of the Animal Control and Education Commission.

(D) The Animal Care and Control Officer shall record a description of impounded animals on forms approved by the commission. If an animal is licensed, the licensee will be notified and the identity of the animal shall be recorded and kept available for public inspection.

(E) Animal Care and Control shall maintain all impounded licensed (with tag) or microchipped animals for a minimum of seven days, unless as otherwise provided for injured or diseased animals, or until claimed by the owner. Untagged and unmicrochipped animals shall be maintained for no longer than seven days, unless as otherwise provided for injured or diseased animals, so long as space allows at the shelter. If the animal is not redeemed within the appropriate time period, the Animal Care and Control Officer shall destroy it in a humane manner as established by NACA (National Animal Control Association) or sell it as commission rules and regulations may permit. Upon sale by the Animal Care and Control Officer of any animal, the bill of sale shall transfer to the buyer the title of the original owner in and to the animal. All proceeds of such sales, together with a bill of sale, shall be delivered to the City Controller. Unlicensed animals apparently in pain may be destroyed on receipt at Animal Care and Control in the discretion of the Animal Care and Control Officer.

(F) Fees for Reclaiming or Redeeming Animals.

(1) A custodian may redeem a quarantined animal before its destruction by paying a fee of $20.00 plus $5.00 for each day, or fraction thereof, of impoundment up to 10 days, for a total maximum of $55.00 plus any fees and fines required by this chapter and rabies voucher costs. If the animal does not have a current rabies vaccination, the custodian must arrange to have the animal vaccinated for rabies as per commission regulations.

(2) A custodian may reclaim a nonquarantined animal by paying a fee of $7.00 plus $5.00 per day for each day (or fractional part thereof) plus license fees or fines in accordance with this chapter.

(G) A person who adopts from the Animal Care and Control shelter a domestic animal, which has not been spayed or neutered, shall have that animal spayed or neutered. To promote compliance with this subsection (G), the commission is authorized to establish a program which may include a prepayment voucher system.

(H) All dogs or cats adopted out by the Animal Care and Control shelter shall be microchipped before release.

(I) The Superintendent or designee of Animal Care and Control can waive all fines and citations if the owner agrees to have their animal spayed/neutered and microchipped, before the animal is returned to the owner, at the owner’s expense.

(J) An animal that has been previously impounded stray or at large and is now redeemed for the second or subsequent redemption will be required to be spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian at the owner’s expense. Arrangements to perform the procedure must be made within 24 hours of reclaim and enforcement action pending spay/neuter will be issued at the time of reclaim.

(K) Any dog or cat reclaimed from Evansville Animal Care and Control must be microchipped prior to the owner taking possession of the dog or cat.

(L) Notwithstanding any provision within this chapter, Animal Care and Control may refuse an adoption to any person if: (1) there exists a violation of this chapter, or (2) the person has committed an act in any state within the last two years which would constitute a violation of IC 35-46-3 or this chapter. A conviction in a court shall constitute a violation. The commission shall determine if the findings of a court of another state constitute a violation of IC 35-46-3. Such person shall cooperate in determining whether a violation occurred. [Ord. G-2019-14 § 3, passed 11-14-19; Ord. G-2016-17, passed 4-28-16; Ord. G-2018-7, passed 3-14-18. 1983 Code § 9.90.22.]


6.05.140 Violations.

(A) Any person, including a commissioner of the Animal Control and Education Commission, the Animal Control Officer, or a Humane Officer, may execute a verified complaint alleging that a person has committed a prohibited act, thereby requiring the appearance of that person in the appropriate court.

(B) Procedure for the Handling of Complaints of Violations.

(1) It shall be required of any person complaining to the Animal Control Officers or Police Department representatives, regarding domestic animals, to sign a complaint form to be provided by the City describing the animal and the violation, and to make known to the official the owner of the animal if known by the complainant.

(2) One such identified complaint shall be sufficient cause for the Animal Care and Control Superintendent or City Police to issue a warning to the owner, or to impound the animal under procedures outlined in this chapter in accordance with the law. [1983 Code § 9.90.24.]


6.05.150 Regulation of dangerous animals.

(A) Actions Allowed by Authorized Persons Prior to Hearing.

(1) If any animal shall attack a person or a pet peaceably conducting himself in any place where he may lawfully be, any person, for the purpose of preventing imminent injury or further injury, may use such force as is required to stop the attack.

(2) A law enforcement officer or ACO acting pursuant to his statutory duties may, where the threat of serious injury to a person or pet is imminent and unjustified, use such force as is required to prevent such injury.

(B) An animal may not be declared dangerous:

(1) If the animal was protecting or defending a person within the imminent vicinity of the animal from an attack or assault;

(2) If at the time the recipient of the attack was committing a crime or offense upon the property of the owner or custodian of the animal;

(3) If the recipient of the attack was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the animal, or in the past had teased, tormented, abused or assaulted the animal;

(4) If the animal was attacked or menaced by another animal, or the animal attacked was on the property of its owner or custodian;

(5) If the animal was responding to pain or injury, or protecting itself, its kennels or its offspring;

(6) If the person or domestic animal was disturbing the animal’s natural functions such as sleeping or eating;

(7) Neither growling nor barking, nor both, shall alone constitute grounds upon which to find an animal to be “dangerous.”

(C) Complaint Procedure.

(1) Any person may make a complaint of an alleged dangerous dog as that term is defined herein to an ACO. Such officers shall immediately inform the complainant of his right to commence a proceeding provided for in subsection (C)(2) of this section, and, if there is reason to believe the animal is a dangerous animal, the ACO shall forthwith commence such proceeding himself.

(2) Any person may make a complaint under oath or affirmation of an alleged dangerous animal, as that term is defined herein, to the commission. Thereupon, the president of the commission or his/her designee, subject to ratification by the commission at an open-door hearing, shall determine if there is probable cause to believe the animal is a dangerous animal and, if so, shall issue an order to an ACO directing such officer to immediately seize such animal and hold same pending a commission determination as herein provided. If the custodian of the animal refuses to surrender the animal to the ACO, the ACO shall seek a court order authorizing the seizure of the animal. If the animal is found running loose off of the property of the custodian, no such court order shall be necessary. The commission shall, within seven business days of a request for a hearing or at a time as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, and upon written notice of not less than three days to the owner of the animal, hold a hearing on the complaint.

(D) Destruction of the Dangerous Animal. The commission may order an animal destroyed if none of the precautions in subsection (E) of this section are deemed sufficient to prevent the risk of injury to any person.

(E) Where an animal is determined, pursuant to a preponderance of the evidence at a duly constituted hearing, to be “dangerous,” the commission, subject to judicial review, shall require the owner of said animal to register such animal with the animal shelter, and to provide prompt notification to the animal shelter of any changes in the ownership of the animal; names, addresses and telephone numbers of new owners; any change in the health status of the animal; any further instances of attack; any claims made or lawsuits brought as a result of further instances of attack; or the death of the animal. In addition, the commission, subject to judicial review, may require any or all of the following, but subsections (E)(5), (6) and (11) of this section, or any one of them, may only be imposed where there has been serious injury to a person.

(1) Indoors, when not alone, the animal must be under the control of a person 18 years or older.

(2) Outdoors and unattended, the animal must be kept within a locked fenced area from which it cannot escape.

(3) When outdoors the animal must be attended and kept within a fenced area from which it cannot escape.

(4) When outdoors the animal must be attended and kept on a leash no longer than six feet and under the control of a person 18 years of age or older.

(5) When outdoors the animal must be attended and muzzled. Such muzzle shall not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration but shall prevent it from biting any person or animal. The muzzle must be made of nonmetallic material so as to prevent the muzzle from freezing to the animal.

(6) Outdoors and unattended, the animal must be confined to an escape-proof kennel of the following description:

(a) Such kennel shall allow the animal to stand normally and without restriction, and shall be in compliance with EMC 6.05.060 concerning primary enclosures, and shall protect the animal from the elements.

(b) Fencing materials shall not have openings with a diameter of more than two inches, and in the case of wooden fences, the gaps shall not be more than two inches.

(c) Any gates within such kennel or structure shall be lockable and of such design as to prevent the entry of children or the escape of the animal, and when the animal is confined to such kennel and unattended such locks shall be kept locked.

(d) The kennel may be required to have double exterior walls to prevent the insertion of fingers, hands, or other objects.

(7) Placement of a sign or signs of a description and in places directed by the commission, advising the public of the presence and tendencies of said animal.

(8) Attendance by the animal and its owner/custodian at training sessions conducted by a certified applied animal behaviorist, board certified veterinary behaviorist or other recognized expert in the field and completion of training or any other treatment as deemed appropriate by such expert. The owners of the animal shall be responsible for all costs associated with the evaluation and training ordered under this section.

(9) Neutering or spaying of the animal at the owner’s expense, unless medically contraindicated.

(10) That the animal be permanently identified by tattooing or by injecting an identification microchip, using standard veterinary procedures and practices, identification number and the identification of the person performing the procedure to be registered with the animal shelter as indicated above.

(11) The procurement of liability insurance in an amount to be determined by the commission, but in no case in an amount of less than $500,000, covering the medical and/or veterinary costs resulting from future actions of the animal. This condition may not be imposed if it is shown that no such insurance is available for a reasonable premium.

(12) If any of the above conditions ordered by the commission, subject to judicial review, are not complied with, the owner shall be subject to a fine of not more than $2,500.

(13) If a further incident of attack occurs under such circumstances that the dog, after a hearing as described above, is determined to be a dangerous dog, the commission, subject to judicial review, may impose or re-impose any applicable directives listed above; additionally, humane destruction of the dog may be ordered, but only where the further incident involves serious injury to a person.

(14) Order the animal to be examined by a veterinarian to rule out an underlying treatable medical cause which may be causing the animal to be aggressive. Such examination shall be at the owner’s expense.

(F) Procedure before Commission.

(1) The ACO or designee is hereby authorized to declare an animal to be a dangerous animal. Notice of such declaration shall be served personally upon the owner, or his authorized agent, or served by mailing the notice, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon the owner or his authorized agent. If mailed, the notice shall be deemed effective three business days from depositing the notice in the United States mail. The notice shall indicate that the animal is declared to be a dangerous animal and that if written appeal of the ACO’s decision is not filed within 10 days with the Animal Control and Education Commission through the City Clerk’s office, the animal shall be destroyed. If ownership of the animal cannot be determined, the animal may be destroyed after detaining the animal for five business days without notice or further action by the department or the commission.

(2) Upon notice of the declaration of the animal to be a dangerous animal, the animal, if not already held in quarantine by the department, shall be surrendered to the ACO pending a decision by the commission on the disposition of the animal or imposition of conditions referred to above. If not voluntarily surrendered to the ACO, a warrant or other court order shall be obtained for the ACO to obtain immediate possession of the animal. No consent or court approval shall be required to obtain possession of the animal if the animal is not under restraint and is not on the property of the owner or his authorized agent.

(3) The timely filing of an appeal of a decision of the ACO to the commission shall stay the decision of the ACO to destroy the animal until a hearing can be held by the commission and a decision rendered thereon. If a hearing is requested, notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the hearing shall be given to the owner or his authorized agent. The commission shall review the evidence and render a decision that reverses in whole or in part the decision of the ACO or affirms a decision of the ACO that the animal is dangerous. Upon a finding that the animal is dangerous, the commission may impose one or more of the conditions stated in subsection (E) of this section or have the animal destroyed. A decision of the commission, if appealed, shall be appealed by filing a verified complaint for judicial review with the Vanderburgh County Circuit or Superior Court. The verified complaint must be filed within 10 days after the date the commission has taken action. An appeal under this section is an action de novo. The court may affirm, modify, or reverse the action taken by the commission.

(4) If the decision of the commission or the final decision of the courts upon appeal is that the animal is dangerous, the owner shall be responsible for payment of the following fees:

(a) A custodial fee of: $20.00 administrative fee plus $5.00 per day until time of the commission’s decision and thereafter $10.00 per day, or for any part of a day, for shelter and food for the animal, plus medical expenses and other costs incurred by the department for the apprehension and maintenance of the animal, and for treatment of the animal while detained. These charges shall accrue until consent is given for destruction of the animal or until the animal is destroyed.

(b) If the decision of the commission or any final decision of the courts upon appeal is that the animal is not dangerous and should be released to the owner, then those charges, as provided herein, shall not be charged to the owner.

(5) An animal that is not under restraint and cannot be safely captured and impounded may be slain.

(G) No person shall own, keep, or harbor a dangerous animal within the City, except for dangerous animals in compliance with the orders of the commission as provided above. This section shall not apply to animals under the control of a law enforcement or military agency, Mesker Park Zoo and Botanic Garden, or a properly permitted circus demonstrating that the animals are in secure enclosures and monitored by trained individuals. [Ord. G-2019-14 § 5, passed 11-14-19. 1983 Code § 9.90.30.]


6.05.160 Animals prohibited from certain public gatherings.

(A) No person shall bring, or maintain in his possession or control, any animal to any public gathering of 500 or more persons upon any public property without permission from the City board having jurisdiction over said property. Permission shall be given by such board only in the following circumstances:

(1) The vertebrate animal is to participate in some aspect of the event; and

(2) The vertebrate animal does not present a threat to the public health, safety or welfare.

(B) This section shall not apply to:

(1) Handicapped persons who have need of a specially trained dog to safely and effectively carry out their activities;

(2) Events on private property; or

(3) City, County, State, or Federal law enforcement officers while acting as such.

(C) Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to a fine of $25.00 for each violation. Each day a violation occurs may be a separate violation. Additionally, any person who violates this section shall immediately and safely remove the vertebrate animal from the public gathering. [1983 Code § 9.90.52.]


6.05.170 Funding of emergency veterinarian services.

Ten percent of all license and permit fees shall be placed in a separate fund to pay for the costs of medical care for stabilization for injured or sick animals under the care of Animal Care and Control. If owners can be located, the owners shall be responsible for reimbursement of the cost of these services when the pet is reclaimed. [Ord. G-2016-17, passed 4-28-16. 1983 Code § 9.90.53.]


6.05.180 Penalties and fees.

(A) Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine, court order to comply, and revocation of licenses or permits issued, such revocation following notice and hearing. Violations of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for denial of the issuance of a license or permit if in the opinion of the commission such prior acts indicate the applicant’s inability to comply in the future.

Essential components include, but are not limited to, single point termination telephone access to the system; fully centralized professional dispatching and system status management by medically trained dispatchers in direct radio contact with every ambulance operating in the system and who have the full authority and responsibility to manage system response under all circumstances; compatible equipment inventories of first responders, basic life support units, and paramedic units; rapid first responder and paramedic unit response times to life-threatening emergencies; and continuous, orderly and routine physician supervision, evaluation and authoritative corrective action to ensure persistent upgrading of overall system performance.

“Medical audit” means an official inquiry into the circumstances involving an ambulance run or request for service. No physician performing a medical audit shall have been directly involved in the care of the patient who is the subject of the audit. The medical audit procedure is intended to be educational and positive and not vindictive or punitive. Any individual whose actions are under review may not be excluded from the audit process and shall have the right to appear and be heard.

Article III. Vehicle Immobilization Devices


10.15.390 Use of vehicle immobilization devices.

(A) There is hereby established a procedure providing for the immobilization of vehicles which have accumulated more than three unpaid parking citations (which citations have not been paid within 30 days of issuance) which have not been challenged in Court by the owner of the vehicle, under this chapter or which have been challenged and determined to have been properly issued.

(B) All parking citations (tickets) issued by the City Clerk (or other authorized personnel) shall have a notice on said citation reading as follows:

NOTICE – If you believe this parking ticket was improperly issued and if you wish to challenge the ticket you must go, in person, to the City Clerk’s Office in Room 314 of the Civic Center Complex, 1 NW Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd., (812) 436-4992 within ten (10) business days and you will be informed of the Challenge Procedure. Failure to appear at the City Clerk’s Office within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the citation will be considered a waiver of your right to challenge the ticket.

NOTICE OF IMMOBILIZATION – If you accumulate more than three (3) unpaid, unchallenged parking citations your vehicle may have affixed to it an immobilization device rendering your vehicle inoperable. If your vehicle is immobilized there will be certain fees and charges to be paid by you prior to the immobilization device being removed from your vehicle.

(C) Challenge of Parking Citations. If the owner of a vehicle who receives a parking citation believes the citation was improperly issued, the person may challenge the citation by:

(1) Going in person, within 10 business days, to the office of the City Clerk and requesting the issuance of the citation be reviewed by the City Clerk.

(2) The City Clerk shall, within three business days, investigate the issuance of the citation.

(3) Within three business days after completing the investigation of the issuance of the citation, the City Clerk shall, by regular U.S. mail, notify the owner of the vehicle regarding the results of the investigation.

(4) If the City Clerk determines the citation to have been improperly issued the City Clerk shall void the citation.

(5) If the City Clerk determines the citation to have been properly issued the owner of the vehicle may further challenge the citation by presenting him/herself at the City Clerk’s office within 10 business days after the date of the notice of determination by the City Clerk and requesting, by written form prepared by the City Clerk, that the City of Evansville initiate a small claims action against the owner of the vehicle to determine the validity of the citation. The owner of the vehicle shall be advised by the City Clerk that if the matter is taken to small claims court and if a judgment is entered against the owner of the vehicle regarding the citation that court costs will be assessed against the owner of the vehicle.

(6) If the City Clerk is unavailable, the Deputy City Clerk shall have authority to act on her behalf herein.

(D) If a vehicle (license plate) accumulates more than three unpaid parking citations which have not been challenged by the owner of the vehicle or which have been challenged and determined to have been properly issued, the City Clerk may, upon locating the vehicle on a City street, City parking lot or in a City-operated parking garage, affix to the vehicle a device rendering the vehicle inoperable.

(E) There shall be a fee assessed against the owner of an immobilized vehicle in the amount of $40.00, or $65.00 if the immobilization device is removed from the vehicle after normal business hours of the City Clerk’s office. This fee is assessed to cover the City Clerk’s cost associated with the immobilization.

(F) Release of Immobilized Vehicles. The owner of a vehicle which has been immobilized may have the vehicle released in the following manner:

(1) By appearing at the City Clerk’s office within two business days of the immobilization of the vehicle and paying to the City Clerk the total of all unpaid parking citations outstanding against the license plate plus the immobilization fee. If the total of the unpaid parking citations exceeds $200.00 the Clerk may accept payment of $200.00 plus the immobilization fee and have the person sign a promissory note to the City of Evansville for payments in the amount of $10.00 per week. The promissory note shall advise the person that if they fail to make a weekly payment as agreed the vehicle (license plate) will be subject to immobilization if there remain more than three unpaid parking citations.

(2) If the owner of a vehicle which has been immobilized believes there were not more than three unchallenged (or which have been challenged and determined to have been properly issued) unpaid parking citations outstanding against the license plate on the immobilized vehicle and if the owner desires to challenge the immobilization, the owner may have the vehicle released by doing the following:

(a) The owner must appear in person at the City Clerk’s office within two business days of the immobilization of the vehicle; and

(b) Post a bond with the City Clerk in an amount equal to the immobilization fee plus the amount of outstanding or unpaid parking citations plus $90.00. However, in no event shall the bond exceed $200.00 plus the amount of the immobilization fee plus $90.00. The bond so posted shall be held by the City Clerk in a separate fund until a determination is made by the Hearing Officer regarding the challenge to the immobilization of the vehicle; and

(c) Sign an affidavit, pursuant to the penalties of perjury, wherein the owner states: (i) that the owner denies there are more than three unchallenged, unpaid parking citations outstanding against the license plate on the vehicle at the time of immobilization; (ii) that if the owner fails to appear for the hearing on the challenge to the immobilization the bond posted by the owner will be forfeited; (iii) that the owner understands that if the Hearing Officer finds the immobilization of the vehicle was proper under this chapter that the bond will be forfeited to the City of Evansville; (iv) the owner will sign a promissory note to the City of Evansville for the payment of the balance of any parking fines not paid out of the bond at the rate of $10.00 per week; (v) that the owner understands that if a promissory note is signed providing for weekly payments and if a weekly payment is not make as agreed that the vehicle will be subject to immobilization if there remain more than three unpaid parking citations; and

(d) If a person challenges the immobilization of their vehicle and complies with the procedure set forth above, the City Clerk shall arrange for a hearing to be held within 24 hours of the posting of the bond (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, or holidays as established by the City of Evansville). The hearing shall be conducted by a licensed attorney-at-law who may not otherwise be an employee of the City of Evansville. The only issue to be determined by the Hearing Officer will be whether there were more than three unchallenged, unpaid parking citations issued to the license plate on the vehicle at the time of the immobilization. The Attorney serving as the Hearing Officer shall be paid $90.00 for conducting the hearing; and

(e) If the Hearing Officer determines there were not more than three unchallenged, unpaid parking citations issued to the license plate on the vehicle at the time of the immobilization, the bond posted by the owner of the vehicle and the immobilization fee and the $90.00 shall be refunded to the owner within one business day following proper execution by the owner of a claim form as required by the State Board of Accounts.

(G) After-Hours Release of Immobilized Vehicles. The City Clerk shall establish a procedure whereby an immobilized vehicle may be released after the normal business hours of the City Clerk’s office by the owner of the vehicle contacting the Central Dispatch and by the owner of the vehicle otherwise complying with the procedure of subsection (F) of this section relating to the release of vehicles.

(H) Notice of Unpaid Parking Citations.

(1) If, as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, a vehicle already has more than three unpaid parking citations outstanding against the license plate on the vehicle and if the vehicle is found, the City Clerk shall cause to be placed on the vehicle a notice indicating that if the owner of the vehicle does not appear at the City Clerk’s office within 10 business days and make arrangements for payment of the outstanding parking citations, the vehicle will be subject to immobilization.

(2) If the owner of a vehicle, prior to the vehicle being immobilized, appears at the City Clerk’s office and desires to make payments on outstanding parking citations, the City Clerk may accept immediate payment of 25 percent of the outstanding fines and a promissory note from the owner providing for weekly payments in the amount of $10.00 per week. If the owner fails to make a weekly payment as agreed and if there are more than three unpaid parking citations outstanding against the vehicle (license plate) the provisions of this immobilization ordinance shall apply.

(I) Notice of Procedures for Release of Vehicle. When a vehicle is immobilized the City Clerk shall cause a notice to be affixed to the vehicle advising the owner of the vehicle as to the procedures and requirements to have the immobilization devise removed and further advising the owner that if the vehicle remains immobilized for 72 hours, it will be considered an abandoned vehicle.

(v) Spalling or other forms of deterioration over 25 percent of a sidewalk section.

(5) If a sidewalk does not meet one or more of the criteria listed above, such full block face replacement petition will not be funded.

(D) Cost Sharing. It is the policy of the City to cost share with the abutting property owner when requested to replace or repair the sidewalk under the procedure outlined below. This program is subject to funding by the City Council.

(1) In the case of a spot repair, each abutting property owner desiring to have the public sidewalk traversing or bordering his property repaired shall petition in writing for a spot repair/replacement or for a full block replacement. The petition shall be signed by the person(s) requesting such repair. If there is more than one owner per lot, each such owner (or his authorized representative) shall sign such petition. The petition shall be submitted to the office of the Board of Public Works for review, classification and prioritization.

(2) In the case of a full block replacement, abutting owners of over 50 percent of the lots contiguous to the full block sidewalk replacement area shall submit a signed petition to the Board of Public Works. If there is more than one owner per lot, each such owner (or his authorized representative) shall sign such petition. The petition shall be submitted to the office of the Board of Public Works for review, classification and prioritization.

(3) Upon receipt of a petition (spot repair or full block replacement) as provided above, the Board of Public Works shall classify the petitions according to the priority levels listed above. Within each such priority level, the board shall then prioritize the priority levels according to the following priorities:

(a) Priority 1. Streets within two blocks of a school, church, publicly owned building or facility, or government office;

(b) Priority 2. Streets with over 10,000 average annual daily traffic count;

(c) Priority 3. Streets with 10,000 or less, but 5,000 or more average annual daily traffic count.

Within the priority level classifications, Priority 1 shall be done first and then Priority 2 next and so forth, providing the necessary procedures are completed.

(4) Payment by Abutting Property Owner.

(a) The City shall use the Barrett Law process (IC 36-9-37 or 36-9-38) to finance the abutting property owner’s share of the sidewalk costs. For purposes of illustration, assume the full cost of the repair is $700.00. On a 50 percent/50 percent basis, the abutting property owner would be responsible for $350.00. Under the Barrett Law, the abutting property owner would have a number of options to make the $350.00 payment:

(i) The abutting property owner could pay a lump sum payment of $350.00;

(ii) The abutting property owner could choose to pay over a 10-year period in equal annual installments of $35.00 per year; or

(iii) The abutting property owner could make payments for a number of years and then pay the balance off at any time.

(b) Under the Barrett Law process, the amount owed by the abutting property owner is recorded as a lien to ensure payment by any subsequent owners.

(5) Assessment. An assessment is based on the number of frontage feet as provided by the Barrett Law divided by either four or two based on the appropriate cost sharing.

(6) Under the spot repair petition process, the City may review the sidewalks in the block of the proposed spot repair, and do one of the following:

(a) Decline to make such sidewalk repair; or

(b) Request that a petition be circulated to all abutting property owners abutting the full block face for sidewalk replacement. If 50 percent or less of the abutting property owners request a full block sidewalk replacement, the City may decline to make such sidewalk spot repair.

(7) If utility obstructions including, but not limited to, poles, meters, or sign posts are placed in the sidewalk, it shall be the responsibility and cost of said utility to assure that the sidewalk width around the obstruction is ADA-compliant. The design approval of the solution shall be approved by the Board of Public Works.

(8) For corner lots which have sidewalks to be replaced on more than one boundary line of the lot, the following shall apply:

(a) The abutting property owner will be responsible at the appropriate cost sharing level for the first sidewalk boundary that has a full block face sidewalk replacement. The City will have full financial responsibility for the other side of the lot for full block sidewalk replacement; and

(b) The abutting property owner will be responsible at the appropriate cost sharing level for any sidewalk spot repair on the lot.

(9) Property Tax Exemption. If the abutting property owner has either a valid over 65 property tax exemption or a blind or disabled property tax exemption with the Vanderburgh County Auditor, such abutting property owner has the following payment options:

(a) The abutting property owner may pay the amount owed in full;

(b) The abutting property owner may elect to pay over a 10-year period in equal installments on the property assessment billing; or

(c) The City may place a lien on the property for the full amount which will be due and payable either upon transfer to another person or if the exemption is revoked.

(10) Driveway Curb Cut. If an abutting property owner has an approved curb cut and the owner desires to redo the driveway or the abutting property owner desires to extend the walkway between the sidewalk and the curb, the abutting property owner shall be fully responsible for such improvements and must obtain all necessary approvals as provided under this municipal code. However, the costs of such improvements will be added on to the sidewalk billing and may be paid in the same manner as the sidewalk billing. The City will not share in the cost of such improvement.

(2) Such application shall describe in detail the action applicant desires to undertake and have attached thereto a drawing showing in detail the action to be undertaken. The drawing shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such by the State of Indiana. The licensed professional engineer shall, in writing, certify to the following:

I hereby certify that the actions proposed by the applicant will not prevent the ditch, watercourse, stream or pipe from handling a twenty-five (25) year rain event.

(3) All such action must be in compliance with drainage standards approved by the Board of Public Works, assure proper drainage of the area in question, not present a safety hazard to upstream property, downstream property, or public right-of-way, and be in compliance with all other provisions of this municipal code and State law.

(4) The Board of Public Works is hereby authorized to establish rules and regulations regarding the granting of permits and procedures to accomplish or aid the permit procedure including, but not limited to, required drawings, property descriptions and certificates by engineers. The Board of Public Works is hereby authorized to issue rules and regulations for the waiver of the requirement of certification by a licensed professional engineer.

(E) Enforcement.

(1) Whenever the City Engineer or staff of the Board of Public Works is informed that a possible violation of this section has occurred, a preliminary determination of probable cause to believe a violation has occurred shall be made by either the City Engineer or the Director of the Department of Transportation. After such determination, a written notice of such violation shall be sent by certified mail to the person believed to be responsible. The alleged violator shall have 32 days from the date of mailing to bring the property into compliance. If the violator fails to complete corrective action within said 32 days, notice shall be sent by certified mail that a violation has occurred and a fine of $200.00 has been imposed. The violator has an additional 32 days to bring the property into compliance to avoid the additional cost of having the City, by contractor or its own employees, correct the noncompliance with the costs of correction being paid by the violator. Once this fine is imposed, subsequent correction will not nullify the fine.

(2) No notice shall be required prior to imposing a fine or undertaking corrective action by the City through a contractor or through the City’s own work force if the action constituting a violation poses a substantial risk of injury or death to any person, damage to upstream or downstream property, damage to the right-of-way, or threatens the use of the public right-of-way or drainage easement. In such event, anyone authorized to issue citations may issue such citation imposing a fine of $200.00 and take the corrective action necessary to alleviate the violation, all at the cost of the person responsible for the violation. To this end, this procedure shall be treated as an emergency procedure.

(3) Any notices required by this section shall be deemed sufficient if mailed to the address where the violation has occurred. Failure to claim the certified letter, refusal to accept the certified letter or failure of the person signing the receipt to deliver it to the addressee shall not render the notice defective or invalid in any respect. Notice shall be deemed effective when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid.

(F) Fines and Penalties. Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to a fine of $200.00 plus the cost of removal and correction of any such prohibited act. Such corrective action may be done by City employees or contractors hired to do the work. In addition, the City may pursue any action permitted by this municipal code or State law. [Ord. G-98-15, passed 6-15-98. 1983 Code § 9.96.15.]

Cross-reference: Temporary use of streets during construction, EMC 15.05.240.


12.05.210 Signs in the right-of-way.

The following definitions shall apply to this section unless another meaning is clearly intended:

(A) Applicability. This section pertains to signs in the right-of-way and is not intended to diminish, replace or modify regulations on private or public property found in this title, the building code (EMC Title 15) or in the zoning code (EMC Title 18).

(B) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section unless another meaning is clearly intended:

“Curb line” shall mean the outer edge of a curb which is the furthest distance from the centerline of a street.

“First Amendment sign” means any sign promoting any cause, party, candidate, idea or concept; except it does not include advertising signs advertising any business or sale of product or service by a business.

“Garage sale” or “yard sale” shall mean the selling of used items of personal property for a length of time not to exceed three consecutive days and not more than two times in any calendar year.

“Owner” shall mean the fee owner or any person having a present possessory interest in the real estate.

“Right-of-way” shall mean any street or alley right-of-way dedicated for public use and used as a street, public sidewalk, or alley under the jurisdiction of the Board of Public Works. It shall include the entire width between the boundary lines of said street or alley.

(C) Purpose and Policy. It is the purpose of this section to outline and provide a policy and procedure for the regulation of signs attached directly or indirectly (e.g., attached to a post, tree or other apparatus) to the right-of-way of the City or located in the right-of-way. This section does not apply to signs on vehicles within the right-of-way or signs that are carried in some manner by an individual. The proliferation of signs within the right-of-way creates a blight upon the community and may distract a driver from the traffic-control signage that provides protection to drivers and pedestrians. Signage may also provide obstructions to sight distance of vehicular traffic or pedestrians. It is the further intent of this section to allow property owners to remove signage that is not authorized by the City for informational or traffic-control purposes, for aesthetic or other reasons. The provisions of this section shall not abrogate any applicable State or Federal laws or local ordinances that are more restrictive, and in such event, the strictest provisions shall apply. This section shall not apply to the right-of-way of the State of Indiana, which solely controls that property, unless the State and the City enter into an agreement for the removal of signs from State right-of-way.

(D) Prohibitions and Violations.

(1) No person shall place or maintain a sign in, on or over the area of the street between the curb lines or in any alley right-of-way in the City.

(2) No person shall place a sign in, on or over the grassy area of any boulevard.

(3) No person shall place or maintain a sign in, on, or over the grassy area between the curb and the public sidewalk.

(4) No person shall place any sign in, on, or over any public sidewalk.

(5) No person shall damage the pavement, curb, or sidewalk in the installation of any sign or place any writing or markings upon any pavement, sidewalk, curb or City-installed sign. The property owner may have the numerical address of the property placed upon the curb.

(6) No person shall place or maintain a sign in, on or over the traveled (i.e., paved) portion of a street except as provided in this municipal code.

(7) No person shall place or attach any sign to a street light pole, utility pole, tree within the right-of-way, City-installed sign, or other apparatus authorized to be in a City right-of-way.

(E) Exceptions.

(1) This section shall not prevent warning or informational signage or markings placed by utilities or other owners of authorized installations within the right-of-way.

(2) This section shall not apply to any City employee, agent, or contractor of the City undertaking work authorized by any department, board or agency of the City. Also, it shall not prevent any utility, any contractor authorized to do work in the right-of-way or any emergency service from warning the public of any construction or traffic hazard in the right-of-way.

(3) This section shall not apply to signs on vehicles or signs carried in any manner by any individual.

(4) So long as a property owner is in compliance with EMC 18.130.140, a property owner may place a temporary sign approximately six square feet in size in his yard, or if he has no yard, and the house or principal building abuts the public sidewalk, then in the grassy area between the sidewalk and the curb or street pavement, notifying the public of a garage sale or yard sale taking place on that parcel of property so long as placement of the sign does not constitute a sight distance problem for vehicular traffic. The sign may be installed the day before the yard sale and shall be removed at the conclusion of the yard sale. No off-premises yard sale or garage sale signs shall be allowed in the right-of-way.

(5) In the situation where the house or principal building abuts a public sidewalk, a person may place a temporary “For Sale,” “For Rent,” or “For Lease” sign approximately six square feet in area, in the grassy area, if any, between the curb and the sidewalk of the property during the time period said property, or a portion thereof, is for sale or lease, so long as a placement of the sign does not present a sight distance problem for vehicular traffic.

(6) In situations where the right-of-way extends into the yard of the property owner beyond the sidewalk, the property owner may place a temporary “For Sale,” “For Rent,” or “For Lease” sign in the right-of-way outside (on the house or principal building side) of the sidewalk in the yard. If there is no public sidewalk, then such sign may be placed on the house or principal building side of a curb or street pavement.

(7) First Amendment signs may be placed in the right-of-way so long as they do not lie between the outside (house or principal building side) of the public sidewalk and the paved portion of the street or in any boulevard or area mowed by the City or its contractor, and the person placing the sign has the consent of the property owner in front of whose property the sign is to be placed. Said First Amendment signs may not be placed on or over any paved portion of the street or sidewalk or on any tree, street light pole, utility pole, sign or apparatus placed or authorized by the City to be in the right-of-way. If there is no public sidewalk, then such sign may be placed on the house or principal building side of a curb or street pavement. No First Amendment sign shall be placed in any location that presents a sight distance problem for vehicular traffic.

(F) Removal of Signs. Signs found in violation of this section may be removed by the employees of the Parks Department, Board of Public Works, Levee Authority, Water and Sewer Utility, Department of Code Enforcement, Building Commissioner’s office, Area Plan Commission office, and Police Department, or utility company employees who have utilities in the right-of-way or the owner of the abutting property. Additionally, the Mayor may designate in writing such other persons to enforce the provisions of this section as the Mayor deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, members of not-for-profit organizations dedicated to the beautification of the City.

The Board of Public Works shall designate a drop-off location for the deposit of removed signs. For any signs received by the Board of Public Works, the office shall attempt to contact the owner or person whose name appears on the sign by telephone, if a telephone number is on the sign or can be determined from information on the sign; or by letter if there is no telephone number but there is an address on the sign, to inform the owner that the sign has been removed, that the sign will be disposed of in three business days if not picked up by the owner or his agent, and the times and location the sign may be reclaimed by the owner. If the owner’s address or telephone number cannot be determined from the information contained on the sign or if the sign is not picked up within three business days of notification to the owner, the sign will be presumed to be abandoned and worthless property and disposed of by the City. Any other persons removing the sign may drop it off at the designated BPW location or contact the owner as provided above. If not reclaimed by the owner or his agent within three business days, the person removing the sign may dispose of it.

As an alternative to picking up the signs, the City, abutting property owner, or other person authorized above to remove signs in violation of this section may contact the owner and notify the owner, in the same manner as provided above, of the block and street wherein a sign is located in violation of this section and state that if said sign is not removed within three business days, the sign will be disposed of as abandoned and worthless property.

(G) Penalty. Any person who places, maintains or displays a sign in violation of this section or any person who places a mark or wording on a City-installed sign or upon a sidewalk, curb or pavement in violation of this section shall be subject to a fine of $25.00 per violation. If any such City sign, sidewalk, curb or pavement must be repaired or replaced because of a violation of this section, then cost of such repair or replacement shall be added to the fine imposed in this subsection. Each day such a sign is maintained in violation of this section shall be a separate offense.

(H) For more restrictions and regulations see:

However, on all streets lying in the area bounded by Northwest Riverside Drive, Main Street, Pennsylvania Street, and Fulton Avenue, including both sides of Fulton Avenue between Riverside Avenue and Pennsylvania Street, numbering shall commence with “1” at either Riverside Avenue or Main Street, as the case may be, and not at Pennsylvania Street, and no prefix indicating direction shall be given to the names of such streets, except in the case of streets crossing Main Street or running approximately parallel with such streets, as provided in EMC 12.05.410(C). [1962 Code § 905.03; 1982 Code § 96.56; 1983 Code § 9.96.56.]


12.05.410 Direction of streets.

(A) East and West. On all streets crossing Main Street from east to west or running parallel or approximately parallel with that street, that portion of every street lying east of Main Street or the approximate line in its prolongation north or south shall, unless otherwise provided in this article, be designated by the word “east,” and that portion of every street lying west of Main Street or the approximate line of its prolongation north or south shall, unless otherwise provided in this article, be designated by the word “west,” prefixed to the names of the streets respectively. However, this section shall not apply to streets which are located entirely on one side of the baseline.

(B) North and South. On all streets crossing Division Street or Pennsylvania Street from north to south or running parallel or approximately parallel with those cross streets, that portion of every street lying north of Division Street or Pennsylvania Street or the approximate line of their prolongation east or west shall be designated by the word “north” and that portion of every such street lying south of Division Street or Pennsylvania Street or the approximate line of their prolongation east or west shall, unless otherwise provided in this article, be designated by the word “south,” prefixed to the names of the streets respectively. However, this section shall not apply to streets which are located entirely on one side of the baseline.

On all streets crossing Main Street from northwest to southeast or running parallel or approximately parallel with those cross streets, that portion of every street lying northwest of Main Street shall be designated by the word “northwest,” and that portion of every street lying southeast of Main Street shall be designated by the word “southeast,” prefixed to the names of streets respectively. However, this section shall not apply to streets which are located entirely on one side of the baseline.

(D) Angle Streets. On all streets commencing at Riverside Avenue or at a street approximately parallel with it and extending northeast and then east, that portion of every street which runs east shall be designated by the word “east,” and numbering on that portion shall conform to the numbering on other east-and-west streets, as provided in this section and EMC 12.05.400 and 12.05.420. The angle in those streets shall be the point at which they receive the designation “east,” and commence a new series of numbers, except in the following cases. Numbering on Sycamore Street shall continue from Riverside Avenue to Main Street; and Mulberry Street shall change to East Mulberry Street at Eighth Street and a new series of numbers shall commence at Eighth Street.

(E) Miscellaneous Streets. Streets whose direction is neither north-and-south nor east-and-west, except streets in that portion of the City controlled as to numbering by EMC 12.05.400, shall be considered as extending in a general northerly, southerly, easterly, and westerly direction, according to which of these directions the streets most closely approximate, and buildings on the streets shall be numbered as though the streets ran due north, south, east, or west, as the case may be. [1962 Code § 905.04; 1982 Code § 96.57; 1983 Code § 9.96.57.]


12.05.420 Numbers to a block.

One hundred numbers shall be assigned to each block or square on each street so far as practicable, but this procedure may be varied by assigning 200 numbers to one block or 100 numbers to two or more blocks where necessary, on account of irregular street layout, in order to provide corresponding numbers for all blocks in a series of parallel or approximately parallel streets at their intersection with any thoroughfare which is approximately parallel with the baseline for the series of streets. In each block one number shall be assigned to every 25 feet of frontage on either side of the street, odd numbers always on the right, even numbers on the left in the direction of numbering. However, in blocks where it is impractical to use 25 feet as the frontage unit for assignment of numbers without resorting to half numbers, the Area Plan Commission of Evansville-Vanderburgh County shall have authority to reduce the frontage unit as may be necessary. Numbers assigned to any block and not needed shall not be carried on to another block but shall be dropped so that numbers may commence in the next block with the next higher 100. [Ord. G-2012-24 § 2, passed 12-12-12. 1962 Code § 905.05; 1982 Code § 96.58; 1983 Code § 9.96.58.]

In case of a break in the line of any street or in the case of a street not crossing or terminating on any of the streets serving as baselines, or its approximate prolongation, for the purpose of numbering the streets shall have the same numbers assigned as would have been assigned had the streets been straight and continuous from one of the baselines. [1962 Code § 905.06; 1982 Code § 96.59; 1983 Code § 9.96.59.]

Each number shall be placed at the center of the top riser of the steps leading to the front of the building. When this location is not practicable, the Area Plan Commission of Evansville-Vanderburgh County shall designate the proper location of the number so that the number shall be easily visible from the street. [Ord. G-2012-24 § 3, passed 12-12-12. 1962 Code § 905.07; 1982 Code § 96.60; 1983 Code § 9.96.60.]

Chapter 12.06 SPEED HUMPS

Sections:

12.06.010    Purpose.

12.06.020    Definition of speed humps.

12.06.030    Engineering criteria.

12.06.040    General conditions.

12.06.010 Purpose.

Reducing excessive speeds on residential streets to ensure the safety of neighborhood pedestrians of all ages, deaf and blind individuals, cyclists, and animals to create calmer, more livable environment. The methods of this mode of speed discouragement include education, development of an application and evaluation process, engineering concepts and prompt installation. By allowing certain installments, the police will be freed up to do other more challenging tasks. There have been many inquiries to the Evansville Traffic and Engineering Department for the rapid introduction of this traffic aid. In response to our constituents’ safety needs, the Evansville City Council has created this chapter. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.020 Definition of speed humps. 

Speed humps are three-inch (or more) high, trapezoidal in cross-section, flat topped or cylindrical raised sections of rubber, asphalt or cement. Typically, they are 12 to 22 feet long, running perpendicular to the traffic flow. Their ends are tapered at the curb gutter ends to allow rain water drainage. Due to the flat top of a speed hump, a driver does not experience the jarring that is associated with a speed bump. Thus, the vehicular rocking motion experienced at 15 to 30 miles per hour is well tolerated; it is more disruptive at higher speeds, as intended. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.030 Engineering criteria.

Speed humps will only be installed where the following conditions are met:

(A) There is a demonstrated traffic, safety or speeding problem; other measures will not address the problem.

(B) The location is a two-lane or residential street.

(C) The installation of the speed hump has been reviewed by the City Engineer or his designee. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.040 General conditions. 

The following general conditions will be considered when locating speed humps:

(A) A motorist should have adequate sight distance to react to the speed hump. 

(B) Speed humps will be placed only over clear, unencumbered paving (no manholes, etc.).

(C) A speed hump will be located downstream from a drainage inlet, where at all possible.

(D) A speed hump should be placed near existing street lighting, if possible.

(E) A speed hump will not be placed in front of a driveway.

(F) A speed hump will not be placed within an intersection.

(G) Speed humps will not be placed on designated snow routes unless the speed hump’s design is compatible with the City’s snow removal equipment. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.050 Signage. 

All speed humps shall have signage and markings in compliance with the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.060 Neighborhood support.

(A) The involved roadway segment on which the speed hump is to be placed must have neighborhood support. One vote per property owner is allowed.

(B) Fifty-five percent of the property owners within a 100-yard radius, directly impacted by the speed hump location, must approve its placement. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.070 Installation process.

(A) The initial request for installation of a speed hump must originate from a resident “applicant” of a property on the candidate street.

(B) The request must be presented in writing to the Traffic and Engineering Department of the City of Evansville with documentation of neighborhood acceptance.

(C) After receiving the request for installation, the City Engineer will evaluate it and make an appropriate recommendation to the Safety Board.

(D) In the event that an applicant’s request is denied by the Safety Board the applicant’s request may be considered by the Common Council upon the applicant’s request.

(E) If rejected a repeat application may be made in one year’s time. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]


12.06.080 Prioritization and implementation.

The City will prioritize the applications for speed humps as follows:

(A) As determined the danger by its delay.

(B) As determined thereafter on a first-come, first-served basis.

(C) The willingness of the applicant to defray part or all of the cost of installation. [Ord. G-2013-13, passed 7-30-13; Ord. G-2013-8, passed 6-12-13.]

[Ord. G-95-4, passed 5-1-95. 1983 Code § 9.95.12.]


12.10.130 Dress Plaza marine safety plan.

(A) Introduction. The Dress Plaza boat ramp, general public access, river viewing area and events plaza are all being reconstructed to repair and enhance the existing use. The Plaza provides a boarding ramp and area for participants in special events (such as Thunder on the Ohio). The Plaza will not be open to events that have not entered into a permit with the City of Evansville, State of Indiana, or with the concurrence of the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”).

(B) Purpose. The purpose of this plan is to promote the safe operation of watercraft in the proximity of Evansville’s Plaza. Procedures and systems defined in this plan are generally intended to:

(1) Encourage the safe handling of all watercraft in areas of the Ohio River that are adjacent to the Plaza. This specifically includes the section of the commercial navigation channel that extends in front of the Plaza.

(2) Prevent loitering, docking or anchoring in or near the commercial navigation channel in front of the Plaza.

(3) Encourage watercraft proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway to keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on the starboard side as is safe and practicable.

(4) Encourage watercraft of less than 20 meters in length or a sailing watercraft to not impede the passage of watercraft that can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.

(5) Encourage watercraft to not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of watercraft which can safely navigate only within that channel or fairway.

(6) Encourage watercraft to, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.

(7) Encourage watercraft crossing a river to keep out of the way of a power-driven watercraft ascending or descending the river.

(8) Manage river traffic that might be drawn to the Plaza through public information/education and enforcement.

(9) Enhance the safe passage of authorized watercraft to and from the Plaza.

(10) Define the protocol for police enforcement, and the rules and regulations that will be applied in the waters adjacent to the Plaza.

The provisions of this plan apply to all watercraft which operate within the proximity of the Plaza. This plan is not intended to conflict with Federal, State of Indiana, or City of Evansville regulations. Any apparent conflict should be resolved in favor of Federal, State, and City regulations. Although this plan is designed to promote the safe operation of watercraft in the waters adjacent to the Plaza, the owner, operator, master, or person directing the movement of the watercraft remains at all times responsible for the manner in which the watercraft is operated and maneuvered, and is responsible for the safe navigation of the watercraft under all circumstances. Compliance with these rules and procedures is at all times contingent upon the exigencies of safe navigation.

Suggestions for improvements to this plan, or requests for clarifications may be submitted to:

(C) Police Presence and Enforcement.

(1) Enforcement Agency – Mission. The Evansville Police Department (“police”) will have primary law enforcement responsibility at the Plaza and adjacent waterways, in conjunction with the Wharfmaster. The police or Wharfmaster will enforce boating regulations in the proximity of the Plaza, restrict unauthorized watercraft from operating in the Plaza, and assist in the protection of Plaza property. The police will be based at the Civic Center, which is but a few blocks from the Plaza, and this area is regularly patrolled. Agreement has been reached with the City’s Fire Department for use of its two boats should the police, who can drive to the Plaza’s water’s edge, be unable to complete enforcement from the shoreline. The City of Evansville’s Fire Department’s rescue crafts are located downtown, and upon dispatch will be available in less than five minutes to serve the police to effect enforcement on the water as needed. The Fire Department’s current boats are:

(a) A 1990 16-foot Jonboat with a 25-horsepower motor and seating for four; and

(b) A 1993 Zodiac with a 30-horsepower motor that seats four.

This police and fire team will be regularly trained in response team procedures and responsibilities in numbers adequate to provide regular coverage of the Plaza area.

(2) Location of the Police. The police will be assigned the Plaza as they regularly patrol Evansville’s downtown. All parts of the Plaza are clearly accessible and visible for police monitoring from the elevated esplanade/flood wall above.

(3) Responsibility within the Plaza. The police will be notified of all watercraft which own licenses or have been given temporary permits for docking. The Patrol will be furnished with registration, insurance, and operator information for permitted watercraft temporarily docked at the Plaza. A complete letter of agreement with the Evansville Police Department will be obtained requesting that nonpermitted watercraft docking within the Plaza be cited, and that the proposed City ordinance concerning operations within the Plaza be enforced by the police.

(4) Responsibility within the Shoreline Area of the Plaza. Docking along shoreline areas of the Plaza will be prohibited and a no-wake zone will be established for recreational watercraft in the launching area, it being understood such no-wake zone shall be inapplicable to commercial watercraft transiting the area. Operation of watercraft along the shoreline will be limited to maintenance craft, recreational boats being loaded or unloaded from the ramp, or watercraft provided with a special use permit by the City of Evansville’s Board of Public Works (e.g., watercraft with a scientific, tourism, educational or maintenance mission).

(5) Special Events. Specific plans will be developed and implemented for special events that are likely to draw increased traffic in the vicinity of the Plaza. These plans will include a sufficient number of enforcement watercraft in the water, based on the projected size of the event to reasonably assure enforcement of the plan, consistent with the City’s past practice with the “Thunder on the Ohio” event. Staffing for the police will be supplemented as necessary, to provide safety and traffic control in the waters adjacent to the Plaza, by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (“IDNR”) which pursuant to IC 35-41-1-1 has concurrent jurisdiction with the State of Kentucky. IDNR’s water patrol can be reached at (317) 232-4010.

(6) Applicable Enforcement Regulations. This plan provides details relating to the Indiana Code (“IC”) and Indiana Administrative Code (“IAC”) that establish police jurisdiction and penalties for violations of Indiana boating laws. Specific IC and IAC provisions that will be applied by law enforcement personnel in the prosecution of their duties within the waters adjacent to the Plaza are summarized. In addition to the IC and IAC that are discussed in this plan, the City of Evansville Board of Public Works (with the cooperation of Evansville’s City Attorney) and the Common Council of the City of Evansville will by City ordinance prohibit watercraft which have not secured a permit or license from docking at the Plaza, and will prohibit operators from loitering, anchoring or mooring (or beaching) their watercraft along the shoreline of the Plaza by ratifying and adopting this plan. Penalties for violations of such will, by said ratification and effective upon adoption of this plan, impose penalties comparable to those outlined for offenses listed below:

(a) Jurisdiction. Indiana Constitution Article 14, Sections 1 and 2 define the Plaza to be within the waters of the State of Indiana. The police have jurisdiction in the waters adjacent to the Plaza.

IC 8-10-5-8 provides the City of Evansville with the right to operate and control wharves and landings and, if desired, to fix and exact charges for their use and maintenance. The Plaza will be classified as such a landing.

IC 14-15-10-1 provides the police with the right to enter the waters of the State of Indiana, and provides them with the authority to make arrests and enforce boating laws.

IC 14-15-10-1 and 14-15-6-10 empower the police to issue citations requiring offenders of boating laws to appear in the Superior Court of Vanderburgh County.

(b) Penalties. The penalty for failure to operate watercraft in a reasonable and prudent manner as set forth herein shall be a Class C misdemeanor as defined by Indiana law, punishable by not more than 60 days imprisonment and a fine of not more than $500.00 as provided for in IC 14-15-12-13.

The penalty for operation of a motorboat while intoxicated as set forth herein shall be a Class A misdemeanor as defined by Indiana law, punishable by not more than one year of imprisonment and a fine of not more than $5,000.

The penalty for violation of any other regulations set forth herein shall be a Class C infraction as defined by Indiana law, punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 as provided for in IC 14-15-12-13.

(c) Registration. Except as provided by IC 9-31-3-2, every motorboat operating in the waters adjacent to the Plaza shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of IC 9-31-3-1 et seq. Such watercraft operating in the waters adjacent to the Plaza must possess a current registration certificate. In accordance with IC 9-31-3-22, the police have the right to enter upon all boats for the purpose of inspecting their registration documents. Similarly, and in accordance with this plan and the proposed City ordinance, the police may enter upon any vessel docked or moored along the shoreline of the Plaza for the purpose of inspecting the permit or license authorizing it to dock or moor along the shoreline of the Plaza. Violation of the registration, permitting, and licensing requirements shall be a Class C infraction. IC 9-31-3-24.

(d) Safety Equipment. IC 14-15-2-2 through 14-15-2-4 elaborate on equipment regulations/authority listed in IC 14-15-2-1 et seq. This plan is designed to ensure that gasoline-powered watercraft are properly equipped to reduce the potential of fires or explosions.

(e) Lighting Equipment. IC 14-15-2-10 through 14-15-2-14 define specific lighting requirements for operations during the hours of darkness or poor visibility.

(f) Life Preservers. IC 14-15-2-6 defines specific requirements for the type and quantity of personal flotation devices (also prescribed by the USCG), generally required to be on board watercraft by IC 14-15-2-6.

(g) Overloaded Watercraft. IC 14-15-6-8 prohibits the overloading of watercraft beyond its safe carrying capacity, taking into consideration the weather and operating conditions, as generally identified in IC 14-15-6-8.

(h) Unsafe Operating Conditions. IC 14-15-10-1 and 14-15-3-5 allow the police to take steps to correct an unsafe condition on watercraft. The police have the authority to direct the operator to return to mooring and remain there until the situation creating the hazard has ended (or been corrected). IC 14-15-10-1 provides the basis for the police’s authority to enforce boating laws, and to arrest operators found violating these boating laws or other offenses against the State.

(i) Safety Standards – Negligent Operation of Watercraft. IC 14-15-3-2 and 14-15-3-3 require that all operators of watercraft do so in a careful and prudent manner, having due regard for the rights and safety of other persons, actual and potential conditions and hazards, including weather and traffic conditions.

IC 14-15-3-7 prohibits persons from operating a boat at a rate of speed greater than that which is reasonable and prudent under all attendant circumstances, and at a rate of speed greater than that speed which will safely allow the operator, in the exercise of reasonable care, to bring the vessel to a stop within the clear distance ahead.

IC 14-15-3-8 prohibits operators between the hours of sunset and sunrise from operating a boat at a speed greater than 10 miles an hour.

IC 14-15-8-8 prohibits any person from operating a boat while intoxicated, as defined by Indiana law as a person with a blood alcohol volume equivalent to or greater than one-tenth of one percent.

(j) Water Traffic – Rules of the Road. The IC furthers the objectives contained herein by setting the “rules of the road” to ensure fair, reasonable, equitable, and safe use of the State’s waters. These rules include, but are not limited to:

(i) Passing instructions (all directions) (IC 14-15-3-14).

(ii) Right-of-way instructions for all watercraft entering and exiting the Plaza (IC 14-15-3-14).

(iii) Right-of-way instructions for all watercraft approaching or departing from the shoreline area of the Plaza (IC 14-15-3-14).

(iv) Instructions not to operate in such a way or at speeds that may create a hazardous wake when approaching another vessel (IC 14-15-3-15).

(v) Instructions to operate watercraft at reasonable speeds for given situations, and to maintain complete vessel control at all times (IC 14-15-3-7).

(vi) Instructions regarding speed entering and exiting the Plaza (IC 14-15-3-17).

(vii) U.S. Department of Transportation/USCG Navigation Rules applicable to inland waters.

(D) Permitting Visiting Watercraft.

(1) General Requirements. Temporary permits will be issued to watercraft docking at the Plaza for special events, such as “Thunder on the Ohio,” and to participants in special events such as regattas (“visiting watercraft”). Such operators wishing to so utilize the Plaza facility must obtain a permit from the Board of Public Works. Commercial watercraft applying for a permit must meet all Federal and State licensing and the City of Evansville’s insurance requirements. Such operators must state in their application that they will not impede the navigation channel, the route of the M/V City of Evansville or recreational boaters in the area. Such noncommercial watercraft must be operated by personnel who have completed an approved boat safety operations course, conducted by the USCG Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadron, State agency, or a recognized educational institution. All visiting watercraft must be adequately equipped to meet Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

(2) Information Requirements. All temporary permit applicants for visiting watercraft must obtain a permit from the Board of Public Works. The application will at a minimum include:

(a) Vessel identifier, registration or licensure information.

(b) Vessel identification information and a complete description of the visiting watercraft.

(c) Explanation/description of the purpose of the visit, and the duration of stay.

(d) Watercraft operator insurance information (for applicants requesting visits exceeding 72 hours).

(e) Operator licensure information (or qualifications of noncommercial operators).

(f) Radio equipment capability of the visiting craft.

(g) Permittee agrees it will, along with the City, coordinate with the M/V City of Evansville as to whether said visit will affect cruises, and if so, how cruises will be adjusted so as to assure the safety of both watercraft.

(3) Right of Inspection while on Plaza Property. All visiting watercraft must submit to boarding and inspection by the police upon registration, or at any time during the permitted visit. Visiting watercraft may be required to submit to such an inspection if, in the opinion of the Board of Public Works, the apparent condition of the vessel indicates that a severe maintenance or defect condition may exist. Refusal to submit to such an inspection may be cause for termination of a permit. The inspection may include an inventory of safety equipment, or to verify permit application information.

(4) Application Procedures. Generally, applications for permits must be received by the Board of Public Works at least 30 days prior to the requested visit. Copies of applications will be furnished to the police and to the United States Coast Guard on request. Permits will not be issued for stays that exceed seven days in duration. Individuals or organizations wishing to apply for a permit may write to the Board of Public Works at the above address or may call (812) 436-4988.

(E) Condition of Watercraft Operating in the Plaza. All watercraft operating within the Plaza must be in safe mechanical and seaworthy condition. All watercraft must fully comply with Federal, State, and local regulations. All watercraft will submit to a boarding and inspection, including USCG Auxiliary Courtesy Examination.

(F) Communications. Telephone connections will be made available to the police and commercial operators, as well as marine band radio during special events. The police can be dispatched by calling 911 to report a violation hereof.

(G) Operation of the Plaza – Weather Conditions. The Plaza is designed for year-round operation when the Ohio River is ice-free, and when the river does not exceed the flood elevation of 353 feet (Ohio River Datum).

(H) On-Site Safety Systems and Equipment. Plaza lighting will be mounted so as to minimize glare and improve visibility during night operations and so as not to interfere with commercial watercraft navigating the area.

Although the Plaza will be the base of operations for the Evansville Fire Department’s boat (with integral pumping capability), the Plaza will have integral piping for fire suppression. Two-and-one-half-inch standpipes will be provided on the Plaza for fire hose connections.

(I) Signage. Signs will be posted at the Plaza warning of wake risks. The design and location of the signs will be submitted to the USCG for its approval.

(J) Public Education. In conjunction with the IDNR, the City will implement a proactive boating education and outreach effort that will include handbills and notices produced for distribution or display at participating local marinas, boat repair, ramp and fueling facilities, and at specific events designed for boaters (e.g., regattas and boat shows) prior to the opening of the Plaza. The handbills and notices will advise boaters about the Plaza’s safety plan, consistent with the diagram attached hereto as Exhibit “A,” and made a part hereof. A diagram of the Plaza’s launching and mooring area and list of boating safety practices to be employed by the recreational boater will be included in this education. Sessions for the communication of this outreach and education will be held with news coverage with enforcement officials available to answer questions further enhancing the free flow of these important public safety messages. Particular emphasis will be placed on the hazards of the shared use of the river with commercial craft, and the hazards of drinking and boating. During the boating season after opening, reminder notices (with a similar message) will be maintained at participating local marinas, marine fueling and marine repair facilities.

Prior to the opening of the Plaza, public service announcements will be requested from radio media, notifying the public of said safety rules. Notices will be placed in the Evansville Courier and Press for a week before the opening of the Plaza, and during every boating season of Plaza operation reminders will be included in all Plaza publicity for scheduled Plaza events.

(K) Insurance Requirements. Minimum insurance requirements will be established by the City’s legal or risk management departments for all watercraft that are issued licenses or temporary docking permits in the Plaza.

(L) Impact on Navigation.

(1) Detailed Description of Area. On the right bank of the Ohio River at Mile 792.2 in Evansville, Vanderburgh County, Indiana:

Latitude: 37-58-07

Longitude: 87-34-30

7.5 Minute Quad: Evansville South

(2) Routes Normally Taken by Tows Transiting the Area. Existing terminal operations and barge mooring sites on the right descending bank cause tows passing through the Evansville Bend to “favor” the inside of the turn. Meeting, passing and overtaking situations between tows are usually avoided between Miles 792 and 793.

(3) The Width of Navigable Channel Adjacent to Dress Plaza. The width of the nine-foot project depth channel through the Evansville Bend averages about 500 feet. The distance from the right descending shoreline to the preferred navigating line in the channel ranges from 500 feet to 1,500 feet, with a mean distance of 1,000 feet. Visiting watercraft that may be permitted, subject to and as provided above, including the Delta Queen Steamboat Companies – American Queen (420 feet by 90 feet), Mississippi Queen (382 feet by 75 feet) and Delta Queen (282 feet by 66 feet). Said visiting watercraft will, if permitted, subject to and as provided above, project approximately 120 feet or less into said channel.

(4) Frequency of High or Low Water and Its Impact on Navigation. Normal pool elevation of the Ohio River in Evansville is 342 feet above sea level. On average, pool elevation of the Ohio River in Evansville from December to March ranges from 349 feet above mean sea level to 356 feet above mean sea level, with an average maximum elevation of 374 feet above sea level. On average, during the rest of the year, pool elevation in Evansville ranges from 343 feet above sea level to 347 feet above sea level. See Ohio River at Evansville Elevation Duration Table for the period of October 1975 to September 1993, attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and made a part hereof.1 High water and the attendant high current velocity increase the risk of barge breakaways from fleeting areas and reduce the maneuverability of down-bound tows.

13.05.290 Schedule of tap-in and connection charges.

(A) For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:

“City sewer system” means the sanitary sewer system of the City, located both within the City limits and within that area beyond the boundaries of the City limits, over which the City and Board of Public Works have jurisdiction as to sewers.

“Connection” and “tap-in” shall be identical whether used independently or jointly and shall cover not only situations where there is an initial or first tap-in or connection into the City sewer system but also where improvements which are already connected are additions to, enlargements of, or expansions of the existing improvements.

“Improvement” means any building, structure, or physical enclosure, whether attached or unattached to real estate, and whether mobile or immobile.

“Plumbing” means any piping governed by the Indiana Plumbing Code, the sanitary sewer lateral between a building and the main, and the water service supply from the stop-box to the building.

“Warehouse” means a building used primarily for the storage of goods and merchandise and that does not involve assembly or the manufacture of goods and merchandise.

(B) There is hereby imposed a tap-in charge upon all persons who shall hereafter do either of the following:

(1) Tap-in to the sewer system which is either publicly or privately owned and which is either a part of the City sewer system or directly or indirectly or eventually extends to or flows into the City sewer system; or

(2) Add to an existing improvement a structure to which plumbing of any sort is extended. The charge shall be imposed if the existing improvement is connected or tapped into a sewer line which is either publicly or privately owned, the line is either a part of the City sewer system or directly or indirectly or eventually extends or flows into the sewer system.

The tap-in charge shall be paid to the Utility Department prior to obtaining a permit for construction on the premises. The Building Commissioner shall not issue any permit until such tap-in charge has been paid to the Utility Department.

No fee shall be charged if an addition to an existing improvement is due to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and does not involve the installation of additional fixtures or an increase in sewer usage. This exemption shall apply to all applications received after January 1, 1993.

(C) The charges shall be as follows:

(1) A residential single-family house or condominium single-family unit (excluding mobile homes, trailers, motor homes, or other similar vehicular-type construction): $1,500 each effective July 1, 2015. This fee shall be adjusted each year on July 1st beginning July 1, 2016, in the following dates and amounts:

	July 1, 2016	$1,800

	July 1, 2017	$2,000

	July 1, 2018	$2,100

(2) A residential duplex home (excluding mobile homes, trailers, motor homes, or other similar vehicular-type construction): 0.5 times the residential single-family house charge per living unit.

(3) Apartments and townhouses: 0.5 times the residential single-family house charge per unit.

(4) Hotels and motels: 0.5 times the residential single-family house charge per rental room.

(5) Hospitals and nursing homes: 0.5 times the residential single-family house charge per bed planned as of the time of connection.

(6) Mobile home, trailer, motor home, or other similar vehicular-type improvements: 1.0 times the residential single-family house.

(7) Industrial, commercial, office, professional or educational improvements or schools, and any and all other types of improvements of every kind and nature, which are not specifically listed above, shall be charged a tap-in fee based on the size of any new water meter. The charges shall be calculated using the following equivalency factors times the residential single-family house charge:

	Meter Size	Equivalency Factor

	5/8 inch meter	1.0

	3/4 inch meter	1.4

	1 inch meter	2.5

	1 1/4 inch meter	4.0

	4 inch meter	40.0

	6 inch meter	91.0

	8 inch meter	162.0

No credits shall be applied to the sewer tap fee for previous water service meter size or previous sewer tap fees paid for any new water meter or water meter size increase.

(8) Churches and improvements built by churches or church-owned property and devoted solely to church-related activities: 1.0 times the residential single-family house charge per improvement.

(9) Warehouse. The sewer tap-in fee will be based on the size of any new water meter(s) or existing water meter size change. The charges shall be calculated using the following equivalency factors times the residential single-family house charge:

	5/8 inch meter	1.0

	3/4 inch meter	1.4

	1 inch meter	2.5

	1 1/4 inch meter	4.0

	1 1/2 inch meter	5.7

	2 inch meter	10.0

	3 inch meter	23.0

	4 inch meter	40.0

	6 inch meter	91.0

	8 inch meter	162.0

	10 inch meter	253.0

	12 inch meter	365.0

No credits shall be applied to the sewer tap fee for previous water service meter size or previous sewer tap fees paid for any new water meter or water meter size increase.

(D) Tap-In Fee Exemption. The tap-in fee for any new single-family home constructed on property designated as an economic revitalization area and approved for tax abatement by City Council shall be reduced to 0.375 times the residential single-family house charge per living unit, subject also to any other exemptions or reductions allowed in this chapter. This subsection shall apply to any home for which a building permit is issued on or after February 1, 1994. Any new single-family home constructed by a not-for-profit organization exempt from income taxes under 26 USCA 501 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be exempt from the tap-in fee provided by subsection (C)(1) of this section so long as all the following apply:

(3) The house is not constructed for the use of the not-for-profit organization;

(4) The not-for-profit organization complies with all fair housing laws and does not discriminate against any potential purchaser on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, or handicap; and

All other provisions of this chapter shall apply, including, but not limited to, obtaining all necessary permits and construction standards.

(E) Any single-family house to be remodeled or relocated by a not-for-profit organization exempt from income taxes under 26 USCA 501(C) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be exempt from the tap-in fee provided by subsection (C)(1) of this section so long as all of the following apply:

(1) The house is owned by said not-for-profit organization at the time of application for the permit;

(2) The house is remodeled or relocated for sale or lease to low income persons (as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development);

(3) Such low income purchaser or tenant is not an officer, agent or employee of said not-for-profit organization;

(4) The house is not remodeled or relocated for the use of the not-for-profit organization; and

(5) Said not-for-profit organization complies with all fair housing laws and does not discriminate against any potential purchaser or tenant on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex or handicap.

All other provisions of this chapter shall apply, including, but not limited to, obtaining all necessary permits and construction standards.

(F) Any facility that is constructed by a not-for-profit organization exempt from income taxes under 26 USCA 501(C) shall be exempt from the tap-in fee provided by subsection (C) of this section so long as all of the following apply:

(1) The facility is constructed for the sole purpose of supporting youth activities.

(2) The facility is served by one water meter.

(3) The water meter installed is three-quarter inch or smaller.

(4) The facility is completely separate and detached from any other building on the property.

All other provisions of this chapter shall apply, including, but not limited to, obtaining all necessary permits and construction standards.

(G) The charges established in subsection (C) of this section shall not apply in the following instances during the period indicated:

(1) For any improvement or real estate covered by any written contract with the City, acting by and through the board, and with a private contractor, and regardless of whether amounts charged under the contract are more or less than required under subsection (C) of this section, under the following circumstances: the contract is in full force and effect and has not been satisfied; the private contractor has not fully received all recoupment to which he is entitled under the contract; and the improvement or real estate is subject to charges imposed for direct tap-in or connection to the sewer constructed under the contract, regardless of whether or not the improvement or real estate is also subject to a charge for an indirect tap-in or connection to the City sewer system. In the event that all these circumstances are satisfied, then the charges established in the contract for the direct tap-in or connection (but not any charge for any indirect tap-in or connection) shall preempt and supersede the charges established under this section.

However, if any payment to be made under such a contract would be more than enough to pay the private contractor of the contract in full, then the tap-in and connection charge shall be whichever of the following is the lesser:

(a) The total amount required to be paid under the contract without consideration of the fact that the contract is being paid in full.

(b) The amount required under subsection (C) of this section. However, in no event shall the amount required to be paid under subsection (C) of this section be less than that amount required to pay the private contract in full.

(2) In an instance where an individual privately constructs a sanitary sewer system, the Utility Board is authorized and granted authority to permit modifications or exceptions to the foregoing schedule within its sole discretion, the modifications or exceptions to depend on particular circumstances such as, but not limited to, the distance of the development from an existing sewer, the cost for the construction of a line connecting the existing sewer to the development, the ownership of the line, and the right to recoupment from the line.

(H) The charges under subsection (C) of this section shall be reduced by the amount of any charge paid to the City under any control between a private contractor and the City, acting by and through the board, for any indirect tap-in (for a lateral or an extension) to the City sewer system under the contract while the contract is in full force and effect.

(I) This section shall be subject to the following additional terms, provisions, and interpretations:

(1) In the event any real estate or improvements can reasonably be tapped into or connected to more than one sewer, the board shall determine to which sewer the tap-in shall be made.

(2) Where a tap-in charge is to serve a new improvement which replaces an old improvement, where the old improvement has been either destroyed or removed from the real estate and the old improvement was properly connected to the City sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and the construction of the new improvement upon the real estate is commenced within 60 months from the date of destruction or removal of the old improvement on the real estate, then the following shall apply:

(a) If the tap-in and connection charge for the new improvement under subsection (C) of this section would be the same or less than the tap-in and connection charge under subsection (C) of this section would have been for the old improvement if the old improvement had been made under subsection (C) of this section, then there shall be no additional tap-in charge.

(b) The schedule in subsection (C) of this section shall apply to add-ons or additions, enlargements, or changed to an existing improvement reduced by all amounts which have previously been paid for the improvements under this section, or reduced by all amounts that would have been paid under subsection (C) of this section had the original tap-in been made pursuant to this section. No reduction in amount shall be allowed if no tap-in fee has been paid. In no event shall the additional tap-in and connection charge be less than the fee provided in subsection (C)(10) of this section. There shall not be an add-on charge for single-family residential houses, residential duplex homes, service stations, car washes, or a combination of a service station and car wash, mobile homes, trailers, motor homes, or other similar-type vehicle homes so long as the add-on addition, enlargement, or change does not modify the original use category listed above. If there is no additional plumbing in the addition, enlargement, or change, no additional fee shall be charged.

(3) In the event the construction of the new improvement is after 60 months from the date of destruction or removal of the old improvement from the real estate, then this provision shall not apply and there shall be no credit whatsoever for the old improvement; the tap-in and connection charge shall be determined under this section as if there had never been any old improvement on the real estate.

(4) The schedule in subsection (C) of this section shall apply to add-ons or additions, enlargements, or changes to an existing improvement. These modifications shall be considered separate, new, and independent structures to be tapped, either directly or indirectly, to the City sewer system, and the tap-in charge shall be computed as if the modification were a separate structure. However, there shall not be an add-on charge for single-family residential houses, residential duplex homes, service stations, car washes, or a combination of a service station and a car wash, mobile homes, trailers, motor homes, or other similar vehicular-type home, so long as the add-on addition, enlargement, or change does not modify the original use category listed above.

(J) In the event any situation arises which is not contemplated or covered by the foregoing provisions and schedule, the tap-in charge shall be determined by the board. [Ord. G-2015-13, §§ 4, 5, 6, 6-10-15; Ord. G-2003-11, passed 4-7-03; Ord. G-2002-6, passed 6-17-02; Ord. G-94-3, passed 3-23-94; Ord. F-93-4, passed 3-16-93; Ord. F-93-2, passed 2-24-93; Ord.

13.05.310 Collection – Funds to be kept separate.

(A) The Water and Sewer Utility Board is authorized to make reasonable rules and regulations and to revise and amend them from time to time, as it may deem advisable to facilitate the enforcement of this article. To facilitate the collection of the sanitary service charges as herein provided, the Department of Waterworks at its discretion may show the amount of sanitary service charge on statements rendered by the Department of Waterworks to its consumers of water and users of its service irrespective of other users and consumers or the owners of the real estate, building, or premises chargeable with the sanitary service. The failure or omission to render any statement or bill shall not in any manner relieve the owner of the real estate, building, or premises of the obligation to pay any charge under this article or in any manner affect the lien therefor.

(B) All charges for sanitary service as provided in this article shall be paid as they become due at the office of the Department of Waterworks, and all collections shall be and constitute a separate and distinct fund from other funds of the Department of Waterworks and shall not be merged or commingled therewith. The collections and receipts shall be applied in the manner required by ordinances authorizing outstanding bonds payable from revenues of sanitary service. The Water and Sewer Utility Board shall have the control and management of sanitary service and is charged with the operation, repair, and maintenance of the sanitary service system. The Department of Waterworks shall be reimbursed for its reasonable charges and expenses incurred in the collection of sanitary service charges. [Ord. G-96-18, passed 11-11-96; Ord.

13.10.010 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:

“Building sewer” or “house sewer” means the pipe which receives the discharge from any plumbing fixture located inside the building or house, and extending from the building or house to the place of disposal.

“Combined sewer” means a sewer receiving both surface water runoff and sewage.

“Health Department” means the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Health Department.

“Health Officer” means the Health Officer for the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Health Department or his duly authorized representative.

“Industrial waste” means any industrial liquid wastewater, garbage, or toxic substance from any industrial process.

“Master plumber” means a master plumber who is duly registered in the City.

“Private sewage disposal system” means any sewage disposal system not constructed, installed, maintained, operated, and owned by a municipality or a taxing district established for that purpose.

“Public sewer” means any sewer constructed, installed, maintained, operated, and owned by a municipality or a taxing district established for that purpose. A sewer installed for the purpose of carrying surface water runoff and subsoil drainage shall not be considered a “public sewer” under this definition.

“Sanitary sewer” means a sewer which carries sewage, and to which storm, surface, and ground waters are not intentionally admitted.

“Sewage” means any combination of industrial waste or human excrement, such as wastewater from water closets, laundries, sinks, bathing facilities, and other objectionable wastewaters.

“Sewage disposal system” means any arrangement of devices and structures used for receiving, treating, and disposing of sewage.

“Sewer” means a pipe or conduit for carrying sewage.

“Storm water” means any water resulting from precipitation mixed with the accumulation of dirt, soil, and other precipitation falls or flows. [Ord. G-64-8, passed 7-6-64. 1962 Code § 1731.01; 1982 Code § 51.01; 1983 Code § 5.51.01.]


13.10.020 Permit required.

A private sewage disposal permit must be issued to the master plumber representing the owner by the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Health Department before a building permit can be obtained from the Building Commissioner or his office for the construction of any residential or business building requiring a private sewage disposal system. In addition, it is necessary that a private sewage disposal permit be issued by the Health Department to the master plumber representing the owner before the commencement of construction or repair of a private sewage disposal system. [Ord. G-64-8, passed 7-6-64. 1962 Code § 1731.02(a); 1982 Code § 51.02; 1983 Code § 5.51.02.]


13.10.030 Permit application – Soil percolation test.

(A) The application for a private sewage disposal permit shall be made by a master plumber who is duly registered in the City. In addition, it shall be made on a form provided by the Health Department, which shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, and other information deemed necessary by the Health Officer.

(B) Before the application can be received by the Health Officer, it will be necessary to have a soil percolation test conducted on the ground which will be used by the private sewage disposal device. This includes both the surface of the ground and the ground below the surface to the depth of the proposed system. The soil percolation method to be employed is outlined in detail in subsection (C) of this section. Should the contour of the original ground be changed in depth to a degree that would render the original percolation test useless, it will then be mandatory to obtain another percolation test on the changed ground, and, with this new percolation result, determine the size of the system necessary. Retesting of the same areas of lots which have failed the original percolation test will be at a frequency of not less than three-month intervals.

(C) The absorbing ability of the soil is estimated by performing a percolation test on the soil in the area to be used. All of the design factors are correlated and presented in Table I below, which may be used to determine the total horizontal area to be provided in the bottom of the distribution trenches. A percolation test shall be done as follows:

(1) Two tests shall be made in separate test holes spaced uniformly over the proposed site.

(2) Dig or bore the holes with horizontal dimensions of from six to 12 inches and vertical sides to the depth of the bottom of the proposed distribution trench with a minimum of 30 inches. Holes can be bored with a six-inch diameter post-hole auger.

(3) Roughen or scratch the bottom and sides of the holes to provide a natural surface. Remove all loose material from the hole. Place about two inches of coarse sand or fine gravel in the hole to prevent bottom scouring.

(4) Fill the hole with clear water to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the gravel. By refilling if necessary, or by supplying a surplus reservoir of water with an automatic siphon, keep water in the hole for at least four hours, and preferably overnight. In sandy soils containing little or no clay, this saturation procedure is not necessary and the test can be made after the water from one filling has seeped away. (See subsection (C)(5)(c) of this section.)

(5) Percolation rate measurements should be made on the day following the saturation process, except in sandy soils.

(a) If water remains in the test hole after the saturation period, adjust the depth to six inches over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, measure the drop in water level over a 60-minute period.

(b) If no water remains in the hole after the saturation period, add clear water to a depth of about six inches over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, measure the height of the water surface at approximately 60-minute intervals over a four-hour period, refilling the hole to a depth of six inches as necessary. The drop which occurs during the final 60-minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate.

(c) In sandy soils or other soils in which the first six inches of water seep away in less than 60 minutes after saturation period, the time interval between measurements can be taken at 30 minutes and the test run over a period of one hour. The drop which occurs in the final 30-minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate.

TABLE I 

Absorption Area Required 

(Square Feet in Bottom of Distribution Trench per Bedroom) 

	Average Time for Water to Fall One Inch (Minutes)	Without Garbage Grinder	With Garbage Grinder

	15 to 29	205	250

	30 to 44	245	300

	45 to 60	275	330

	Over 60	Unsuitable for shallow absorption system. Investigate for seepage pit or subsurface filter arrangement.

(d) In no case should less than 300 lineal feet per residence be installed. (See EMC 13.10.150(C).)

(6) In conjunction with the percolation test, a subsoil investigation should also be made. If rock, hardpan, or any other impermeable stratum is found at a depth less than four feet, results of the percolation tests must be interpreted with caution. The case also warrants special consideration if the ground water table is less than four feet deep during any prolonged period. The water table is closest to the ground surface during late winter or early spring. [Ord. G-64-8, passed 7-6-64. 1962 Code §§ 1731.02(b), (c), 1731.12; 1982 Code § 51.03; 1983 Code § 5.51.03.]


13.10.040 Final inspection.

A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not become final until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the Health Officer. He or his agent shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction. In any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Health Officer when the work is ready for final inspection and before any underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within 48 hours, not including Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, of receipt of notice by the Health Department. In the event the inspection is not made by the Health Department within the 48-hour period, the person or corporation requesting the inspection may cover the installation without inspection. [Ord.

13.10.100 Defects.

Should any defect exist or occur in any private sewage system which would cause the sewage disposal to fail to meet the requirements of this chapter and cause an unsanitary condition, the defect shall be corrected immediately by the owner or agent of the owner, or the occupant or agent of the occupant. Failure to do so shall be a violation of this chapter. [Ord. G-64-8, passed 7-6-64. 1962 Code § 1731.09; 1982 Code § 51.10; 1983 Code § 5.51.10.]


13.10.110 Connection to combined or sanitary sewer.

Whenever an approved combined or sanitary sewer becomes available to the residential or business property served by a private sewage disposal system or privy situated within the City, a direct connection shall be made to the sewer, and any septic tanks, seepage pits, outhouses, privy pits, and similar sewage disposal devices and treatment facilities shall be abandoned and filled in a safe and sanitary manner. [Ord. G-64-8, passed 7-6-64. 1962 Code § 1731.10; 1982 Code § 51.11; 1983 Code § 5.51.11.]

G-64-8, passed 7-6-64. 1962 Code § 1731.16; 1982 Code § 51.15; 1983 Code § 5.51.15.]


13.10.160 Seepage pit requirements.

(A) The use of seepage pits is permitted with septic tanks when their use is necessary because of soil conditions or topography and when their use is acceptable to the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Health Department. The construction of seepage pits or sewage dry wells in limestone areas or in localities where wells are used as a source of individual supply is prohibited. This is to be interpreted that no seepage pit will be allowed to be constructed within 300 feet of a private water supply unless approved by the Health Department. Where seepage pits are constructed as secondary disposal units, it is necessary to provide the following:

(1) A septic tank of the size required by this chapter, and with the installation of two seepage pits connected in a series constructed as described in this chapter.

(2) All seepage pits in the series must be installed so that the sewage will overflow from the first pit into the second pit and so on, only after the first pit is entirely filled with sewage.

(3) The invert of the outlet from the pit must be at least one inch lower than the invert of the inlet tile.

(4) The pits will be connected by sealed joint bell and spigot, vitrified clay pipe which is laid on a slope of at least one-eighth-inch per lineal foot.

(B) At the discretion of the Health Department, subsection (A) of this section may be waived if the private sewage disposal system being installed includes a properly constructed sand trap as outlined herein. To fulfill this requirement, the sand trap shall be located in the private sewage disposal system between the septic tank and the seepage pit in such a manner that the outlet line from the septic tank shall connect to the inlet of the sand trap, and the outlet line from the sand trap shall connect to the inlet line of the seepage pit. Where the installation of the sand trap shall result in the waiving of subsection (A) of this section, the minimum septic tank requirements as outlined in EMC 13.10.130 shall prevail. Where the sand trap is approved for installation in a private sewage disposal system, it shall conform to the following requirements:

(1) The minimum inside dimensions shall be three feet in width, 15 feet in length and with a sand depth of 30 inches.

(2) The four sides and top of this trap shall be constructed in a manner approved by the Health Department.

(3) Each sand trap must have a top and bottom tile line. The top tile shall be located on top of the sand material and not enclosed. The bottom tile shall be located on the bottom of the trap and shall be enclosed in pea gravel.

(4) The sand used in any sand trap shall meet the same specifications as outlined in EMC 13.10.170(C).

(C) Location of seepage pits, in addition to the general provisions under subsection (A) of this section, shall be not less than the stated minimum distances from the following:

(1) Dwellings, 50 feet.

(2) Lot lines, 10 feet.

(3) Other seepage pits, 18 feet on center.

(4) Private water supply, 300 feet.

(D) Construction of all seepage pits shall conform to the following requirements:

(1) Before construction, boring results, in the presence of a Health Department representative, must disclose that a sandy soil is present.

(2) The minimum depth of a seepage pit will be 20 feet unless otherwise stated by the Health Department.

(3) The minimum bottom width of a seepage pit will be five feet in diameter and the minimum top width of a seepage pit will be six feet in diameter. In both cases this shall be interpreted as the distance between the lining material.

(4) When seepage pits are used with subsurface disposal trenches, the filter material in the trenches shall terminate at least six feet from the pit excavation, and this section of the trench shall not be excavated below the grade of the tile.

(5) Bell and spigot pipe with tight joints shall be used in connecting the tile to the pit.

(6) The lining may be brick, stone, block, or similar materials at least four inches thick, laid in cement mortar above the inlet, and dry with open vertical joints below the inlet. When necessary because of soil conditions, the annular space between the lining and the earth wall shall be filled with crushed rock or gravel. The lining of brick, stone, or similar materials must be at least six inches above the top of the inlet and laid in cement mortar. The inlets and outlets must be either ells or tees, which will direct the sewage flow downward and will prevent to a minimum sewage solids from entering the second pit.

13.20.110 Wastewater dischargers.

This chapter shall apply to all industrial users of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) which discharge directly or indirectly into the POTW’s sanitary sewer system. It shall be unlawful for industrial users to discharge pollutants to any sewer within the jurisdiction of the City, or to the wastewater treatment plant, without a permit issued by the City. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.045; 1983 Code § 5.53.045.]


13.20.120 Individual permits.

(A) Permit Requirements. All industrial users must notify the control authority of the nature and characteristics of their wastewater prior to commencing their discharge. The control authority is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose. It shall be unlawful for significant industrial users to discharge wastewater, either directly or indirectly, into the City’s sanitary sewer system without first obtaining an industrial user’s discharge permit from the control authority. Any violation of the terms and conditions of the permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. Obtaining an industrial user’s discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to obtain other permits required by Federal, State or local law. The control authority may require that other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, obtain industrial user pretreatment permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. These hauled pollutants shall be discharged at a City-designated point. Any industrial user located beyond the City limits shall submit a permit application within 90 days prior to the anticipated commencement of discharging into the sanitary sewer. Upon review and approval of such application, the control authority may enter into a contract with the user which requires the user to subject itself to and abide by this chapter, including all permitting, compliance monitoring, reporting, and enforcement provisions herein. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.046; 1983 Code § 5.53.046.]

F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.070; 1983 Code § 5.53.070.]


13.20.260 Periodic self-monitoring report for compliance.

In order to comply with this chapter, any industrial user may be required to perform the necessary sampling and analysis of its wastewater discharge. This self-monitoring requires that the following steps be taken:

(A) Provide, at the user’s own expense, a monitoring facility to allow for sampling and inspection. This facility shall be a manhole or other structure with an opening no less than 24 inches in diameter and an internal diameter of no less than 36 inches. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger’s premises, except where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger. The City may then concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles or present a safety hazard.

(B) Using the above facility, the user shall take samples at such frequencies and of the type required by the user’s wastewater discharge permit. This testing frequency shall be determined by applicable Federal and State guidelines. Further, these samples shall be tested for those pollutants specified by the permit. These analyses shall be performed using analytical methods and procedures set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136.

The control authority shall also conduct inspections, sampling and analysis at any industrial user’s facilities as deemed necessary to determine if pretreatment standards are being met. In order to perform these tasks, any industrial user shall allow the control authority to enter upon all areas of the premises for these purposes and/or to review or copy records which are kept by the user. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.071; 1983 Code § 5.53.071.]


13.20.270 Industrial filing system.

In order to ensure that the City is aware of the status of industrial users discharging to the POTW, a filing system will be developed.

This filing system will include, as required by Federal and State guidelines, all of the permitted industrial users and will be used for maintaining correspondence, baseline reports, semiannual self monitoring reports, and information developed by industrial waste personnel in visiting and sampling the industries.

Industrial users may inspect their file at any time. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.072; 1983 Code § 5.53.072.]


13.20.280 Inspection and sampling.

(A) The control authority shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

(1) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the control authority shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.

(2) The control authority shall have the right to set up on the user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.

(3) The control authority may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.

(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the control authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.

(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

(B) The inspection and sampling of the individual industries will entail the following:

(1) Randomly select an industry for investigation.

(2) Visit the plant site to verify the correctness of existing information.

(3) Locate the sampling manhole.

(4) Set up an automatic sampler or samplers along with flow measuring devices, if necessary.

(5) Label samples and transport to laboratory for analysis.

(6) If requested by the industrial user, the control authority shall provide the following:

(a) A list of all analyses to be completed.

(b) A written report of analytical results within 15 days of the sample collection if possible.

(7) Where the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis.

(C) All permitted industries are to be randomly sampled and inspected. Sampling and inspection will usually be conducted once annually; however, this frequency may be increased at the discretion of the control authority.

(D) Self-monitoring by all industries shall be determined by the control authority using applicable State and/or Federal guidelines.

(E) All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or baseline monitoring, periodic report, compliance date report or reports for industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties approved by EPA.

(F) Samples collected to satisfy reports required in EMC 13.20.320, 13.20.350, 13.20.370 and 13.20.380 must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The control authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements.

(1) Except as indicated below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.

(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in EMC 13.20.350 and 13.20.370, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum.

(4) Reports required for baseline monitoring, 90-day compliance monitoring, and industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the control authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the compliance certification. In addition, where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-2014-17 § 2, passed 7-30-14; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.073; 1983 Code § 5.53.073.]


13.20.290 Confidential information.

Information and data furnished to the control authority shall be available to the public without restriction unless the user specifically requests confidentiality. The request must be based upon the user’s ability to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the control authority, that the release of such information would divulge processes or methods of production; or composition or other nature of products entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information under applicable State law. Any effluent data can never be considered confidential and must be available to the public per 40 CFR 403.14(b). The U.S. EPA and other governmental agencies have the right to immediate and unlimited access to all information collected by the City under its pretreatment program for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report, regardless of the user’s request for confidentiality.

13.20.300 Notice of bypass.

If an industrial user knows in advance of a need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass.

An industrial user shall submit verbal notification of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written report shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written notice if the verbal report has been received within 24 hours. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96. 1983 Code § 5.53.081.]


13.20.310 Notification of changed discharge.

All industrial users shall promptly notify the control authority in advance of any substantial change or modification in plant processes or volume or character of its pollutants including the discharge of hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96. 1983 Code § 5.53.082.]


13.20.320 Periodic reports on continued compliance.

Any industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards, after the compliance date of such standard, or in the case of a new source, after commencement of discharge into the POTW, shall at least twice a year (June and December) submit to the control authority a report indicating the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period as well as the concentration and nature of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In cases where the pretreatment standards require compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or applicable permit necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. The information required in this report is specified by the pretreatment standards. Any analyses of the user’s wastewater which is in excess of the permit requirements must be included in this report.

These reports must include the following certification statement signed by an authorized or duly authorized representative:

I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

The control authority may authorize the industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards to forgo sampling of a pollutant regulated by categorical pretreatment standards if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in their discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:

(A) The control authority may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility; provided, that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.

(B) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent permit.

(C) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed and include the certification statement in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Nondetectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA-approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.

(D) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority must be included as a condition in the user’s control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three years after expiration of the waiver.

(E) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement below that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user:

Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standards for 40 CFR _______ [specify applicable national Pretreatment Standards part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ______ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1).

(F) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the user’s operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements detailed herein or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control authority and notify the control authority.

(G) This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standards. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-2013-4, passed 4-12-13; Ord. G-2012-12, passed 7-25-12; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96. 1983 Code § 5.53.083.]


13.20.330 Notice of potential problems including slug loading.

All categorical and noncategorical industrial users shall notify the POTW immediately of discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including, but not limited to, any slug loading as defined by 40 CFR 403.5(b).

(A) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.

(B) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.

(C) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call in the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(D) Significant industrial users are required to notify the control authority immediately of any changes at their facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

The control authority may also require those industries with the possibility to adversely affect POTW operations to develop a plan which addresses the minimization of that potential. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96. 1983 Code § 5.53.084.]


13.20.340 Compliance schedule reports for noncategorical industries.

(A) Any noncategorical industry which is not in compliance with the City’s ordinance limitations must develop a compliance schedule during which time the industry must meet the City’s standards. Development of a compliance schedule is required for installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The schedule should contain increments of progress (hiring engineers, starting construction, and the like) which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the operation of pretreatment equipment to meet the City’s pretreatment standards.

(B) All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the City no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule. This report must include whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reasons for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months elapse between progress reports. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.085; 1983 Code § 5.53.085.]


13.20.350 Baseline reports.

Within 180 days of the effective date of categorical pretreatment standards, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such standards, and currently discharging or scheduled to discharge to the POTW, are required to submit to the control authority a baseline monitoring report which contains the information contained in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of 40 CFR 403.12. This submittal must include a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements.

New sources and existing sources, both categorical and noncategorical, subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of 40 CFR 403.12. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of 40 CFR 403.12. This report must be submitted at least 90 days before the industrial user begins discharging to the POTW. New sources must include in this report any pretreatment methods to be used as well as production data, estimates of its anticipated flow, and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.

Where the pretreatment standards require compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or applicable permit necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.

This report must include the following certification statement signed by an authorized or duly authorized representative:

I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

13.20.360 Compliance schedule reports for categorical industries.

Whenever an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is not meeting the standards at the time of promulgation of that standard, a compliance schedule report shall be filed within 180 days after final promulgation with the pretreatment program administrator. Development of a compliance schedule is required for installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements. The schedule shall contain increments of progress (such as hiring an engineer, completing plans, commencing construction, completing construction, and the like), which correspond to specific dates for their completion. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standards.

All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the City no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule including the final date for compliance. This report must include, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply, the reasons for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event can more than nine months elapse between the progress reports. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.087; 1983 Code § 5.53.087.]


13.20.370 Compliance date report.

Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical standards, or in case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to the pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of 40 CFR 403.12.

For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, this report shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period.

This report must include the following certification statement signed by an authorized or duly authorized representative:

I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

13.20.380 Reports for industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards.

The control authority must require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Noncategorical significant industrial users must submit to the control authority no less than twice per year (June and December) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the control authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority to determine the compliance status of the user. These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user.

If an industrial user monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19.]


13.20.390 Pretreatment facilities operations.

If pretreatment or control of waste flows is required, the facilities shall be maintained in good working order and operated as efficiently as possible by the owner or operator at his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements of these rules and regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.095; 1983 Code § 5.53.095. Formerly 13.20.380.]


13.20.400 Enforcement system.

Industries found to be in violation of any pretreatment requirements will receive notice of such instances. Notification and appropriate action may be in the form of the following types based upon the enforcement response plan (ERP) the control authority has developed:

(A) Notification of Violation. Whenever the control authority finds that an industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, or a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, the control authority may serve upon said user notice of the violation. Upon receipt of this notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the control authority. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.

(B) Consent Orders. The control authority is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.

(C) Show Cause Hearing. The control authority may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to violation of this chapter or wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as notified, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.

(D) Compliance Orders. When the control authority finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge, directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be disconnected unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installment of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.

(E) Cease and Desist Orders. When the control authority finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order hereunder, the control authority may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:

(1) Comply forthwith;

(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as is needed to properly address continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.

(F) Administrative Fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter, or permits or orders issued hereunder, may at the discretion of the control authority be fined an amount not to exceed $2,500 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance occurs or continues to occur shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service charge and the control authority shall have such collection remedies as are available to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall continue to be a lien against the user’s property. Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the control authority to reconsider the fine within 10 days of being notified of the fine. When the control authority believes a request has merit, it shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user.

(G) Emergency Suspensions.

(1) The control authority may suspend the industrial user’s wastewater service and/or his permit whenever necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.

(2) Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater service and/or the discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of the user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the control authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The control authority shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed.

(3) An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement to the control authority within five days of such emergency, describing the cause of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any further occurrence.

(H) Termination of Permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the control authority. Any user who violates any of the following conditions of this chapter, or a wastewater discharge permit, or order, or any applicable State or Federal law, is subject to permit termination:

(1) Violation of permit conditions;

(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;

(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling. Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater discharge permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken.

(I) Water Supply Severance. Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, or an order or permit issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and will only recommence at the user’s expense, after ability to comply has been satisfactorily demonstrated.

(J) Judicial Remedies. If any person violates any of the provisions of this chapter or discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the control authority through legal counsel may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief.

(K) Injunctive Relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, the control authority through counsel may petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user. The control authority shall have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer service charges.

(L) Civil Penalties.

(1) Any user who has violated or continues to violate this chapter, or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the control authority who has legal authority to seek or assess civil penalties in the amount of $2,500 a day for each violation, plus actual damages incurred by the POTW. The penalties shall be assessed per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalties and damages, the control authority may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including, but not limited to, sampling and monitoring expenses, as allowed by law.

(2) The control authority shall petition the court to impose, assess and recover such sums. In determining the amount of liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained by the violation, corrective actions taken by the industrial user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires.

(M) Criminal Prosecution. Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter, shall be referred to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor for possible criminal prosecution.

(N) Publication. In order to comply with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(viii), the control authority shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of industrial users which were in significant noncompliance (SNC) with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during the previous 12 months. SNC will be any of the following:

(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standards requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);

(2) A technical review criteria (TRC) violation, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of a numeric pretreatment standards requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);

(3) Any other violation of a pretreatment standards requirement as defined in 40 CFR 403.3(l) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference, pass-through or including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;

(4) Any discharge that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

(5) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

(6) Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any reports required by this chapter;

(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance;

(8) Any other violation, which may include a violation of best management practices, which the control authority determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program.

Formerly 13.20.390.]


13.20.410 Right of appeal.

Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the City on any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a written reply within 30 days of the submission of the request. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this chapter or deals with a wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger’s request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. F-84-39, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.101; 1983 Code § 5.53.101. Formerly 13.20.400.]


13.20.420 Revocation of permit.

If the governing State or Federal regulations change, the City may revoke the permit granted. Additionally, any user who violates the following conditions of his permit or of this chapter, or of applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked. Violations subjecting a user to possible revocation of his permit include, but are not limited to, the following:

(A) Failure of a user to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge.

(B) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics.

(C) Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.

(D) Violation of conditions of the permit.

(E) Falsifying reports or tampering with samples. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.102; 1983 Code § 5.53.102. Formerly 13.20.410.]


13.20.430 Upsets.

Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter or a wastewater discharge permit issued shall inform the City wastewater treatment plant thereof within 24 hours of first awareness of the upset. An upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user and does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of this section are met. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that:

(A) An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

(B) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;

(C) The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):

(1) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(2) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;

(3) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

In any enforcement proceeding the IU seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the control authority enforcement personnel should review any claims that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final action subject to judicial review. IUs will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.

The IU shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-2013-4, passed 4-12-13; Ord. F-84-35, passed 6-25-84. 1982 Code § 53.103; 1983 Code § 5.53.103. Formerly 13.20.420.]


13.20.440 Notice of violation – Repeat sampling and reporting.

If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the control authority performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the control authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling, or if the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19.]


13.20.450 Severability.

If any provision, paragraph, word or section of this chapter is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs, words and sections shall continue to be in effect. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; Ord. G-96-9, passed 7-8-96. 1983 Code § 5.53.997. Formerly 13.20.430.]


13.20.460 Penalty.

Any discharger who is found to have violated an order of the City or who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the regulations or rules of the City, or orders of any court of competent jurisdiction, or permits issued hereunder, shall be subject to the penalties set forth in EMC 1.05.180. [Ord. G-2019-9, passed 7-10-19; 1982 Code § 53.999; 1983 Code § 5.53.999. Formerly 13.20.440.]

13.25.020 Purpose and intent.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to comply with the requirements of 327 IAC 15-13-14 through the regulation of illicit discharges to the MS4 and to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter. [Ord. G-2008-10 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 5.54.02.]


13.25.030 Applicability.

This chapter shall apply to all illicit discharges directly or indirectly entering or deposited into the MS4, unless explicitly exempted by the agency. [Ord. G-2008-10 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 5.54.03.]


13.25.040 Discharge prohibitions.

Unless approved in writing by the MS4 operator, agency, or other State or Federal entity having the authority and jurisdiction, the commencement or continuance of any direct or indirect illicit discharge or illicit connection to the MS4 is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes illicit discharges or connections made in the past, regardless of whether the discharge or connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. [Ord. G-2008-10 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 5.54.04.]


13.25.050 Accidental discharges.

In the event of any accidental discharge into the MS4, the person responsible for the discharge, or their representative, shall immediately give notice to the agency or MS4 operator. The person responsible shall take all reasonable steps necessary to minimize any adverse impact to the MS4. A written report shall be provided within five days of the time of the accidental discharge, unless this requirement is specifically waived by the agency or operator. Reporting to the agency or MS4 operator does not relieve the person responsible of any other reporting requirement by any other laws or regulations.

(A) The agency or any designated employee thereof shall be permitted to enter and inspect premises subject to regulation under this chapter as necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If security measures are in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto premises, the property owner shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access. Denial or unreasonable delays in allowing access to premises subject to regulation under this chapter is a violation of this chapter and violators will be subject to the same fines and penalties set forth herein.

(B) The agency shall have the right to mobilize and operate on any premises such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring, sampling or testing of the property’s storm water discharge. [Ord. G-2008-10 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 5.54.06.]


13.25.070 Requirement to prevent, control and reduce storm water pollutants by the use of best management practices.

The agency may establish requirements identifying BMPs for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of the MS4. The person responsible for any such activity, operation or facility shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Any person responsible for a property or premises which is or may be the source of an illicit discharge or illicit connection may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. [Ord. G-2008-10 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 5.54.07.]


13.25.080 Notice of violation and enforcement.

(A) If any person owning or occupying premises is discovered to be in violation of this chapter, the agency or MS4 operator may serve upon said person a written notice of violation (NOV) by personal service or registered or certified mail and order the correction of any such violations.

Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or contractor thereof and all direct and indirect expenses and costs thereof shall be charged to the violator. Within 15 days of the receipt of an NOV, or shorter period as may be prescribed in the NOV, the person served the NOV must submit to the agency or MS4 operator a written explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. The plan shall include specific actions to correct the violation and restore any land areas adversely affected by the violation. Submission of the plan will not affect liability and violators will be subject to the same penalties set forth herein.

(B) The agency or the MS4 operator may, without prior notice, issue an order to suspend or terminate MS4 access to stop an actual or threatened illicit discharge. If the responsible person fails to comply with an order suspending or terminating access to the MS4, the agency or the MS4 operator may take any and all measures necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 and the violator shall be liable for all direct and indirect expenses and costs in addition to the penalties set forth herein. [Ord. G-2008-10 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 5.54.08.]


13.25.090 Appeal of notice of violation.

Any person receiving a notice of violation from the agency may appeal in writing within five business days from the date of the notice of violation. The agency will hold a hearing on the appeal within 15 business days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal and the decision of the agency shall be final. [Ord.

All provisions of this chapter shall apply with equal force to public buildings and their construction, as well as to private buildings.

(B) The scope of work applicable to this chapter shall include every character of building operation, construction, alteration, or remodeling, any accessory, mechanical equipment, elevators, fire escapes, escalators, stairways, plumbing, heating, electrical equipment, drainage, or anything pertaining to or used in the construction of any building, and regulatory power with special reference to the conduct or maintenance of any class of building within the City, regardless of its use or character and with reference to public and semipublic buildings, schools, hospitals, churches, motion picture houses, theaters, assembly halls, dance halls, and similar types. Anything in or about any manufacturing plant, power house, warehouse, heating plant, storage building, garage, dye house, cleaning establishment, laundry, or any other plant used for the manufacturing, fabrication, assembly, or sale of merchandise or commercial commodities, that might endanger life or property either of the owner’s operatives or the public, shall be within the scope of the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code §§ 1303.01, 1303.10; 1982 Code § 150.001; 1983 Code § 15.150.001.]


15.05.020 Conformance to chapter required.

No wall, structure, building, or part thereof shall hereafter be constructed, nor shall the plumbing, drainage, wiring, heating, air conditioning, refrigeration, or other equipment of any building, structure, or premises, so far as provided for in this chapter, be constructed or altered except in conformity with the provisions herein provided. No building already erected, or hereafter to be built, shall be altered in any manner that would be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the raising or lowering of any building to conform with changes in the grading of any street, alley, or thoroughfare on which it is located and where the Board of Public Works or the Common Council may have ordered the changes. [1962 Code § 1303.02; 1982 Code § 150.002; 1983 Code § 15.150.002.]


15.05.030 Effect of zoning regulations.

(A) Zoning laws and ordinances and the rules and regulations of the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Area Plan Commission, insofar as they pertain to building construction, occupancy, or areas, frontage, and classification and locations of buildings, shall not be construed so as to invalidate any of the laws, rules, regulations, orders, or bulletins issued by or under the authority of the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Building Commissioner. 

(B) To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the development standards set forth in the zoning laws and ordinances, the subdivision control ordinances, and the rules and regulations of the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Area Plan Commission are hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter, and compliance with those standards shall be required for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy under this chapter.

15.05.040 Protection of public.

No building project shall proceed without the contractor or his authorized agent taking the proper precautions for the protection of life and property. Where permission is given for the storage of materials, where excavations have been made, or where anything in or about any work or construction is being undertaken, there shall be properly displayed all necessary warning signs, red lights, and danger signals. All red lights or lanterns must be lighted before sundown and kept burning throughout the night until sunrise. [1962 Code § 1303.05; 1982 Code § 150.004; 1983 Code § 15.150.004.]


15.05.050 Existing buildings.

Existing buildings may be maintained in their present condition and occupancy; however, any changes that are specifically required by this chapter, or which may become necessary for safety, shall be made when ordered by the Building Commissioner. Existing buildings which comply with the requirements of this chapter for existing buildings may be altered and repaired at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of their value without being made to comply with the requirements for new buildings, provided the occupancy is not changed and the hazard to occupants and surrounding property is not increased, in the opinion of the Building Commissioner. If a property is ordered razed by the Hearing Officer of the Department of Code Enforcement and is later modified to an order to repair, the repairs shall be in compliance with current rules for new construction. [Ord. G-98-20, passed 7-6-98. 1962 Code § 1303.08; 1982 Code § 150.005; 1983 Code § 15.150.005.]


15.05.060 Mechanical equipment, parts, and accessories.

All signs and other mechanical equipment, parts, or accessories of buildings constructed or erected in the future shall be in accordance with this chapter. All construction existing at the time this chapter is adopted may be continued in use except when, in the opinion of the Building Commissioner, it shall be found to be in a dangerous condition, in which case it shall either be removed or repaired, modified, or otherwise altered to render it safe, when so ordered by the Building Commissioner. In no case shall the requirements be more stringent than as set forth in this chapter for new constructions. [1962 Code § 1303.09; 1982 Code § 150.006; 1983 Code § 15.150.006.]


15.05.070 Existing suits and liabilities.

Nothing contained in this building code shall be construed to affect any cause of action or proceeding now pending in any court, or right acquired or liability incurred, nor any cause of action accrued or existing under any ordinance of the City which is repealed, nor shall any right or remedy of any character be lost, impaired, or affected by this building code. [1962 Code § 1303.11; 1982 Code § 150.007; 1983 Code § 15.150.007.]


15.05.080 Furnishing utilities to noninspected buildings.

No person, firm, or corporation shall supply or provide electrical service, electricity, natural gas, liquid gas, petroleum gas, water, or any other utility service for any building or structure unless and until an approved final inspection has been made by the Building Commissioner or his authorized agent. Temporary service may be supplied for urgent or necessary service during construction or alteration of any building provided the Building Commissioner or his authorized representative has made an inspection and approved the temporary service. [Ord. G-73-13, passed 6-25-73. 1962 Code § 1333; 1982 Code § 150.009; 1983 Code § 15.150.009.]


15.05.090 Unsafe buildings.

(A) Adoption of State Law. The City hereby adopts, in total, the provisions of IC 36-7-9-1 et seq. Said provisions of IC 36-7-9-1 et seq. shall be as much a part of this section and municipal code as though fully set forth herein. This section is intended to give City officials charged with enforcement of this section full authority and rights granted by IC 36-7-9-1 et seq.

(B) Definitions. As used in this section and in IC 36-7-9-1 et seq., the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:

“Enforcement authority” refers to the Chief Administrative Officer of the Department of Code Enforcement.

“Hearing authority” refers to a person or persons designated as such by the Mayor. An employee of the enforcement authority may not be designated as the hearing authority.

“Substantial property interest” means any right in real property that may be affected in a substantial way by actions authorized by this section, including a fee interest, a life estate, a future interest, a present possessory interest, or an equitable interest of a contract purchaser. The interest reflected by a deed, lease, license, mortgage, land sale contract, or lien is not a substantial property interest unless the deed, lease, license, mortgage, land sale contract, lien, or evidence of it is:

(1) Recorded in the office of the Vanderburgh County Recorder; or

(2) The subject of written information that is received by the Department of Code Enforcement and includes the name and address of the holder of the interest described.

(C) Unsafe Building and Unsafe Premises Described.

(1) For the purpose of this section, the building, structure, or any part of a building or structure that is in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property; a fire hazard; a hazard to the public health; a public nuisance; or dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance is considered an unsafe building.

(2) For the purposes of this section, an unsafe building and the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located are considered unsafe premises.

(D) Sealing an Unsafe Building. Whenever an unsafe building is required or ordered to be sealed against intrusion by unauthorized persons, the building shall have all openings secured by the use of plywood of not less than one-half inch in thickness, or material of equal or greater strength, sufficiently attached to the building or structure to cover the opening so as to prevent unauthorized entry.

Article II. Inspections


15.05.100 Condemned work or equipment.

(A) All work which requires a permit under EMC 15.05.420(A) shall be inspected by the Building Inspection Division of the Department of Code Enforcement. Work which will be covered shall be inspected prior to installing any material which would not allow a visible inspection. The contractor for the trade of the affected installation shall contact the Building Inspection Division and request an inspection prior to work being covered. Any contractor failing to request inspection and any contractor covering work before an inspection is in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties of EMC 15.05.520. If, in the opinion of the Building Commissioner, the covered work cannot otherwise be deemed safe and in compliance with applicable codes, the contractor responsible for covering work not inspected shall uncover any and all areas as directed by the Building Commissioner. The Inspector shall inspect the installation as soon as possible after receiving the request but in no case shall it be more than eight working hours from the time the call is received. If any inspection is not approved by the Inspector, the contractor may request and shall be provided by the department within eight working hours the specific code, chapter and section that has been violated. This section may be modified by the Building Commissioner under emergency conditions.

(B) Should the Inspector condemn any work or equipment as not being in accordance with the provisions of this article, notice in writing shall be given by the Inspector to the person engaged in the work within 10 days after notification thereof or within further reasonable time as may, upon request, be prescribed. The condemned work or equipment shall be altered or removed as the case may require, and the necessary changes shall be made so that all the work or equipment shall fully comply with the provisions of this article. In default thereof the person shall be liable for the penalties provided in EMC 15.05.520. Every owner, contractor, or other person engaged in the construction of the building, structure, or otherwise, covering or allowing to be covered any portion of the work or equipment, or removing any notice not to cover the work placed thereon by the Inspector, shall likewise be liable for the penalties as provided in EMC 15.05.520. [Ord. G-2012-4 § 2, passed 2-28-12; Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code § 1325.03; 1982 Code § 150.027; 1983 Code § 15.150.027.]


15.05.110 Re-inspection.

The Inspector is empowered to re-inspect all wiring, appliances, devices, fixtures, and equipment coming within the scope of this article. When the installation of any wiring, appliances, devices, fixtures, or equipment is found to be in a dangerous or unsafe condition, the person owning, using, or operating it shall be notified to make the necessary repairs or changes required to place the wiring, appliances, devices, fixtures, or equipment in a safe condition and shall have the work completed within 10 days after notification thereof or within any reasonable time as may, upon request, be prescribed. No person shall hinder or interfere with the Inspector or any Assistant Inspector in the discharge of his duties under this article. [Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code § 1325.04; 1982 Code § 150.028; 1983 Code § 15.150.028.]


15.05.120 Power to disconnect service.

Should an Inspector in the affected trade determine any work to be dangerous, unsafe, improperly installed or hazardous to occupants or the general public, he may cause the affected utility connection to be removed without prior notice. If the structure is occupied, the Inspector must attempt to notify the owner and/or the occupant by leaving notice at the structure and by telephone if possible. Inability to contact occupant or owner will not prevent disconnection of unsafe systems which are immediate threats to the safety or well-being of an occupant or the general public. No person shall reconnect the services to the structure until inspected and approved by the Department of Buildings. [Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code § 1325.05; 1982 Code § 150.029; 1983 Code § 15.150.029.]


15.05.130 Certificate of approval.

(A) The Inspector shall, upon request, issue a certificate of approval when the installation is completed and found to comply with the provisions of this article.

(B) No person shall make any connection to any wiring or equipment until approval has been given by the Inspector. The Inspector is authorized to disconnect any installation or equipment which has been connected before the approval for service has been given. He shall thereupon attach a notice which shall state that the wiring or equipment has been disconnected by the Inspector. No person shall remove the notice or reconnect the wiring or equipment before it has been approved by the Inspector. [Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code §§ 1325.06, 1325.07; 1982 Code § 150.030; 1983 Code § 15.150.030.]


15.05.140 Installation standards for mobile and manufactured homes.

(A) New home installation or used home re-installation inside parks shall have piers and anchors installed to manufacturer’s specification and utilize “over the top” or sidewall straps, if provided from the factory on the home. If manufacturer’s specifications are not available for new installation of older homes in parks, the piers shall be installed within two feet of the end of the frame beams and a maximum of eight feet on center and on each side of a four-foot-wide or more opening in an exterior or marriage wall. Ground anchors and tie-down straps shall be installed within two feet of each end of the frame beams and a maximum of 12 feet on center and utilize “over the top” or sidewall straps, if provided from the factory on the home. Provision for diagonal ties between ground anchors and the mobile home shall be made in conjunction with each vertical tie-down. All anchoring equipment shall be installed in accordance with the equipment manufacturer’s installation instructions. In no case shall installation standards be required to exceed those provided with the home by the manufacturer.

(B) Existing homes on existing lots in parks shall have ground anchors and tie-down straps within six feet of each end of frame beams and a maximum of 24 feet on center utilizing “over the top” or sidewall straps, if provided from the factory on the home. Provision for diagonal ties between ground anchors and the mobile home shall be made in conjunction with each vertical tie-down. All new anchoring equipment shall be installed in accordance with the equipment manufacturer’s installation instructions. Where homes do not have usable areas on the frame beams to attach anchors, other acceptable means shall be incorporated to provide equivalent resistance to lateral and uplift wind forces. In no case shall installation standards be required to exceed those provided with the home by the manufacturer. [1983 Code § 15.150.031.]


15.05.150 Liability as result of inspection.

This article shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating, or installing any wires, appliances, apparatus, construction, or equipment for damages to anyone injured by any defect therein. Nor shall the City or any agent thereof be held as assuming any liability by reason of inspection authorized herein or the certificate of approval issued by the Inspector. [Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code § 1325.09; 1982 Code § 150.032; 1983 Code § 15.150.032.]


15.05.160 Temporary use of electric and gas.

When electric or gas is needed prior to final inspection, the appropriate Inspector may approve temporary service. All electric and gas equipment and systems which are connected must be properly installed in a safe manner without hazard that could cause fire or injury to personnel.

Temporary approvals expire 60 days from issuance and services may then be removed if not ready for final inspection. The 60 days may be extended by the Building Commissioner, if the reason for noncompliance is due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

No structure utilizing temporary services shall be occupied without written approval of the Building Commission. [Ord. G-98-20, passed 7-6-98; Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code § 1325.10; 1982 Code § 150.033; 1983 Code § 15.150.033.]


15.05.170 Failure to correct defects, pay fees.

The failure of any person registered under the provisions of this article to correct defects and pay any additional fees that may be charged to him within 15 calendar days after notification thereof or within any further reasonable time as may, upon request, be granted, shall entitle the Building Commissioner, without further notice, to stop the issuance of permits to the registered person until the corrections have been made, inspected, and approved, or the additional fees have been paid. The Electrical Inspector shall be promptly notified upon correction of any defect, error, or deficiency. Request for further time shall be made within 15 days after notification of any defect, error, or deficiency. An extension of time may be granted only for good and sufficient reasons. No person shall perform any electrical work during the period permits are withheld. [1962 Code § 1325.17; 1982 Code § 150.039; 1983 Code § 15.150.039.]

Article III. Electric Wires, Equipment, or Devices


15.05.180 Partial or working permits.

When the exact amount of work to be done under any permit cannot be definitely determined at the time application for the permit is made, the Building Commissioner may issue a partial or working permit. [Ord. G-73-16, passed 6-25-73. 1962 Code § 1325.19; 1982 Code § 150.040; 1983 Code § 15.150.040.]


15.05.190 Plans and specifications.

Every person making application for any permit to do electrical work under the provisions of this article may be required by the Building Commissioner to file a set of plans and specifications in sufficient detail to enable the Inspectors to determine if the work will be in compliance with the rules, regulations, and provisions hereof. A key to the symbols used shall accompany all plans. If mains, feeder, branches, and distributing panels are shown on the plans, they shall be designated by letters or numbers. [1962 Code § 1325.20; 1982 Code § 150.041; 1983 Code § 15.150.041.]


15.05.200 New work to conform.

All new work shall conform to the requirements of this article. When any additions or alterations are made after the date on which the ordinance codified in this article becomes effective, that portion of the installation which is extended, altered, or renewed shall be made to conform to all of the applicable requirements contained herein. When such extension, alteration or renewal is the result of fire or involves materially more than 50 percent of the system as determined by the Department of Buildings, the system shall be brought into conformance with the requirements for new installation. [Ord. G-98-20, passed 7-6-98; Ord. G-93-23, passed 12-7-93. 1962 Code § 1325.22; 1982 Code § 150.042; 1983 Code § 15.150.042.]


15.05.210 Regulations for electric wires, equipment, or devices.

(A) All electric wires, equipment, or devices shall be installed in strict conformity with the Indiana Electrical Code.

(B) The following provisions shall apply to all electrical wiring equipment installed, used, or maintained in the City, except the wiring and equipment installed by a public or private utility in the exercise of its function as a serving utility for the generation, transmission, distribution, or metering of electrical energy, in the operation of signals or the transmission of intelligence. These provisions shall not apply to Federal and State property or wiring or equipment which properly comes under the jurisdiction of the Indiana Regulatory Commission:

(1) Fustats or Type S nontamperable fuses of proper size are to be installed in lieu of standard fuses at all service switches or service fuse panels to provide circuit protection. Twenty-amp fuses are permitted only on appliance or special duty circuits or No. 12 AWG conductors are used.

(2) Where services are replaced, all old, unused service pipes, boxes, etc., shall be removed.

(3) All existing residences having service equipment rated less than the potential electrical load as computed in Article 220 of the Indiana Electrical Code (IEC) shall be upgraded to comply with the requirement of Section 230-79 of the IEC.

The notice shall be served at least 48 hours prior to the time the building is to be moved across or on any street or alley, which moving is obstructed by any wires or poles.

(B) Upon the serving of the notice on the persons whose wires or poles may be affected by the moving of the building, it shall be the duty of any persons owning or controlling any wires to raise the wires, if this will permit the passage of the building, or to cut or remove the wires or poles, so as to allow the passage and moving of the building along or across any street or alley which it will be necessary to pass along or across to reach the point of destination of the building as given in the notice. No person shall refuse to raise, if that shall be sufficient, or cut or remove the wires or poles at the places specified in the notice, after being so notified, as herein provided.

The Commissioner shall issue a certificate of occupancy allowing the use of a portion of any building, provided no violation of this chapter exists against that portion, and that the temporary use of the portion shall not endanger life or property.

(B) No building, structure, or part thereof shall be altered or converted in a manner to affect its occupancy or use for any purposes whatsoever until a certificate of occupancy has been issued. No building, structure, or part thereof shall be occupied or used for any other purpose, or in any manner other than that prescribed in the certificate of occupancy. No building, structure, or part thereof shall be burdened by any greater load, or occupied by a greater number of persons, than designated in the certificate.

(C) In the cases of all existing buildings, the Commissioner may make any orders to increase exit facilities, fire escapes, or stairways, or an order for fire protections in the way of sprinklers, hydrants, or extinguishers, or any other protection, or require any changes in sanitary equipment, arrangement of machinery, protection of elevators and shafts, or any general changes as may be a benefit to the public or occupants of the affected building. Any person affected by the Commissioner’s order may appeal the order to the Board of Appeals as provided in Section 15.150.166.

(D) No change in the manner of occupancy shall be made in any story of any building or structure, or portion thereof, tending to increase the floor loads or the number of persons to be accommodated therein until there shall have been issued by the Commissioner a certificate of occupancy covering the new use or manner of occupancy. The manner of occupancy or the purpose for which any building or structure or portion thereof is used shall not be changed, except in conformity with the requirements of this chapter as to exits and floor loads. The Commissioner, in addition to having the power to modify, alter, or change the existing conditions in any building, may upon order cause the vacation of any building or premises. These orders shall state in full the reasons for vacations and the time allowed for them. Where the conditions are urgent, the Commissioner shall cause immediate vacation of any building or premises.

(A) This chapter shall be known as the Property Maintenance Code (PMC) of Evansville, Indiana. If there is any conflict between the PMC and the building codes the building codes shall apply. If the building codes are silent as to what is required, the PMC shall control.

Existing structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be altered, repaired or removed to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required herein.

No owner, occupant or tenant of a building shall be required to alter, remediate, repair or rehabilitate a building to conform with the following provisions of the Property Maintenance Code (EMC 15.15.040, 15.15.090, 15.15.100, 15.15.120, 15.15.130, 15.15.160 through 15.15.310, and 15.15.330 through 15.15.360) if at the time a building was constructed, or later altered as permitted and inspected by the City, said building met all applicable building, fire safety and occupant safety codes in effect at the time of construction or approved alteration, and maintained to that standard, unless alteration, remediation or repair is necessary to:

(1) Maintain safety, soundness and support actual designed loads of the building as required at the time of original construction or subsequent permitted alteration;

(2) Maintain fire safety for exiting, smoke detectors, wiring and HVAC at a level required at the time of original construction or subsequent permitted alteration; or

(3) Comply with the Property Maintenance Code as it specifically regulates occupant safety features for safety glass in areas of bathtubs, showers, in and adjacent to doors and landings on stairs.

(D) Existing Remedies. The provisions in this chapter shall not be construed to abolish or impair existing remedies of the City of Evansville or its officers or agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure that is dangerous, unsafe and unsanitary.

(E) Workmanship. All repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations that are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall be executed and installed in an approved workmanlike manner.

(F) Application of Other Codes. Any repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with Chapters 5.65, 5.70, 15.05, 15.10, 15.20 and 15.25 EMC.

(G) Validity. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this code shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this code that shall continue in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions of this code are hereby declared to be severable.

(H) Saving Clause. This code shall not affect violations of any other ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, and any such violation shall be governed and shall continue to be punishable to the full extent of the law under the provisions of those ordinances, codes or regulations in effect at the time the violation was committed.

The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code; provided, that any such alternative has been approved by a code official. An alternative material or method of construction shall be approved when the code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety.

(D) Research and Investigations. Sufficient technical data shall be submitted to substantiate the proposed installation of any material or assembly. If it is determined that the evidence submitted is satisfactory proof of performance for the proposed installation, the code official shall approve such alternative subject to the requirements of this code.

Such search warrant shall be requested from a court upon the submission of any photographs obtained from public property or neighboring property, an affidavit supporting a reason to believe a violation exists of this Property Maintenance Code or the building code, and/or any other supporting evidence justifying the issuance of the search warrant in compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements. If an owner, tenant or other person in control of the property voluntarily allows entry into the property, no such warrant shall be necessary.

This chapter shall not be construed to require or authorize inspections where there is no cause to believe a violation exists.

Inspection of premises, the issuance of notices and orders and enforcement thereof shall be the responsibility of the code official so charged by the City of Evansville. Whenever inspections are necessary by any other department, the code official shall make reasonable effort to arrange for the coordination of such inspections so as to minimize the number of visits by Inspectors, and to confer with the other departments for the purpose of eliminating conflicting orders before any are issued. A department shall not, however, delay the issuance of any emergency orders.

(G) Rule-Making Authority. The Chief Administrative Officer or Building Commissioner shall have power as necessary in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules and regulations, to interpret and implement the provisions of this code to secure the intent thereof and to designate requirements applicable because of local climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving structural or fire performance requirements specifically provided for in this code or of violating accepted engineering practice involving public safety.

(H) Organization. The Chief Administrative Officer or Building Commissioner shall appoint such number of officers, technical assistants, inspectors and other employees as shall be necessary for the administration of this code and as authorized by the appointing authority. The Chief Administrative Officer or Building Commissioner is authorized to designate an employee as a deputy who shall exercise all the powers of code official during the temporary absence or disability of the code official.

(I) Restriction of Employees. An official or employee connected with the enforcement of this code shall not be engaged in, or directly or indirectly connected with, the furnishing of labor, materials or appliances for the construction, alteration or maintenance of a building, or the preparation of construction documents thereof, unless that person is the owner of the building; nor shall such officer or employee engage in any work that conflicts with official duties or with the interests of the department.

If the violation(s) have been corrected within the time frame listed in the notice, no further action will be taken and no penalties imposed. The department may, at its discretion, extend the time period needed to correct the violation if the violator has contacted the department within the time frame and is working in good faith to remedy the problem.

(2) If the violation(s) identified in the notice have not been corrected within the listed time frame, the penalties for a first violation shall be imposed. The violator will then have a minimum of 10 calendar days to pay the penalty amount and correct the violation(s) or face additional notices, and/or progressive penalties as outlined in subsection (B) of this section, and/or legal action.

(3) If, after the first notice of violation is issued, the violator refuses to pay the penalty, or correct the violation(s), the department may send additional notices and/or impose progressive penalties, and/or file a lien against the property, and/or seek legal action through an administrative hearing and/or court of law.

(4) It is not mandatory for a violator to be given notice multiple times before liens are imposed or legal action is sought. Subsequent notices of violations and penalties shall not be issued sooner than 10 calendar days from the postmarked date of the previous notice. Total penalty amounts shall not exceed $2,500 for initial notices and $7,500 for each subsequent violation occurrence. Violators may appeal notices and penalties as set forth in EMC 15.15.060(C).

(D) If a judgment is entered against a defendant in an action to enforce this Property Maintenance Code, the defendant may perform community restitution or service (as defined in IC 35-41-1-4.6) instead of paying the monetary judgment for the ordinance violation if:

(1) The defendant and the attorney for the City agree to the defendant’s performance of community restitution or service instead of the payment of a monetary judgment;

(2) The terms of the agreement described in subsection (D)(1) of this section:

(a) Include the amount of the judgment the City requests that the defendant pay under IC 34-28-5-4(e) for the ordinance violation if the defendant fails to perform the community restitution or service approved for in the agreement as approved by the court; and

(b) Are recorded in a written instrument signed by the defendant and the attorney for the City;

(3) The agreement is filed in the court where the judgment was entered; and

If a defendant fails to comply with an agreement approved by a court hereunder, the court shall require the defendant to pay up to the amount of the judgment requested in the action under IC 34-28-5-4(e) as if the defendant had not entered into an agreement hereunder. This provision is adopted under and shall be construed consistent with IC 34-28-5-1(g).

(E) In addition to any fines or penalties approved by a court, said court may order the tenant, occupant or owner, as appropriate, to make such repairs as are necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Property Maintenance Code.

(B) In cases where fastenings and anchorages are to be installed and bricked in or enclosed in a manner that the Inspector cannot easily remove the material to see the anchorage or fastenings and material used, the sign erector who has secured the permit for the erection shall advise the Building Department in writing when the anchorage will be installed and the Inspector shall be allowed to inspect it before concealment. Otherwise, the department shall be empowered to stop further construction or erection of the sign until the concealed anchorages are inspected and approved by the Inspector.

(C) If any new sign erection of any kind is found unsafe, insecure, improperly constructed, or not in accordance with approved plans or the provisions of this chapter, the bonded sign erector shall be required to make the erection safe, secure, and in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, or shall entirely remove the sign within 48 hours from the time of notification in writing to that effect by the Building Commissioner. If the notice is not complied with within the specified time, the Commissioner shall notify the sign erector’s bondsmen to remove the sign.

(D) If, upon inspection, a sign of any class is found unsafe, insecure, corroded, or subject to corrosion, so that the sign may become unsafe or insecure before the expiration of the ensuing year and unable to withstand a horizontal wind pressure of 30 pounds per square foot besides its own weight, then the owner shall be required to make the sign safe and secure by causing the necessary repairs, additions, paint, or other matters to be made or done within one week from the time of notification in writing to that effect from the Commissioner. If the notice is not complied with within the time specified, the Commissioner shall cause the sign to be removed, the expense to be assessed against the owner of the sign. It shall also be the duty of the Commissioner to order the removal of unsafe signs for which a permit and license is not required herein. The maintenance of the sign in an unsafe condition after receipt of notice to remove or repair the sign shall be a violation of this chapter.

The Indiana Legislature granted the power to local units of government (IC 36-7-4) to control land use within their jurisdictions in order to accomplish the following. [Ord. G-2011-4 § 1, passed 3-15-11; Ord. G-2006-12, passed 6-20-06. 1982 Code § 154.01; 1983 Code § 15.154.01.]


16.10.020 Statement of purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to guide development in the flood hazard areas in order to reduce the potential for loss of life and property, reduce the potential for health and safety hazards, and reduce the potential for extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief. Under the authority granted to local units of government to control land use within their jurisdiction, which includes taking into account the effects of flooding, the Evansville City Council hereby adopts the floodplain management regulations in order to accomplish the following:

(A) To prevent unwise developments from increasing flood or drainage hazards to others;

(B) To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage;

(C) To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;

(D) To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations;

(E) To maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing the potential for creating flood-blighted areas; and

(F) To make Federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the City of Evansville by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. [Ord. G-2011-4 § 1, passed 3-15-11; Ord. G-2006-12, passed 6-20-06; Ord. G-2003-22, passed 8-18-03. 1982 Code § 154.02; 1983 Code § 15.154.02.]


16.10.030 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:

“A zone” means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1 – A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below:

Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone AE and A1 – A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1 – A30.)

Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

“Accessory structure (appurtenant structure)” means a structure that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.

“Addition (to an existing structure)” means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, State, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.

“Floodproofing (dry floodproofing)” is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces.

“Floodproofing certificate” is a form used to certify compliance for nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or architect.

“Freeboard” means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.

“Fringe” is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.

“Functionally dependent facility” means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

“Hardship” (as related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Flood Advisory Committee requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.

“Map panel number” is the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)

“Market value” means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values.

“Regular program” means the phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.

“Regulatory flood” means the flood having a one percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure which are acceptable to and approved by the IDNR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in EMC 16.10.050. The “regulatory flood” is also known by the term “base flood.”

“Repetitive loss” means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event.

“Section 1316” is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted State or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of State or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means those lands within the jurisdictions of the City subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Evansville are generally identified as such on the Vanderburgh County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated March 17, 2011. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1 – A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means the first placement or permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof; including, but not limited to, buildings, walls, signs, pools, gas or liquid storage tanks, and manufactured/mobile homes. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 40 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 40 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.

“Variance” is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. “Watercourse” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.

“X zone” means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.

“Zone” means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

Zone A. See definition for “A zone.”

“Zones B, C, and X” means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.) [Ord.

16.10.050 Regulatory flood elevation.

This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.

(A) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs of the City of Evansville shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Vanderburgh County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding FIRM prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated March 17, 2011.

(B) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the remaining SFHAs of the City of Evansville delineated as an A Zone on the FIRM of Vanderburgh County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated March 17, 2011, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.

(C) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood-prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. [Ord. G-2011-4 § 1, passed 3-15-11; Ord. G-2006-12, passed 6-20-06; Ord. G-93-20, passed 9-28-93; Ord. G-90-25, passed 11-21-90. 1982 Code § 154.05; 1983 Code § 15.154.05.]


16.10.060 Required permits.

No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by State law shall commence any development without first obtaining an improvement location permit from the Area Plan Commission and a building permit from the Building Commissioner, or other local approvals as required by ordinance. No required permits shall be issued if the proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.

(A) The application for required permits as stated in this chapter shall be accompanied by the following in addition to any information required under other existing ordinances:

(1) A description of the proposed development;

(2) Location of the proposed development – sufficient to accurately locate property and structures in relation to existing roads and streams;

(3) A legal description of the property site;

(4) A site development plan showing existing and proposed structure locations and existing and proposed land grades;

(5) Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of all existing and proposed structures. Elevation should be in 1988 (NAVD 88);

(6) Elevation (in NAVD 88) to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed;

(7) Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

(B) Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location permit, a preliminary determination shall be made by the Director of the Area Plan Commission to determine if the site is located within an identified floodway or within the floodplain where the limits of the floodway have not yet been determined. If there is a question on the preliminary determination by APC, the Building Commissioner or his designated representative shall have final local authority.

(1) If the site is in an identified floodway, the applicant shall be required to forward an application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the IDNR and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.

(a) Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1, a permit from the IDNR is required prior to the issuance of local permits or approvals for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of the building. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a nonboundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of nonsubstantial additions/improvements to residences in a nonboundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)

(b) No local permits or approvals shall be issued until a permit has been issued by the IDNR granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the IDNR, local permits or approvals may be issued, provided the provisions contained in EMC 16.10.070 and 16.10.080 have been met. The local permits or approvals may not be less restrictive than the permit issued by the IDNR. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.

(2) If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Building Commissioner may issue the local building permit, provided the provisions contained in EMC 16.10.070 and 16.10.080 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the flood protection grade (FPG).

(3) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Building Commissioner shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the IDNR for review and comment.

(a) No building permit shall be issued by the Building Commissioner until either a permit for construction in the floodway or a floodplain analysis and regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade have been received from the IDNR.

(b) Once the Building Commissioner has received the proper permit or floodplain analysis and regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, an improvement location permit may be issued, providing the conditions of the improvement location permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the IDNR and the provisions contained in EMC 16.10.070 and 16.10.080 have been met.

(4) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Building Commissioner shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodway, fringe and 100-year elevation for the site. Upon receipt, the Building Commissioner may issue the local building permit, provided the provisions of this chapter have been met.

(5) Upon placement of the lowest floor, or floodproofing, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Building Commissioner a certification of the NAVD 88 elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s risk. (The Building Commissioner shall review the lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted.)

16.10.070 Preventing increased damages.

No development in the SFHAs and known flood-prone areas shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health or safety.

(A) Within the floodway identified on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or engineering analysis as provided in EMC 16.10.060(B)(4), the following standards shall apply:

(1) No development shall be allowed which, acting alone or in combination with existing or future similar works, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot; and

(2) For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the permittee shall submit a request with the approval of the Building Commissioner to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to revise the regulatory flood data.

(B) Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no 100-year flood elevation and/or floodway/fringe delineation has been provided) and with a drainage area upstream of the site greater than or equal to one square mile, the following standard shall apply: The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood elevation more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

(C) Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no floodway/fringe delineation has been provided) and with a drainage area upstream of the site less than one square mile, the following standard shall apply: The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood elevation more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

(D) Public Health Standards in All SFHAs.

(1) No development in the SFHAs shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection grade, unless such materials are stored in a floodproofed storage tank or building constructed according to the requirement of EMC 16.10.080(B).

(2) New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other aboveground openings are located above, or those which are below the base flood elevation (BFE) plus one-tenth foot are watertight, but in no case shall industrial pretreatment sampling manholes be below the base flood elevation (BFE) plus one-tenth foot.

(E) Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

(F) In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss structure,” the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.

(G) Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations.

(1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.

(2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.

(3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.

(H) In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be:

(1) Considered as minimum requirements;

(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. [Ord. G-2011-4 § 1, passed 3-15-11; Ord. G-2006-12, passed 6-20-06; Ord. G-2003-22, passed 8-18-03. 1982 Code § 154.07; 1983 Code § 15.154.07.]

The MS4 operator will employ the following procedures, and will instruct the project site inspectors and other authorized representatives of the MS4 operator to employ the following procedures with regard to assigning penalties to enforce the requirements, provisions, and regulations of this chapter:

(1) “First notice of violation” means the initial determination of a violation or group of violations at a project site. Upon ascertaining and documenting the occurrence of a first violation at a project site, the agency or MS4 operator will make a corrective recommendation to the appropriate individual or individuals responsible for correcting the violation, together with a notice that the correction must be accomplished within 10 working days after the issuance of the notice to prevent the citation of a second violation with regard to the same condition or conditions that caused the first violation. The 10 working days referenced above may be reduced when significant water quality degradation has occurred or there is a high potential for such degradation to occur if left uncorrected.

In the event a person violates this chapter by a second violation of the same nature or of a different nature at the same project site, the person responsible for the violation shall correct it within 10 days of notice of such violation, or a shorter period of time designated in the notice of violation if significant water quality degradation has occurred or there is a high potential for such degradation to occur if left uncorrected. If the person responsible does not so correct the violation within the time provided in the notice, the violator shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $750.00 per violation and the cost of correction incurred by the City to have the violation corrected by City forces or by a contractor hired by the City to undertake the necessary corrective action to bring the property into compliance.

(2) “Second notice of violation” means the determination that after the expiration of the time period for correction established in subsection (B)(1) of this section as outlined in the notification of a violation, the condition or conditions constituting a violation in the first notice of violation remain uncorrected or otherwise not compliant with the requirements, provisions, or regulations of this chapter. Upon ascertaining and documenting the occurrence of a continuing violation at a project site, the MS4 operator will issue a noncompliance citation to the appropriate individual or individuals responsible for correcting the violating condition or conditions, together with a notice that the correction must be accomplished within five calendar days from the date of the noncompliance citation or a lesser time period if there is significant water quality degradation or a high potential for such degradation to occur if left uncorrected, and the potential for personnel or a contractor employed by the City or the MS4 operator to complete work to correct the violating condition or conditions at the project site at the cost of the violator. The civil penalty for the citation of a continuing violation will be no less than $100.00 and no more than $250.00. If the penalty is not paid within 30 days, the citation will be enforced in court by any remedy allowed by law, and an action may be maintained to recover the costs of corrective measures employed by the MS4 operator in addition to the fine or penalty referred to above.

(3) “Third notice of violation” means the determination that at any time after a specified or reasonable period for the correction of a second notice of violation has elapsed, the condition or conditions constituting the violation remain uncorrected or otherwise not compliant with the requirements, provisions, or regulations of this chapter. Upon ascertaining and documenting the occurrence of a continuing violation after a third notice of violation at a project site, the MS4 operator will issue a second noncompliance citation to the appropriate individual or individuals responsible for correcting the violating condition or conditions, together with a notice that the project site is subject immediately to a stop work order issued by the Vanderburgh County Building Commissioner or other agency with the authority to stop work at the project site, and the potential for the immediate employment of personnel or a contractor by the City or the MS4 operator to complete work to correct the violating condition or conditions at the project site. The civil penalty for a continuing violation following a third notice of violation citation will be no less than $500.00 and no more than $750.00. If the civil penalty for the second noncompliance citation is paid within 30 days, the penalty will be in the amount of $500.00. If the penalty is not paid within 30 days, the citation will be enforced in court by any remedy allowed by law, and an action may be maintained to recover the costs of corrective measures employed by the MS4 operator.

(4) The City and the MS4 operator reserve the right to assign a deadline for corrective action, impose a stop work order, or work to complete corrective measures on a schedule or by a deadline accelerated or shortened comparatively to the schedule or deadline assigned in this section for correcting a violating condition if an accelerated schedule or deadline is required to protect life or property from an eminent and severe threat of loss or damage.

(5) The City and the MS4 operator may perform, or cause to be performed, such work as is necessary to accomplish corrective measures at a project site by their own work forces or by a contractor hired to perform the work.

(6) A stop work order issued pursuant to this section and chapter shall not be rescinded until all recommended corrective measures have been completed, and the City and the MS4 operator have been paid for all costs incurred.

(7) Any project site owner, individual lot operator, contractor, subcontractor, property owner, or other person or persons responsible for construction activities at a project site who violate the terms, requirements, provisions, or regulations of this chapter are liable for the costs of removal of sediment and other storm water pollutants deposited in any right-of-way, drain, storm sewer, drainage easement, or City-maintained or controlled property and any and all other corrective action required to restore the property to a condition equal to or better than the condition prior to a violation. Such costs may be pursued in court and/or filed as a lien against the property pursuant to IC 36-1-6-2, or under any other State law. [Ord. G-2008-11 § 1, passed 4-9-08. 1983 Code § 9.98(B).16.]

In the event a letter of credit is not accepted and is returned, an acceptable letter of credit must be filed with the Area Plan Commission before the plat can be recorded. All letters of credit issued must contain the following clauses: 

The liability and obligations of the issuer of this letter of credit shall be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana. In the event of any dispute or controversy arising out of this letter of credit, the issuer agrees that the forum for any cause of action filed by any party shall be the County of Vanderburgh.

(2) For minor subdivisions, within one year from the year in which primary approval was granted; however, the Area Plan Commission may extend the time for recording a plat in up to one-year increments upon written request by the subdivider prior to the plat expiration.

(I) Secondary Approval in Sections.

(1) Plats that have been granted primary approval after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title may be submitted for secondary approval in sections with the approval of the Executive Director of the Area Plan Commission and in accordance with this subsection. 

(2) Additional sections may be submitted for secondary approval without repeating primary approval if they substantially conform to the geometrics of the original primary plat.

(3) The plat may be deemed to substantially conform to the primary plat if the geometrics of the secondary plat are substantially the same layout. The removal of a right-of-way for a public street that precludes street construction or compliance with the requirements of this title and additions to the total number of lots shall result in resubmission of the plat for primary approval. The addition or removal of easements to accommodate utilities or drainage shall not constitute a substantial change in conformity unless the secondary plat removes needed off-site easements shown on the primary plat.

(4) With the recording of any section of the approved primary plat, the period for recording the secondary plat as established in subsection (H) of this section is automatically renewed for another five years as to major subdivisions and another one year as to minor subdivisions.

17.05.145 Modification and waiver of subdivision standards.

(A) Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-702, the subdivision design standards in this title pertaining to the area of lots, public way widths, curves, and the coordination of subdivision public ways with current and planned public ways, extension of water, sewer and other utility services, and any other standards related to the purposes of this chapter, may be modified or waived upon request at the sole discretion of the Area Plan Commission. The authority to grant modifications and waivers acknowledges the possibility that the purposes of this title and the public interest may also be served by an alternative proposal. However, the APC authority shall be limited such that modifications and waivers shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purposes of these regulations.

(B) The APC subdivision application shall contain a subdivision design standard modification or waiver form that must be completed and filed before or with the subdivision plat application when a waiver or modification is requested. The applicant shall state the standard requested to be modified or waived, the extent of the modification or waiver, and the reason(s) why the standard should not be applied to the site as it is in other locations. 

(C) The APC shall solicit and consider comments from the appropriate local government agency(ies) in evaluating a modification or waiver request. Modifications and waivers of subdivision design standards do not constitute modification or waiver of any requirements in other local, State or Federal laws, or standards of the agencies charged with enforcing those laws.

(D) In addition, no modification or waiver request shall be granted except on a finding that each of the following factors is true: 

(1) The waiver or modification will not be injurious to the public health, safety or general welfare;

(2) The land use or value of the area adjacent to the property involved in the waiver will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;

(3) The strict application of the subdivision code standard at issue will result in practical difficulties in the use of the site;

(4) The site is not within a PUD, and the standard in question is not already subject to modification or waiver under a different section of the subdivision code;

(5) The need for the modification or waiver is due to special site characteristics or circumstances not generally applicable to other property;

(6) The modification or waiver will not undermine compliance with other applicable local, State or Federal laws, and if it pertains to the provision of public ways, public facilities, or private sewage disposal systems, there are no objections from a public agency having jurisdiction over such laws;

(7) The requested modification or waiver will not constitute or have the practical effect of modification or waiver of any standards prescribed in the zoning ordinance.

(E) As a condition of granting a subdivision standard modification or waiver, the Area Plan Commission may allow or require a commitment to be made by the property owner binding the owner, their heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns concerning the use or development of that parcel pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1015.

(F) The APC shall consider the comments of the Subdivision Review Committee, and shall approve or deny a modification or waiver request before considering the accompanying proposed subdivision plat, and shall notify the applicant in writing of its decision and any conditions of approval imposed. The decision of the APC on a modification or waiver is final. [Ord. G-2013-9, passed 6-26-13.]

(i) This requirement must only be waived or modified in a manner consistent with the purposes of this title, and any such action must be accompanied by approval of a plan showing proposed sidewalks and any alternative walkways instead of, or in combination with, sidewalks.

(ii) Major subdivisions in which all lots are a minimum of one acre are eligible for waiver or modification of this requirement by the Area Plan Commission. 

(iii) For major subdivisions in which one or more building lot is less than one acre, this requirement shall only be modified pursuant to a plan that includes sidewalks and/or alternative walkways and that is approved by both the Area Plan Commission and the Board of Public Works.

(iv) For minor subdivisions, the request for waiver or modification must be submitted to the Subdivision Review Committee with the Subdivision Application as provided under EMC 17.05.050, and the Area Plan Commission may delegate authority to the committee to approve the request, with or without amendments, by affirmative vote of a majority of the committee’s membership. In the event the Subdivision Review Committee approves the waiver or modification, the approval is final and, regardless of the lot sizes in the subdivision, the request need not proceed to the Board of Public Works. In the event the Subdivision Review Committee does not approve the request or approves it with conditions unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant may submit the request to the Area Plan Commission and the Board of Public Works pursuant to the procedure in subsection (B)(2)(a)(ii) or (iii) of this section otherwise pertaining to major subdivisions.

Where there is an available sanitary sewer outlet or trunk line approved by the Water and Sewer Utilities Board, prior to the issuance of a building permit, the subdivider shall provide the subdivision with an ample sanitary sewer system connected to the approved sewer outlet or trunk lines. All new sewer systems in any area of special flood hazard need to be located and designed to avoid impairment from flooding. If there is not an available sanitary sewer outlet or trunk line, then the subdivider shall do either of the following:

(1) Install a private sewage disposal system on individual lots of a minimum lot size that is determined to be a sufficient size from a review of soil types and topography as interpreted by the Area Plan Commission from soil maps and survey information provided by the Soil Conservation Service, and by the County Health Department in accordance with the State Board of Health. A minimum of a one-acre lot is required. The plans for installation of a sanitary sewer shall be prepared by the subdivider and approved by the Water and Sewer Utilities Board. Upon completion of the sanitary sewer system installation, the plans for such system as built shall be filed with the Water and Sewer Utilities Board.

(2) If applicable, affix a certificate on the mylar stating that the purchaser shall install on the lot a private sewage disposal system all laid out in accordance with the minimum standards of the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Health Department.

The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with an adequate storm water system in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by the subdivider and approved by the Board of Public Works. Where a storm water sewer system cannot be provided due to the amount of drainage required, easements for surface drainage shall be provided in accordance with this chapter.

(F) Monuments and Markers.

(1) Monuments and markers should be constructed to the following standard or be of other approved material.

(a) Monument. Reinforced concrete or limestone, minimum size four inches by four inches by 30 inches, or a bronze marker securely imbedded in concrete which extends below the frost line.

(b) Markers. Iron pipe, minimum size 24 inches by one-half inch, three-fourths-inch-diameter preferred, or iron or steel bars of same dimensions.

(2) Monuments and markers must be so placed that the scored or marked point coincides exactly with the point of intersection of the lines being monumented. [Ord. G-2015-29, passed 10-16-15; Ord. G-2014-31, passed 12-19-14; Ord. G-83-25, passed 7-16-84. 1982 Code § 152.31; 1983 Code § 15.152.31.]


17.05.160 Roads, streets, and alleys.

(A) The road, street, and alley design shall provide direct access to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision and shall provide for continuity of arterial or collector roads and streets. The Area Plan Commission may require the extension of certain roads, streets, or alleys to the exterior boundary of the subdivision and may require the subdivider to provide a partial right-of-way along an exterior boundary line to correspond to an existing public right-of-way on adjoining lands, or for the purpose of extending arterial or collector roads.

(B) Alleys may be required in a subdivision of land designated as commercial or industrial districts. Residential alleys are not recommended.

(C) The minimum width of rights-of-way shall be 50 feet except that cul-de-sacs may utilize a 40-foot right-of-way and 80-foot diameter, or equivalent, at its terminus. The length of cul-de-sacs is limited to 1,200 linear feet unless the Area Plan Commission determines that a longer length will not be detrimental to local traffic flow. Geometric designs for the turnaround other than a circle may be used at the terminus.

(D) Rights-of-way for alleys, when required by the Area Plan Commission in a commercial or industrial district, shall have a total width of 20 feet. All others shall not be less than 12 feet.

(E) All roads and streets must conform to the thoroughfare plan.

(F) New half or partial streets are permitted only where the subdivider obtains an agreement in writing to dedicate and improve as required the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided; where essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards of these regulations; or where needed to complete existing streets. Where an existing street traverses or abuts the subdivision, the entire right-of-way required by these regulations, or as much as is possible within the subdivision, must be provided. The right-of-way must be measured from the centerline of the existing roadway.

(G) Frontage roads shall separate local traffic from the higher-speed through traffic of major transportation arteries.

(1) Frontage roads may also be required by the Area Plan Commission to be located outside the right-of-way of arterial roads and streets when the average daily traffic exceeds 8,000 vehicles on two-lane roads and 15,000 vehicles on four-lane roads and the speed limit exceeds 40 miles per hour, or when the number of curb cuts creates a traffic hazard or major flow impediment.

(2) The design of frontage roads shall be based on providing access to the property, maintaining circulation of traffic within the subdivision, and providing for parking requirements and surface drainage.

(H) Auxiliary lanes must conform to the approved urban transportation study “Access Standards Manual” or its successor.

(I) Intersections involving the junction of more than two roads or streets should be avoided. Three-way intersections may be used wherever appropriate, particularly in residential areas. Right-angle intersections must be used wherever practicable. When local roads and streets intersect arterial or collector streets, the angle of intersection of the street centerlines may not be less than 75 degrees.

(1) Intersections must be approached on all sides by near level areas. Where the grade exceeds seven percent these level areas must have a minimum length of 50 feet (measured from the intersection of the centerline) within which no grade may exceed a minimum four percent.

(2) The design of curb or edge of pavement radii shall conform to the applicable standards adopted by the Board of Public Works.

(3) Minimum sight distance at intersections should be sufficient to avoid the hazard of a collision between a vehicle starting from a stop position and the vehicle approaching the intersection from the left or right.

(J) All plans shall conform to the current design standards adopted by the Board of Public Works. The policy of the Area Plan Commission shall be to discourage the installation of private roads. Private roads which are installed shall conform to the thickness standards for streets. [Ord. G-83-25, passed 7-16-84. 1982 Code § 152.32; 1983 Code § 15.152.32.]


17.05.170 Blocks and lots.

(A) The width of blocks should be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots. Blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length unless the Area Plan Commission determines that a longer length will not be detrimental to local traffic flow.

(B) In any subdivision or part of a subdivision proposed for residential uses, the minimum width and area for lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning code.

(1) Where a sanitary sewer is not available, the subdivider shall install a lot size that is determined to be a sufficient size from a review of soil types and topography, as interpreted by the Area Plan Commission from soil maps and survey information provided by the Soil Conservation Service, and by the Evansville-Vanderburgh Health Department in accordance with the State Board of Health. A minimum one-acre lot is required.

(2) All lots shall have access onto a road, public or private.

(3) Building setback lines shall be established back of road and street right-of-way lines, at least to the extent prescribed for front yards in the zoning code.

(4) All lots must be in compliance with the thoroughfare plan. Lots shall not be designed in such a manner that there would be insufficient area remaining to build on after building setback lines and thoroughfare setback lines are established in accordance with the zoning code and the thoroughfare plan.

(5) Whenever possible, side lot lines shall be at right angles or radial to street lines.

(6) Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be discouraged except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.

(7) Easements for utility lines along the rear lot line and along the side lot line should be provided where necessary. These easements shall not be less than six feet wide on each external lot line and five feet on an internal lot line. [Ord. G-83-25, passed 7-16-84. 1982 Code § 152.33; 1983 Code § 15.152.33.]


17.05.180 Public spaces.

(1) The land to be reserved must be of suitable size, dimension, access, and general character for the proposed use.

(2) The amount of land so required for this purpose must not exceed 0.01 acres of land for each lot on the primary plat.

(3) In the case of an apartment development, however, the number of dwelling units shall be used to determine the required acreage instead of lots.

(B) Whenever the Area Plan Commission considers that any part of the proposed subdivision is needed in the interest of the City for a park, an open space, a recreational site, a school site, or other legitimate purpose, the Area Plan Commission may require that the subdivider either dedicate the area or convey the area as directed by the Area Plan Commission; provided, however, within six months after the approval of the primary plat:

(1) The subdivider of the land to be dedicated or conveyed has been paid for the full fair market value of the real estate.

(2) The subdivider of the real estate to be dedicated or conveyed has entered into a contract satisfactory to the subdivider, to be paid the fair market value of the real estate to be dedicated or conveyed.

(3) An appropriate governmental authority has instituted legal action to condemn by eminent domain the areas which are to be dedicated or conveyed. [Ord. G-83-25, passed 7-16-84. 1982 Code § 152.34; 1983 Code § 15.152.34.]

17.05.200 Flood control and drainage.

(A) A notice shall be set out on the plat to the effect that the encroachment upon a drainage easement for open channels by any permanent structures, trees, shrubs, flowers, gardens, or vegetation other than grass is prohibited. Lot grading, in-tract drainage, and street improvements should be so designed that floods having an average recurrence interval of 100 years or less will not cause inundation or damage to buildings.

(B) Storm water flows are to be carried in the street or within the street right-of-way. These should be contained within the gutter or parking lane outside of the shoulder, but within the street right-of-way or adjoining drainage easement. Design discharge that exceeds the capacity of the adopted street cross-section, or which would encroach on the traveled lanes, shall be discharged into open channels outside of the street right-of-way, or into underground storm drains. Hillside developments will require special consideration by the Area Plan Commission in the areas of lot size and slope stability, particularly where building sites have been benched into the hillside, to protect downhill areas from slides and erosion of unstable soils.

(C) The hydraulic design of the subdivision shall be such that, after accumulating all energy losses through the various drainage transmission systems within the subdivision, depths of flow in the streets shall not exceed curb heights for a five-year flood, and the depth of flow or ponding shall not exceed a level which would cause inundation of the lowest finished floor including basement. Within the subdivision, catch basins or curb inlets shall be so placed along the streets that the flow of water in the gutter will not exceed the top of curb for a five-year average recurrence interval.

(D) Earth channels constructed within the subdivision shall have side slopes of 3:1 or flatter, and a minimum bottom width of one foot. Revetment, bank stabilization, and streambed stabilization along constructed or natural channels will be required if the channel velocities are sufficient to cause bank or invert erosion.

(1) Earth channels constructed within the subdivision in those areas not revetted and having slope of less than two percent shall be seeded with a mulched mixture as determined by the Soil Conservation Service. The mixture is to be held in place with pegged burlap, liquid asphalt, or other approved methods to establish a vegetative cover. A spray-on mulch mixture may be used in lieu of straw where it is determined by staff that straw will impede storm water drainage.

(2) Earth channels having a slope of more than two percent but less than eight percent shall be sodded with a grass similar in content to seeding mixture.

(3) Earth channels having a slope greater than eight percent shall be paved or lined with rip rap.

(4) Open channels or underground storm drains or combination thereof with a contributory area greater than one square mile shall be designed and constructed for 50-year average recurrence storm flow.

(E) Underground storm drains serving only the subdivision shall have a minimum design size for an average recurrence interval of 25 years unless storm water storage systems are provided to limit runoff rate. The underground storm drain design when combined with surface water flow shall not cause inundation of basements or buildings at the 100-year flood level. Design quantities of flow shall be computed by the subdivider’s engineer according to the publication “County Storm Drainage Manual” (May 1981) or “Project for Indiana Counties,” Purdue University. Design quantities of flow for major waterways over 25 square miles in area shall be obtained from the State Department of Natural Resources, State Office Building, Indianapolis, Indiana. [Ord. G-83-25, passed 7-16-84. 1982 Code § 152.36; 1983 Code § 15.152.36.]


17.05.210 Erosion and sedimentation control.

Erosion control and sediment control plans shall be provided as required to prevent off-site damage due to sedimentation of drainage ditches, storm sewers, ponds, lakes, streets, or other property, both public and private; and to prevent erosion of adjoining land due to the change in land use or rerouting of surface water. Where lots are so large that the approximate building location cannot be determined at the time of preparation of the erosion control plan, there shall be a statement on the plat that individual site grading and erosion control plans will be required with the building permit application. [Ord. G-83-25, passed 7-16-84. 1982 Code § 152.37; 1983 Code § 15.152.37.]


17.05.220 Street sign and traffic-control sign requirements.

(A) The developer of any subdivision (“applicant”) shall provide a plan (“signage plan”) for the installation of all public safety related street signs, public safety related traffic-control signs, and street identification signs (“required signage”) to be filed along with the street plans for approval by the Board of Public Works of the City of Evansville, Indiana. Upon approval of the signage plan, the applicant must provide the required signage as set forth in subsection (B) of this section at every street intersection in accordance with the approved signage plan. The required signage shall conform to the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as to shape, color, size message, arrangement and placement unless the use of decorative street name signs is approved by the Board of Public Works of the City of Evansville, Indiana. The use of decorative signs shall require the applicant to obtain an encroachment permit from the Board of Public Works of the City of Evansville, Indiana.

(B) The following provisions shall apply to required signage:

(1) The applicant shall provide for required signage on subdivision streets as outlined below:

(a) The installation of the required signage shall occur as the first layer of asphalt or the concrete is poured for a street(s) within a subdivision or a section thereof, or within 60 days of the date the first improvement location permit is issued for a lot on a given subdivision street, whichever occurs first.

(b) The required signage shall also be installed on any other subdivision street(s) that provides access to the section of the subdivision being requested for street acceptance; or the section of the subdivision that has been recorded and in which improvement location permits have begun to be issued.

(c) The APC shall notify the City Engineer of the dates the signs are required to be installed based on the dating of issuance of the improvement location permits. If the required signage is not installed at the time the streets are paved or within 60 days following the issuance of the first improvement location permit, or is not installed properly in accordance with the approved signage plan, the City Engineer shall inform the APC and no further improvement location permits shall be issued in that subdivision until the APC is notified by the City Engineer that the required signage has been installed and approved by the City Engineer.

(d) The applicant shall submit a written request to the City Engineer for an inspection of the required signage after the installation thereof is complete.

(e) The City Engineer shall complete the inspection within 30 days of the applicant’s notification.

Upon correction of the deficiencies, the applicant shall notify the City Engineer in writing so that the required signage can be re-inspected. After all deficiencies have been corrected, the City Engineer shall notify the APC that the required signage has been installed as required and that improvement location permits can again be issued in the subdivision.

(2) The approval of the City Engineer of required signage and the installation thereof is for the purpose of ensuring public safety and such approval shall not constitute acceptance by the City of Evansville of the streets and/or other improvements within the street right-of-way.

(3) The City of Evansville shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair and/or replacement of all required signage after it has been installed and approved by the City Engineer, except where decorative signs are used, in which case the applicant and his heirs and/or assigns shall be responsible for maintenance, repair and replacement of such decorative signs.

(4) The APC Director may, upon written request by the applicant, grant an extension of time for signs to be installed. [Ord. G-2008-5, passed 2-27-08. 1983 Code § 15.152.38.]

18.10.020 Annexed areas.

All areas annexed to the City will retain the same zoning classification as before annexation, except that all areas zoned agricultural in the County before annexation will be zoned R-1 single-family residential in the City after annexation. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 2, § 2; 1982 Code § 153.006; 1983 Code § 15.153.006.]


18.10.030 Water areas.

The water surface and land under the water surface of all canals, creeks, rivers, waterways, ponds, lakes, and other water areas in the City are in the same zoning district as the land which it abuts as shown on the zoning district maps. Where the zoning districts shown on the zoning district maps are different on opposite sides of the water area, the zoning district on each side extends to the centerline or midpoint of the water area. For convenience of mapping and clarity, the zoning of water areas is not shown on the zoning district maps, but is determined by the provisions of this title. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 2, § 3; 1982 Code § 153.007; 1983 Code § 15.153.007.]


18.10.040 District boundaries.

(A) Unless otherwise shown, the district boundaries are centerlines of streets, alleys, or the subdividing or boundary lines of recorded plats or their extensions. If the districts designated on the zoning district maps are approximately bounded by street lines, alley lines, or the subdividing or boundary lines of recorded plats, those lines or their extensions are district boundaries.

(B) If, due to the scale or illegibility of the zoning district maps, or due to the absence of a street, alley, or recorded subdividing or plat lines, there is any uncertainty, contradiction, or conflict about the location of a district boundary, the Area Plan Commission shall recommend the designation to the Common Council. The Common Council shall designate the location for that district boundary in accordance with the provisions of this title.

(C) If the boundary line of a zoning district classification divides a lot, the provisions of this title covering the less restrictive portion of that lot apply to the entire lot, unless the frontage of the lot is in the more restricted district, in which case the provisions covering the more restricted portion apply to the entire lot.

(D) The provisions of subsection (C) of this section do not apply to situations where specific portions of a lot are rezoned to accommodate a different use from that use of the remainder of the lot. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 2, § 4; 1982 Code § 153.008; 1983 Code § 15.153.008.]

Chapter 18.115 ARTS OVERLAY ZONE

Sections:

18.115.010    Guidelines.

18.115.015    Location.

18.115.020    Approval criteria.


18.115.010 Guidelines.

(A) Purpose. The purpose of the arts overlay zone (“AOZ”) is to facilitate investment involving improvements to land and structures within the district, while encouraging artistic and creative uses. The AOZ overlays properties already classified into existing zoning districts. The objective is to offer more flexibility in uses allowed and development standards in the AOZ as incentives for new development. The intended result of the overlay is to help establish a mixed use area with art-related businesses, other low intensity, neighborhood-supporting businesses, live/work units and traditional residences integrated together in a manner that maintains the residential character of the area. The AOZ uses an innovative approach allowing artists and owners and operators of support businesses to occupy joint living and commercial space within the same structure that would otherwise not be allowed in many of the underlying zoning districts. The creation of the AOZ promotes investment through mixed use development that expands the presence of and/or otherwise enhances the arts within the zone.

(B) General Requirements for Mixed Use. The AOZ will function as follows:

(1) In the residential zoning districts, the commercial or nonresidential uses allowed will be limited to low-intensity commercial and arts-related uses as defined in EMC 18.115.020(C) and (D).

(2) The commercial component of the use shall generally be accessory to the residential use on residentially-zoned properties, and the residential component of the use shall be accessory to the commercial use on commercially-zoned properties.

(3) All nonresidential uses in residential zoning districts shall have a residential component unless the commercial use can meet the conditions established herein to be considered a primary use.

(4) All residential units must comply with the minimum size requirement for a dwelling in EMC 18.130.020.

(5) Commercial uses must not produce odor, fumes, dust, light, glare, noise, or other similar impacts extending beyond the property line of the lot where the live/work unit is located.

(6) All commercial uses not located in a C-4 zoning district in the AOZ shall be conducted inside enclosed structure(s), with no outside storage areas. Several examples of artwork or product may be displayed outside on a site only during hours of operation of the nonresidential use. [Ord G-2011-8 § 2, passed 5-16-11.]


18.115.015 Location.

The AOZ is established in the Haynie’s Corner area south of the Evansville central business district as shown on the arts overlay zone map included at the end of this chapter, and on the official City of Evansville zoning map. [Ord G-2011-8 § 2, passed 5-16-11.]


18.115.020 Approval criteria.

All new development and additions, expansions or modifications of existing structures within the AOZ must meet the following criteria in order to be approved:

(A) Zoning. The underlying zoning classification of the district is unchanged. Land owners desiring to improve their property have the option to proceed using the underlying district regulations or the requirements of this overlay. Live/work uses, nonresidential uses in residential zoning districts and residential uses in commercial zoning districts must be located within the AOZ boundaries. All zoning code requirements not mentioned herein as part of the AOZ are subject to the requirements of the underlying zoning classification (including the development standards in Table A in EMC 18.130.010).

(B) Subarea Boundaries. To establish a layering of land use intensity in the AOZ, the zone shall be divided into the following three distinct areas as shown on the attached arts overlay zone map:

* The residential live/work area;

* The residential transition area; and

* The commercial core area.

(1) The residential live/work area is the eastern portion of the AOZ, the residential transition area is generally the middle portion and the commercial core is the western end of the zone.

(2) The residential live/work area and the residential transition area are separated by a line extending through the AOZ as follows:

starting at a point centered on the intersection of Putnam Avenue and the alley between Adams and Jefferson Avenues; proceeding north along Putnam Avenue to the alley between Washington and Adams Avenues; east along the alley to Judson Avenue; north along Judson Avenue to Washington Avenue; west on Washington Avenue to the point where Judson Avenue resumes; and north on Judson Avenue to the northern Zone boundary.

(3) The boundary of the commercial core area follows the perimeter of the commercial zoning along SE Second and Parrett Streets as depicted on the official zoning map on the date of adoption for this section.

(C) The Residential Live/Work Area.

(1) In consideration of protecting neighborhood residential character, the following limited list of nonresidential live/work uses are permitted within the residential zoning districts in this area:

(3) The residential component of a live/work unit must contain sleeping space, cooking facilities, and complete sanitary facilities.

(4) The residential occupancy of a live/work unit must include at least one person who is employed or carries out an occupation within the nonresidential component of the unit.

(5) The nonresidential component of a live/work unit shall be limited to two employees per shift (including the person living in the unit that is associated with the business).

(D) The Residential Transition Area.

(1) The following list of nonresidential uses are permitted within the residential zoning districts in this area to allow for transition uses between the more residential (east end) and commercial (west end) portions of the zone:

(3) A permitted nonresidential use from the list in subsection (D)(1) of this section may be considered a primary permitted use in the AOZ, if the following conditions are met:

(a) The site must be located in the AOZ and within one of the following commercial extension areas shown on the attached arts overlay zone map:

(i) The area near the intersection of Washington Avenue and Eighth Street containing parcels fronting along the north side of Washington Avenue, and along the west side of Eighth Street between Powell and Washington Avenues;

(ii) The area east of Parrett/SE Second Streets (adjacent to the C-4 zoning district along Parrett/SE Second Streets as shown on the official zoning map on the date of adoption for the ordinance codified in this chapter) containing parcels between Blackford Avenue and the alley between Jefferson and Madison Avenues.

(b) If the nonresidential use involves an addition or new construction, the structure must be designed to look like a residential use.

(4) All other nonresidential uses shall comply with the underlying zoning classification limitations on use including the Table A requirements in EMC 18.130.010.

(a) Single-unit residential (upper floors only);

(b) Multifamily residential (upper floors only).

(2) Of the many commercial uses permitted in the underlying zoning for this area, the uses that are preferred and encouraged to be incorporated into the area are the commercial uses listed in subsections (C)(1) and (D)(1) of this section along with the following:

(a) Grocery store;

(b) Drug store;

(c) Convenience store;

(d) Other specialty retail;

(e) Restaurant (with outdoor seating);

(4) Required front yard building setbacks in this area are allowed to be reduced to zero providing that, at street intersections, a minimum setback may be required by the Site Review Committee to ensure adequate site distance for traffic safety.

(F) Permits. The property owner of each residence and each live/work or other nonresidential enterprise shall maintain at all times a valid improvement location permit issued by the Area Plan Commission and all other licenses and permits as may be required by law for operating a business on the premises.

(G) Special Use Approval. Artist uses within the area defined in EMC 18.115.015 which will involve excessive noise or periodic spray painting of large sculptures or other items require special use (SU-45) approval. Excessive noise in residential areas is defined as 75 decibels or greater as measured at the property line. Artist activities must comply with all federal, state and local environmental laws including the City noise regulations in Chapter 9.30 EMC.

(I) Parking.

(1) In residential zoning districts, off-street parking is not required. However, it is encouraged that owners provide at least one parking space if possible in the rear of the property off of the alley. Parking lots or parking spaces installed are subject to approval by the Site Review Committee, and must comply with development standards of the underlying zoning classification.

(2) In commercial zoning districts, the off-street parking requirement shall be one space per each 10 linear feet of frontage along the front lot line facing the street. All off-street parking must be located in the rear of the property. Access shall be from the alley in the rear of the property only, unless no other access is available to the site.

(J) Signage.

(1) Permissible signage shall be in accordance with the requirements and limitations of the zoning ordinance for the underlying zoning classification.

(2) On residentially zoned property, the following limitations apply to signage advertising any nonresidential use:

(a) One low-profile sign no more than 10 square feet; and no more than six feet in height unless mounted on the front face of a building or placed within a front window.

(b) If illuminated, the sign must be lit indirectly by down lighting (no internal illumination).

(K) Placement of Public Art. The placement or erection of outdoor sculpture and murals within the AOZ which is intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way or other public property shall not be subject to setback standards of the zoning district and shall not require permit approval; provided, that:

(1) The art is not for sale as the product of an art studio within the zone;

(2) The art does not constitute an advertisement; and

(3) The placement does not impede the flow of pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicular traffic, and does not block traffic visibility at intersections, alleys or driveway entrances.

(L) Approval Process. Within the AOZ, live/work units proposed in an existing structure must obtain approval from the Site Review Committee, subject to compliance with this Chapter and all applicable building-related codes. Any addition, expansion, remodeling, parking and similar changes to any nonresidential use in the AOZ requires site review approval prior to issuance of permits. A live/work unit or other nonresidential use proposed within a new structure must be approved as part of a site plan review by the Site Review Committee as established and defined in this title. In addition to a site plan, floor plans must also be provided that show the residential and nonresidential areas within the structure.

(M) Applicability of Other Provisions. This chapter is intended to operate and be applied independently of any other provision in this title that allows residential and nonresidential uses on the same parcel. An applicant may proceed under this section or under the other provisions of the zoning code that apply to a proposed use. [Ord G-2011-8 § 2, passed 5-16-11.]

Chapter 18.116 WEST FRANKLIN OVERLAY ZONE

Sections:

18.116.010    Purpose.

18.116.015    Location.

18.116.020    Applicability.

18.116.025    Approval criteria.

18.116.030    Excessive noise.


18.116.010 Purpose.

The purpose of the West Franklin overlay zone (“WFOZ”) is to facilitate investment involving improvements to land and structures within the district by offering more flexibility in uses allowed and relaxed parking standards that are consistent with the character of the West Franklin Street Corridor. The WFOZ overlays properties that are already classified into existing zoning districts. The intended result of the overlay is to establish a mixed-use area as recommended in the comprehensive plan, and to minimize the construction of new parking facilities, while still providing adequate parking that supports the desired diversity of uses, minimizes adverse impacts to adjoining residential parking, and encourages shared parking on available lots. The WFOZ establishes appropriate parking requirements in acknowledgment that the West Franklin Street Corridor is a densely developed commercial area in proximity to the Lamasco residential neighborhood. Business uses in similar urban settings typically generate somewhat lower demand for off-street parking than what is reflected in the general parking requirements for the City. [Ord. G-2018-2 § 1, passed 1-24-18.]


18.116.015 Location.

The WFOZ is established in the West Franklin Street Corridor business district as shown on the WFOZ map included at the end of this chapter, and on the official City of Evansville zoning map. [Ord. G-2018-2 § 1, passed 1-24-18.]


18.116.020 Applicability.

(A) The underlying zoning classification of the district remains unchanged. All zoning code requirements not mentioned herein as part of the WFOZ continue to apply along with all other requirements of the underlying zoning classification.

(B) The WFOZ shall apply to all permitted uses allowed in nonresidential zoning districts only. Uses permitted in residential zoning districts must comply with the underlying zoning requirements. [Ord. G-2018-2 § 1, passed 1-24-18.]


18.116.025 Approval criteria.

All new development and additions, expansions, modifications, or changes of use of existing structures within the WFOZ must meet the following requirements in order to be approved:

(A) Zoning District Requirements Specific to the WFOZ.

(1) The permitted uses in the C-4 zoning district are those listed in the underlying zoning plus the following additional uses:

(a) Single-unit residential (upper floors only); and

(b) Multifamily residential (upper floors only).

Chapter 18.117 JACOBSVILLE OVERLAY ZONE

Sections:

18.117.010    Purpose and intent.

18.117.015    Location.

18.117.020    General requirements for JOZ uses.

18.117.025    Approval criteria.

18.117.030    Approval process.


18.117.010 Purpose and intent.

Due to the unique characteristics of the Jacobsville neighborhood, the Jacobsville overlay zone (JOZ) is established in this title to offer more flexibility in land uses allowed and relaxed development standards to which new proposals for the area must be designed to meet. The intent is to provide incentives for redevelopment and private investment in the area. The JOZ overlays properties already classified into zoning districts, and developers have the option to choose to follow the alternative overlay requirements or the underlying zoning district requirements.

The intended result of the Jacobsville overlay zone is to help establish a mixed-use area with live-work businesses and other neighborhood supporting businesses integrated with traditional residential neighborhood development, while preserving the low to medium intensity character of the neighborhood. It seeks to set new guidelines for public and private development to encourage reuse of structures/land, and creative new ventures that will enhance the living and work environments in the Jacobsville area. [Ord. G-2018-19 § 4, passed 9-11-18.]


18.117.015 Location.

(A) Jacobsville Overlay Zone Map. The JOZ is established in the Jacobsville neighborhood redevelopment area immediately north of the Evansville central business district as shown on the map included in this chapter, and on the official City of Evansville zoning map.

(B) Subarea Boundaries. To establish a layering of incentives for mixed use, the Jacobsville overlay zone shall be divided into the following four distinct subareas as shown on the attached JOZ map:

(1) The residential live/work area is north of West Maryland Street and includes properties fronting on North Main Street to Morgan Avenue, and widens to include Bosse Field and certain adjacent properties following the northern perimeter of the Jacobsville redevelopment area and the JOZ.

(2) The North Main business corridor includes the properties fronting on North Main Street between Division Street and Maryland Street.

(3) The neighborhood residential area lies along both sides of the North Main business corridor and has an irregular boundary approximately following the recommended residential use area in the Jacobsville redevelopment plan.

(4) The mixed-use development area, containing the remainder of the JOZ and including large medical and industrial campuses, lies mostly west of the North Main business corridor except for certain properties that front on the primary thoroughfares crossing Main Street. [Ord. G-2018-19 § 4, passed 9-11-18.]


18.117.020 General requirements for JOZ uses.

(F) “Rear yard” means the yard extending across the full width of the lot between the rear line of the building, structure, or use and the rear line of the lot.

(G) “Side yard” means the yard between the foundation line of any part of the building, structure, or use and the side line of the lot, and extending from the front yard to the rear yard.

(H) If a commercial lot abuts a residential lot, an unobstructed yard at least 10 feet wide shall be provided adjacent to the residential lot. No primary or accessory uses or structures may be placed in this 10-foot yard.

(I) If an industrial or AIR lot abuts a residential lot, or a public, parochial or similar school for students in grades K through 12, or any subset of those grades within that range, an unobstructed yard at least 20 feet wide shall be provided adjacent to the residential lot. No primary or accessory uses or structures may be placed in this 20-foot yard.

(J) If a commercial or industrial lot abuts a residential lot in the same block frontage, the yard requirements in the residential district apply to the commercial or industrial district.

(K) On lots smaller than 40 feet in width, the boundaries of which were established by conveyance or plat before the enactment of this title, a percentage computation will apply: Every lot shall have a side yard on each side, each of which shall be at least 10 percent of the width of the lot and the aggregate width of both side yards on any lot shall be at least 25 percent of the width of the lot.

(D) Each space must be at least 12 feet by 35 feet in an area with a 14-foot clearance to classify as a required space.

(E) The Site Review Committee may recommend the reduction of a space to 12 feet by 30 feet in an area with an eight-foot clearance if the use will not normally involve the service by vehicles requiring the larger space.

(F) Plans for buildings or uses requiring off-street loading facilities by this title shall clearly indicate the location, dimensions, clearance, and loading facilities. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 24, § 10; 1982 Code § 153.099; 1983 Code § 15.153.099.]


18.135.110 Combining off-street loading spaces.

G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 24, § 11; 1982 Code § 153.100; 1983 Code § 15.153.100.]


18.135.120 Interior parking area green space.

(A) Interior parking area green space shall be provided in landscaped islands, bumpouts and/or strips within all new surface parking areas or expansions of existing parking areas having 30 or more parking spaces to reduce the visual and environmental impact of large parking lots. The term “landscaped island” shall refer to this required parking area green space. These requirements are in addition to any required front, side and rear yard setbacks, and shall meet the following standards:

(1) Parking lots shall provide one landscaped island for every 15 parking spaces. When computing results in a fraction of 0.5 of an island or higher, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number. The parking area shall be considered as the pavement devoted to parking spaces and adjoining aisles. To the extent possible, islands should be dispersed throughout the parking area. Paved areas for site loading/unloading and opaque fenced storage areas are exempt from this section.

(2) The minimum size of a landscaped island that can be applied towards these requirements shall be 136 square feet. The minimum dimension for an island without a tree is six feet. The dimensions for an island shall be measured from the inside of the curb or other barrier provided.

(3) Barriers such as permanent curbing or wheel stops shall be installed around islands to minimize damage to landscaping and for easier parking area maintenance. Pavement (at or below the surface) is prohibited inside the island barriers. However, light pole standards, storm inlets, electrical boxes and other utility/drainage facilities are allowed within landscaped islands provided they do not occupy more than 25 percent of the island area, do not block a drainage way and they meet any applicable drainage requirements.

(B) The preferred design option for landscaped islands is an island strip placed in the parking area between rows of head to head parking (see Figure A).

(1) To encourage this form of landscaped island, a credit will be provided for the area where a vehicle could overhang the island strip as long as the strip is at least 10 feet wide. This credit allows two feet of the island adjacent to the front end of the parking spaces to be counted as part of the parking spaces, reducing the paved length of the spaces from 18 feet to 16 feet (see Figure B). Only ground cover plants are allowed within the overhang area.

(2) The design grade of landscaped strips can be above or below the parking lot surface (see Figure A). Island strips with an elevation below the parking lot also function as bio-swales that can be integrated into the project drainage system. Gaps must be provided in curb or other barriers around this type of an island to allow for storm water flow into the area. Bio-swale islands are a best management practice for dealing with storm water and can lower drainage system cost. Design criteria for bio-swales must meet applicable drainage requirements.

(C) Landscaped islands can also be used to safely separate parking spaces and pedestrians, and to define access drives that help direct vehicle circulation.

(D) Each island shall contain plantings and be maintained as green space. Appropriate ground cover species, flowers, shrubs and/or trees shall be used to create an appealing landscape with shade and color. Trees are strongly encouraged, as well as use of native plantings. Lists of native trees by size recommended for planting can be obtained from the City of Evansville Arboricultural Specifications Manual. This document also offers guidance on planting procedures, soil treatment, irrigation and maintenance. Additional advice can be obtained from the City Arborist in the Evansville Urban Forestry Office, and from the County Extension Horticulture Educator.

(1) Site plans for new development must show islands and indicate the species of trees to be planted.

(2) The island plantings must be installed on a site of new or expanded development within six months of the date a Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) is issued. For attached multi-tenant businesses in a common structure, the six months shall start from the date a C of O is issued for the first business in the structure. After six months, enforcement actions will be taken including the possibility of fines if plantings have not been installed per these requirements.

(3) In parking lots with 60 or more parking spaces, trees are required to be planted in islands at a rate of one tree for every 30 parking spaces. When computing results in a fraction of 0.5 of a tree or higher, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number. All required trees are to be from the medium and large tree lists in the document referenced herein (no dwarf trees are allowed), unless other equivalent sized trees are approved by the City Arborist or the County Extension Horticulture Educator. At least 50 percent of required trees must be from the large tree list. Any existing trees to be preserved that meet these requirements as shown on a site plan approved by the City Arborist or the County Extension Horticulture Educator shall also count toward the required tree total.

(a) Minimum Size of Islands Containing Trees.

Small/medium tree – 136 square feet with a minimum dimension of eight feet.

Large tree – 315 square feet with a minimum dimension of 10 feet.

(b) Minimum Distance from Tree to Pavement.

Small tree – three feet.

Medium tree – four feet.

Large tree – five feet.

(c) The minimum sizes for islands with trees can be reduced upon approval by the City Arborist or the County Extension Horticulture Educator. To obtain approval, a site plan and island construction details must be submitted for commercial review indicating the use of structural soil, permeable pavement or an equivalent material or design (e.g., landscaped bumpouts adjacent to perimeter green space).

(d) The size of the tree stock at the time of planting shall be as follows:

Small tree – at least one and one-half-inch caliper for a single trunk.

Medium/large tree – two and one-half-inch caliper for single trunk.

	Evergreen or multi-stem trees:	Small – 10 feet in height.

	 	Medium/large – 12 feet tall.

(e) Parking Deduction for Islands with Trees. For islands that contain medium or large trees, the amount of parking spaces that these required island areas represent shall be deducted from the total amount of the parking spaces needed to comply with the off-street parking requirements as follows:

	Island Size	Island Parking Deduction

	136 to 314 square feet	1 parking space deducted/island

	315 square feet or larger	2 spaces deducted/island

This parking deduction shall also be granted for parking areas smaller than 30 spaces as long as the islands meet these standards.

(f) Islands in addition to those required to meet these standards are not eligible for the parking deduction unless they contain trees. This parking deduction shall not exceed 15 percent of the total required parking spaces before deductions are applied.

(4) In areas where sight distance is needed, landscaping shall not obstruct visibility between three and six feet above the pavement surface (no evergreens).

(E) The land owner and tenant, if any, of the parking area shall be jointly responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the islands and the landscaping to ensure the green space is kept in good condition. This shall include any necessary island repairs and replacement of landscaping as needed. If any trees die for which parking deductions were granted pursuant to this section, they shall be replaced in kind with healthy specimens on the appropriate medium or large tree lists.

(F) The Area Plan Commission Director may allow a land owner to retrofit islands into an existing parking lot; provided, that ample parking spaces will remain.

18.140.010 Purpose and substitution.

(A) The purpose of the following sign standards and regulations is to set forth provisions governing the installation and construction of signs and other advertising devices. In addition, it is the purpose of and intent of this chapter to: recognize the function and importance of signs for the business community and the City of Evansville; recognize the integral part played by signs in the overall appearance of the City; provide a reasonable set of controls that will allow and encourage creative and effective signs that adequately identify a business; and provide standards, guidance and direction for sign users and sign designers as to what constitutes appropriate signage within the jurisdiction of the City of Evansville.

(B) The owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed by this sign ordinance may substitute noncommercial copy in lieu of any other commercial or noncommercial copy. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary, with the exception of prohibitions against obscenity as defined by Indiana law. [Ord. G-2014-12 § 1, passed 7-16-2014.]


18.140.020 General provisions.

(A) Definitions.

(1) A “sign” means an identification, description, display, or illustration which is placed upon, affixed to, painted, or represented directly or indirectly on a building or land and which directs attention to a product, person, business or service. Different types and categories of signs are as follows:

(a) An “on-premises sign” is a sign directing attention to the use, business, or activity offered or sold as the primary use, business, or activity on the premises where it is located.

(b) An “off-premises sign” is a sign directing attention to a product, person, business, or service not offered or sold as the primary use, business, or activity on the premises where it is located.

(c) A “pole sign” is a sign supported by one or more poles which elevate the sign.

(d) A “monument sign” is a freestanding sign constructed upon a solid-appearing base or pedestal affixed to the ground. This definition applies to pole signs when the poles have been covered by cladding, and thus are not visible.

(e) A “banner” is a temporary sign constructed of cloth, canvas, plastic fabric or similar lightweight nonrigid material and fastened at all corners or edges to a building or other permanent structure.

(f) A “flashing” sign is one that employs a pattern of changing light where the sign illumination suddenly, instantaneously, rapidly and/or repeatedly changes for the purpose of drawing attention.

(g) A “feather banner,” sometimes also referred to as a “feather sign,” “bow sign,” or “bow banner,” is a sign that is constructed of cloth, canvas, plastic fabric or similar lightweight nonrigid material and that is supported by a single horizontal or vertical pole mounted into the ground or on a permanent structure.

(h) A “pennant” is a geometric shaped cloth, fabric or other lightweight nonrigid material normally fastened to a stringer and limited to a maximum sign area of one and one-half square feet which is secured or tethered to a building or other permanent structure so as to allow movement of the sign caused by movement in the atmosphere.

(i) A “construction sign” is a sign that contains a message relating to construction work that is in progress or upcoming on the premises where the sign is displayed, regardless of whether the sign relates to a contractor, financing provider, or the business being built.

(j) A “portable sign” is a sign that is not permanently attached or designed to be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or a pole or other temporary or permanent support. This includes a sign that is, or is designed to be, mounted on wheels or built to roll or slide or to be moved.

(k) An “electronic message sign (EMS)” is a sign capable of displaying words, symbols, figures or images that can be electronically or mechanically changed by remote or automatic means.

(2) A “sign permit” means an improvement location permit for a sign, issued in accordance with this chapter.

(B) Improvement Location Permit.

(1) Permit Required. Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge or move any sign, or cause the same to be done without first obtaining an improvement location permit (also known as a “sign permit”) issued by the Planning Department.

18.140.090 Maintenance and removal.

(A) When the product, business, or service that is advertised on a sign is abandoned or altered, or when the event or purpose advertised by the sign has passed or no longer exists, the sign and its structural elements must be removed or altered within 60 days to depict an existing product, person, business, service, or event, or to communicate an existing purpose. The owner and tenant of the land are equally responsible for removal or alteration of the sign and its structural elements.

(B) All off-premises signs must display copy encompassing the entire display face at all times. If copy is not displayed for a period exceeding 60 days, the permit for the off-premises sign may be revoked and the sign and structure may be removed, or required to be removed, pursuant to this section.

(C) Except in the case of a face change of an off-premises sign or as otherwise provided in this section, prior to the alteration of a sign or the erection of a previously removed or abandoned sign, an improvement location permit and compliance with EMC 18.140.020 are required.

(D) Every sign shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and good structural condition at all times including the replacement of defective parts, painting, re-painting, cleaning, and other acts required for maintenance of the sign. Compliance shall be required with all standards of this chapter and with all standards in this code that are applicable to signs.

(E) A sign is considered not functional when any of the following conditions exist:

(1) Its essential elements are no longer readable or recognizable;

(2) It is physically obstructed from view;

(3) A condition of dilapidation or danger exists;

(4) The area that is leased for or within 25 feet of an off-premises sign is not kept free of weeds, debris, or refuse; or

(5) Copy is not displayed on an off-premises sign for a period of 60 days.

(F) The Building Commissioner, or the Executive Director of the Planning Department, or a designee of either official, has the right of entry to inspect signs to determine whether they are functional.

(G) If a sign is not made to comply with adequate safety standards, not kept in a presentable or good structural condition, is not functional, has been abandoned, or is not removed or altered as required under subsection (A) of this section, its removal will be required as follows:

(1) The Executive Director of the Planning Department or designee(s) thereof shall provide a 10-day written notice to the owner or lessee of the sign in violation to either remove the sign or to bring it into compliance.

(2) Upon failure to comply with the written notice of violation, the Executive Director of the Planning Department, the Building Commissioner, or the respective designee(s) of either, may do either or both of the following:

(a) Remove the sign, its structure, or both, with all cost of removal to be borne by all owner(s) or lessee(s) of the sign, jointly and severally;

(b) Issue a notice of violation with fines pursuant to Chapter 18.195 EMC.

(3) The Building Commissioner or designee(s) may remove a sign, its structure, or both, immediately and without notice and with all cost of removal to be borne by the owner(s) and lessee(s) of the sign, jointly and severally, if in the opinion of the Building Commissioner or designee the condition of the sign is such as to present an immediate threat to the safety of the public.

(H) When relocation or removal of an off-premises sign becomes necessary, and documentation is provided from the owner of the site that the relocation of the sign is necessary due to construction, expansion, or other development planned for the site where the sign is located, the sign may be moved by the sign owner to another location on that same site within 20 feet of the original location of the sign, providing the location within 20 feet of the original sign does not create nonconformity of the sign. Once the sign has been removed from its original location, it may remain removed for a period of up to 90 days without requiring a permit, and will be considered to remain in existence at its original location or within 20 feet thereof during that period for purposes of locating other signs. At or before the expiration of the 90-day period, a new sign permit must be obtained for the sign being relocated or replaced. Permit fees may be waived if the sign structure is the same configuration and erected in the same manner as the original sign and is of the same or smaller size than the original sign. Removal or relocation of a sign under this subsection does not waive or alter the need for permits required by the Planning Department, Building Commission or any other agency.

(I) When replacement of an off-premises sign becomes necessary, and documentation is provided from the Building Commissioner, OSHA or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction that replacement of the sign is necessary due to the unsafe or dangerous condition of the off-premises sign, a safety upgrade by the sign owner is allowed on that same site within 20 feet of the original location of the sign, provided the safety upgrade or the location within 20 feet of the original location does not create nonconformity of the sign. Once the sign has been removed from its original location, it may remain removed for a period of up to 90 days without requiring a permit, and will be considered to remain in its existence at its original location or within 20 feet thereof during that period for purposes of locating other signs. At or before the expiration of the 90-day period, a new sign permit must be obtained for the sign being relocated or replaced. Permit fees may be waived if the off-premises sign structure is the same configuration and erected in the same manner as the original sign, is of the same or smaller size as the original structure, and documentation is provided from the Building Commissioner, OSHA or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction that replacement of the sign is necessary due to the unsafe or dangerous condition of the off-premises sign. Removal or relocation of a sign under this subsection does not waive or alter the need for permits required by the Planning Department, Building Commission or any other agency.

(J) When a legal nonconforming sign is removed, no permit may be issued to replace the sign.

(K) Electronic message signs shall be immediately turned off in the event of a malfunction. [Ord. G-2016-28 § 5, passed 10-14-16; Ord. G-2014-12 § 1, passed 7-16-2014.]


18.140.100 Enforcement.

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the enforcement of the requirements of this chapter shall be as follows:

(1) The Executive Director of the Planning Department or designee thereof will issue a warning letter to the person(s) committing, in whole or in part, a violation. The letter will identify the violation, set out required corrective measures, and specify the time frame for such corrective measures.

(2) In the event there is no response or action taken by the violator within 10 days of the notice of the violation, one additional violation letter shall be reissued explaining the violation and making demand that the violator comply or risk fine.

(3) If the violator fails to respond to the notice of violation after 30 days from the issuance of the original letter sent in subsection (A)(1) of this section, the Executive Director of the Planning Department or designee thereof shall issue a notice of violation with fines pursuant to Chapter 18.195 EMC.

(4) If at any time a person to whom a violation notice has been issued commits another signage violation in regards to this chapter, whether of the same section or otherwise, the Executive Director of the Planning Department shall issue a notice of violation along with fines pursuant to Chapter 18.195 EMC without any further warning or notice. This provision does not apply in the event the Board of Zoning Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction has found that the person did not commit any of the alleged violations referred to in the prior notices.

(B) The enforcement procedures in this chapter are subject to modifications at the discretion of the Executive Director of the Planning Department to include additional notices, extensions of time limits, or expedited or delayed steps to address immediate threats to public safety.

18.145.070    Limitations on special uses.


18.145.010 Objectives.

Certain uses are necessary to the life and economic health of the community, but have characteristics of operation that do not readily permit classification in the usual residential, commercial, or industrial districts. Because of the various types of uses and locations requiring this special consideration, the specific conditions under which each use may be permitted must be considered. These uses are specifically listed in EMC 18.145.050. Conditions for the approval of a special use are enumerated in EMC 18.145.030. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 31, § 1; 1982 Code § 153.130; 1983 Code § 15.153.130.]


18.145.020 Special uses as secondary classifications.

Special uses are secondary classifications. If land is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals for a special use, the special use designation shall be placed on the zoning map in addition to its primary zoning classification. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-87-32, passed 3-14-88; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 31, § 2; 1982 Code § 153.131; 1983 Code § 15.153.131.]


18.145.030 Procedure.

(A) A person desiring a special use classification must submit an application to the Board of Zoning Appeals at the Area Plan Commission office. The application must contain a site plan showing the following:

(1) The proposed use of the land;

(2) The location and size of all buildings and structures, including signs;

(3) The location of streets, access drives, and off-street parking and loading facilities;

(4) Buffer landscaping and required green area;

(5) Any other plans or specifications which the staff of the Area Plan Commission deems necessary.

(B) After receipt of the application, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall conduct a public hearing pursuant to IC 36-7-4 for which 12 days’ prior notice has been given by the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, to abutting property owners and to registered neighborhood associations, pursuant to EMC 2.108.060, whose boundaries include and/or are contiguous to the subject property, and to the public by legal advertisement. Also, no less than 12 days prior to the hearing, a notice containing the date, time, place, and purpose of the hearing must be posted conspicuously on the property by the petitioner. Should the petitioner fail to comply with the notice requirements, as provided by this section, before the second regular meeting of the Board of Zoning Appeals following the date said petition is filed, the petition shall be withdrawn by the Board of Zoning Appeals and the time limits imposed by EMC 18.180.040 shall apply. After public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make its determination for approval, denial, or modification of the special use classification based on the following criteria:

(1) Whether the specific site is an appropriate location for the use;

(2) Whether the use as developed will adversely affect the surrounding area;

(3) Whether there will be a nuisance or serious hazard to vehicles, pedestrians, or residents;

(4) Whether adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for proper operation of the use;

(5) Whether the use is in harmony with the Evansville and Vanderburgh County Comprehensive Plan;

(6) Whether the use is essential or desirable to the public convenience and welfare.

(C) The Board of Zoning Appeals’ approval or modification of a special use classification may include whatever reasonable conditions, limitations, or temporary uses necessary for the protection of the public interest including the following:

(1) Greater front, side, and rear yards than the minimum for the area;

(2) More off-street parking and screening;

(3) Modification of exterior design or materials;

(4) Limitations on the lot coverage and occupancy of the building or structure;

(5) Limitations on signs and sign coverage;

(6) Time limitations.

(D) To protect the public interest and to ensure compliance with requirements to be included in the site plan, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require whatever evidence and guarantees are necessary to assure compliance with conditions, limitations, and temporary uses.

(E) In addition to all other limitations and provisions contained in this title, all towers and installations permitted with SU 15 approval shall be required to submit the following additional information:

(1) Commercial site plans meeting the requirements for commercial review by the Site Review Committee, including a surveyor certification of the exact location of tower from property lines; centerlines of abutting streets or rights-of-way; and distance to the nearest residential district, residence, or recorded residential subdivision;

(2) Structural plans including elevation and plan views showing height above grade level and dimensions are required in addition to site plan;

(3) Information regarding the number of antennas that the proposed new tower or structure is designed to or can safely accommodate;

(4) Evidence demonstrating that no existing tower or structure can accommodate applicant’s proposed antenna, either because there are no existing towers or structures meeting the applicant’s engineering requirements within the geographic area that the antenna is intended to serve, or if there are towers or structures in the geographic area, evidence that such structures do not have sufficient height or structural strength to meet the applicant’s engineering requirements. This section shall not be interpreted to mandate, but rather only to encourage, co-location.

(F) Each operator of a telecommunications facility must send to the Area Plan Commission a copy of any notice sent to the FCC of intention to cease operations. All abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities shall be removed within six months of the cessation of operations at the site unless a time extension is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease which requires the applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon cessation of operations at the site shall be submitted prior to issuance of the required improvement location permit, shall be incorporated as part of the permit, and permit approval shall be conditioned upon removal of the structure(s) within six months after cessation of the use. In the event that the tower is not removed within six months of the cessation of operations at a site, the tower and associated facilities may be removed by the City and the costs of removal assessed against the property. [Ord. G-2013-17 § 4, passed 11-19-13; Ord. G-2008-13 § 1, passed 4-15-08; Ord. G-2007-14, passed 10-22-07; Ord. G-2000-9, passed 4-17-00; Ord. G-98-13, passed 7-20-98; Ord.

18.145.040 Discontinuance of special use.

(A) If a special use is abandoned for one year or has not been established within one year after the date granted, the special use classification shall be null and void.

(B) A special use may not be altered to become any use other than that approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-87-32, passed 3-14-88; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 31, § 4; 1982 Code § 153.133; 1983 Code § 15.153.133.]

Chapter 18.150 THOROUGHFARE REGULATIONS

Sections:

18.150.010    Applicability.

18.150.020    Definitions.

18.150.030    Classification of thoroughfares.

18.150.040    Compliance with title.

18.150.050    Requirements for variance.


18.150.010 Applicability.

To promote public safety, thoroughfare regulations are hereby adopted and established. These thoroughfare regulations shall be applied in the development review process including all rezoning petitions, applications for zoning use permits, and proposed plats submitted to the Area Plan Commission. All development proposals shall allocate adequate access for streets in conformity with the thoroughfare plan and shall designate and label all such streets in accordance with the following definitions, specifications, and requirements regarding control of access, platted width, and setback requirements. [Ord. G-93-17, passed 9-28-93. 1983 Code § 15.153.170.]


18.150.020 Definitions.

(A) “Control of access” means the condition where the right of owners or occupants of abutting land, or other persons, to access, including its location in connection with public ways, streets, highways or roads, is fully or partially controlled by public authority, including, but not limited to, the Area Plan Commission.

(B) “Full control of access” means the condition where access, including its location, is fully controlled in connection with the public ways, streets, highways or roads, to give preference to through traffic by providing access connections only with selected public ways, streets, highways or roads, and by prohibiting both crossings at grade and direct private driveway connections.

(C) “Partial control of access” means the condition where access, including its location, is partially controlled in connection with public ways, streets, highways or roads to give preference to through traffic to a degree that in addition to access connections with selected public ways, streets, highways or roads, there may be permitted some crossing at grade and some direct driveway connections, with design and location approved by public authority, including the Area Plan Commission.

(D) Controlled Access. Any street designated and labeled as a “controlled access” shall be a divided arterial street planned, designed, and intended for through vehicular traffic in conformance with the comprehensive plan with full control of access thereto.

(E) Major Arterial. Any street designated and labeled as a “major arterial” shall be an arterial street planned, designed, and intended for through vehicular traffic in conformance with the comprehensive plan with partial control of access thereto. Major arterials are intended to move through traffic to and from such major attractors as the central business district, regional shopping centers, and major industrial areas, or as a route for traffic between communities or large developed areas.

(F) Minor Arterial. Any street designated and labeled as a “minor arterial” shall be an arterial street planned, designed, and intended to serve as a distributor of through vehicular traffic, in conformance with the comprehensive plan, from interstates and major arterials to collector streets with partial control of access thereof. Minor arterials are similar to major arterials, except that these streets service minor traffic-generating areas such as neighborhood commercial areas, primary and secondary educational facilities, hospitals, churches and offices.

(G) Collector. Any street designated and labeled as a “collector” shall be planned, designed, and intended to serve as a collector and distributor of vehicular traffic, in conformance with the comprehensive plan, with partial control of access thereof. A collector street collects traffic from local streets and channels it into the arterial system. [Ord. G-93-17, passed 9-28-93. 1983 Code § 15.153.172.]

Chapter 18.160 NONCONFORMING USES

Sections:

18.160.010    Nonconforming uses.


18.160.010 Nonconforming uses.

Within the zoning districts of this title or by amendments which may later be adopted, there exist: (1) nonconforming structures; (2) nonconforming uses of land; (3) nonconforming uses of land and structures in combination; and (4) nonconforming characteristics of use, which lawfully exist as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this title or future amendments thereto. It is the intent of this title to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this title that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other uses or structures which are prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district.

Note: Illegal uses existing at the time the ordinance codified in this title is enacted shall not be validated by virtue of its enactment.

(A) Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this title, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this title, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:

(1) No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title;

(2) No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title;

(3) If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued, or if such nonconforming uses are abandoned for more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in which such land is located;

(4) No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this title shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

(B) Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title that could not now be built under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following restrictions:

(1) No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.

(2) Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than double its assessed value immediately prior to the damage, it shall not be reconstructed or repaired except in conformity with the provisions of this title.

(3) Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, or removed from the property for any reason, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved or rebuilt.

(C) Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Land in Combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or if a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title that would not be an allowed use in the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following restrictions:

(1) No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;

(2) A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, but no such use shall be extended to occupy land outside such building;

(3) If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or a structure and land may, upon approval of a zoning use permit, be changed to another nonconforming use; provided, that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such a change, the Area Plan Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other provisions of this title;

(4) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;

(5) When the nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and land in combination, is discontinued, or the nonconforming use is abandoned for more than six months, the structure or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located;

(6) Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.

(D) Incompatibility of Nonconforming Uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted uses in the district in which such use is located. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses which would be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located.

(E) Repairs and Maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work can be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to the extent not exceeding double the assessed value of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure, whichever the case may be; providing, that the floor area existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon such order from such official. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful by reason of neglect of its physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

(F) Special Uses Are Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use which is permitted as a special use in a district under the terms of this title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall be considered a conforming use. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 27, § 3; 1982 Code § 152.029; 1983 Code § 15.153.029.]


Chapter 18.165 VARIANCES

Sections:

18.165.010    Requirements for variance.


18.165.010 Requirements for variance.

(A) A person desiring a variance from the requirements of this title must file a petition with the Board of Zoning Appeals describing the property that is the subject of the variance, the type of variance required, the facts pertinent to the variance desired, and a site plan as defined in EMC 18.170.010.

(B) Following the public hearing on the variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals must either grant or deny the petition. No variance may be granted except on a finding of all the following factors:

(1) The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community.

(2) The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner.

(3) The strict application of the terms of this title will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property.

(4) The variance is not a variance of the use of the property.

(5) The petitioner’s property is not located in a planned unit development.

(6) The need for the variance is not created by the applicant.

(C) The Board of Zoning Appeals may not grant a variance from a use district or classification. The grant of a variance is by resolution of the Board of Zoning Appeals and is not an amendment of this title.

(D) The board may incorporate into the granting of a variance whatever conditions or limitations are necessary to protect adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood and effectuate the purpose of this title. [Ord. G-89-17, passed 5-24-89; Ord. G-76-10, passed 2-28-77. 1962 Code, Art. 9, Ch. 30, § 4; 1982 Code § 153.164; 1983 Code § 15.153.164.]
