able to show proof at the hearing that he/she meets the requirements for licensure and/or has remedied the cause that led to the suspension and has
none of the disqualifications for licensure, the license may then be reinstated. In the event the city staff suspends a license and the licensee does not
request a hearing before the city council within sixty (60) days of the written notice of suspension, then the license shall be deemed revoked and the
licensee may not reapply for a license under this chapter for one year from the date of the suspension.

the disqualifications for licensure, the license may then be reinstated. In the event the city staff revokes a license and the licensee does not request a
hearing before the city council within sixty (60) days of the written notice of revocation, then the license shall be deemed revoked and the licensee may
not reapply for a license under this chapter for one year from the date of the revocation.

available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991),
City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Cleburne, Texas; Newport News,
Virginia; Garden Grove, California; Adams County, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Las Vegas, Nevada; and Cleveland, Ohio, the city council finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for some of the activities that
occur on their premises.
2. Recent investigation by the Pocatello police department has revealed that employees of some sexually oriented businesses currently in operation in
the city of Pocatello are unable to observe the activities of their customers at all times, thereby increasing the likelihood of ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities on their premises. In one establishment, the investigation revealed holes cut into the partition separating private booths to allow
for anonymous genital contact. The doors to these private booths lock from the inside which reinforces the ability to become involved in anonymous
illicit sexual activity.
3. Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined herein as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit
sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
4. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
5. Recent investigation by the Pocatello police department found private booths in two (2) sexually oriented businesses in the city of Pocatello, where
there is reason to believe that sexual activity including, but not necessarily limited to, masturbation, is taking place within private booths in one of
those establishments.
6. Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
7. Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
8. At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.
9. Since 1981, and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) in the United States - 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 733,374 through December 31, 1999.
10. As of June 2000, there have been 488 reported cases of AIDS and 353 more reported cases of HIV infection in the state of Idaho.
11. Since 1981, and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in the state
of Idaho.
12. The number of cases of genital chlamydia in the United States reported annually has risen, with 526,653 cases reported as of 1997, making
chlamydia the most reported of all notifiable infectious diseases in the United States.
13. While the number of cases of syphilis and gonorrhea has declined, the number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually
remains at a high level, with over 325,000 cases being reported in 1997, which indicates that the annual decreases in reported cases of gonorrhea
may be leveling off.
14. The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
15. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
16. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part,
because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and
maintain those facilities.
17. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
18. Recent investigation by the Pocatello police department found potentially unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, as well as the presence of semen in
an adult film viewing booth in an existing sexually oriented business in the city of Pocatello, Idaho.
19. The findings noted in subsections A1 through A18 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.
20. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
21. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of
the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
22. Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses.
23. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce
the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 71/391
working in such establishments.
24. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented
business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
25. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who
may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
26. The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
27. The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
28. The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 2660 § 1, 2000)

shall continue for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented business license for one year from the date revocation becomes

A. Dangerous Conduct By Animal Prohibited: The owner or custodian of any animal which commits any of the acts defined in this chapter as "dangerous"
may be cited for a misdemeanor and the Animal Services Department may seize and impound the animal until the matter has been adjudicated. The

owner/custodian, or committing a trespass or other tort on the premises of the animal's owner/custodian. Specifically prohibited are the following acts:
1. If unprovoked by teasing, taunting, or a threatening manner by any person, approaching said person in an apparent attitude of attack upon the

C. Impoundment And/Or Destruction: Any animal whose owner or custodian has been found guilty of or entered a plea of guilty to the offense of
dangerous conduct by his/her animal is subject to impoundment and destruction. For a first offense, the court shall set the matter for sentencing and
notify the Office of the City Attorney (prosecutor) of the date, time, and place of sentencing. The prosecutor may request that the court order the
destruction of the animal. If the court determines that destruction is warranted, it shall issue an order authorizing any animal services officer or police

surrendered by five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on the date of sentencing.
D. Subsequent Violations:
1. Upon the conviction or plea of guilty to a second or subsequent offense of dangerous animal conduct, regardless of the form of the current or any
prior judgment, if the subsequent conduct involved the animal being dangerous, the court shall order destruction of the animal. If the court
determines that destruction is warranted, it shall issue an order authorizing any animal services officer or police officer to enter the property where
the animal is located and seize the animal and impound it for destruction if the animal has not been voluntarily surrendered by five o'clock (5:00) P.M.
on the date of sentencing.

animal caused by an unprovoked attack by any dangerous animal, plus all costs, civil judgments or penalties, criminal fines, final terms, veterinary fees,
shelter impound fees, and any other penalties and orders. In the event that the owner/custodian of the dangerous animal is a minor, the minor's parent
or guardian shall be so liable.
F. Failure To Surrender Animal: It shall be a separate offense to fail to surrender an animal for impoundment and/or destruction. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord.
2884, 2010: Ord. 2838 § 2, 2008: Ord. 2764 § 3, 2005: Ord. 2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.060: RESTRAINT AND CARE OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS:
A. Restraint Requirements: The owner/custodian of any animal convicted of a violation of the dangerous conduct prohibitions set out in this chapter shall
complete the requirements of this subsection and subsection B of this section within thirty (30) days of the date of such conviction. Every dangerous
animal shall be securely confined by its owner/custodian within a building or secure enclosure as set out herein, and whenever off the premises of its
owner/custodian, shall be either caged or securely muzzled and restrained by an adult with a chain or tether having a minimum tensile strength of three
hundred (300) pounds and not more than three feet (3') in length, and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the adult owner/custodian of
the dangerous animal. Every person harboring a dangerous animal is charged with an affirmative duty to confine the animal in such a way that persons
and other animals do not have access to such animal. To be considered secure, a facility must be constructed in a manner capable of containing the
animal. It shall be a completed structure with a securely attached roof of durable material which is secured to a foundation or concrete pad, or it shall
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

be a chainlink structure which includes a securely attached roof, and which is embedded into the ground to a depth of no less than one foot (1'). Both
the completed structure and the chainlink structure shall be at least six feet (6') in height and shall include a locking mechanism which shall be kept
locked at all times the animal is within said facility.
B. Signage: The owner/custodian of a dangerous animal shall display in a prominent place on the premises a clearly visible warning sign indicating that
there is a dangerous animal on the premises, with lettering large enough to be read from the adjacent public right of way. A second warning sign must
be posted on the facility in which the animal is kept.
C. Compliance Enforcement Authority: Animal services officers are empowered to make whatever inquiry is necessary to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, and may seize and impound any dangerous animal whose owner fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
D. Microchip Implantation And Alteration Required: Any person who has been found guilty of or pled guilty to a violation of the dangerous conduct
prohibitions set out above shall, within five (5) days of conviction, have a microchip implanted in the animal by a licensed veterinarian or the animal
services department, pay all associated costs, and, for work performed by a veterinarian, provide proof to the animal services department that the
microchip has been implanted. In addition, the owner or custodian shall have the animal spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian and shall
provide proof to the animal services department of such alteration within thirty (30) days of the conviction.
E. Notification To Animal Services: The owner/custodian of a dangerous animal shall notify the animal services department within twenty four (24) hours if
said dangerous animal is at large, is unconfined, has attacked another animal or a human being, has temporarily or permanently relocated to another
address, or has died, been sold or given away. If the dangerous animal has been sold or given away, the owner/custodian shall also provide the animal
services department with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner/custodian of the dangerous animal, within twenty four (24) hours.
F. Impoundment: If a dangerous animal whose owner or custodian has previously been found guilty of or pled guilty to a violation of the dangerous conduct
prohibitions in this chapter, regardless of the form of the prior or current judgment(s), is alleged to have committed a subsequent violation of section
6.04.050 or 6.04.040 of this chapter or this section, or is found to be at large, the animal services department shall seize and impound the animal until
the matter has been adjudicated. The owner/custodian of the animal shall be responsible for all cost of impound fees, medical care, and other
expenses for said animal while it is in custody with the Pocatello Animal Shelter, and the owner/custodian shall pay all such impound fees, medical
care, and other expenses within five (5) days of the sentencing, or animal services may dispose of the animal, including, but not limited to, adoption or
destruction, without further notice to the owner/custodian.
G. Dangerous Animal Registry: The owner of any animal found to be dangerous, by a court of law, shall within forty five (45) days of such finding, obtain a
dangerous animal registration certificate from the animal services department for a fee, as set forth in the city's annual fee resolution adopted by the
city council, in addition to other fees that may be authorized by law. The animal services department shall also provide the owner with a uniformly
designed tag that identifies the animal as dangerous. The owner shall affix the tag to the animal's collar and ensure that the animal wears the collar
and tag at all times. By January 31 of each year, until such time as the dangerous animal is deceased, all certificates obtained pursuant to this
subsection shall be updated and renewed for a fee, as set forth in the city's annual fee resolution adopted by the city council, and in the same manner
as the initial certificate was obtained. The animal services department shall post registration information on the city of Pocatello dangerous animal
registry.
H. Dangerous Animal Registration Certificates: All dangerous animal registration certificates or renewals thereof required to be obtained under this
subsection shall only be issued to persons eighteen (18) years of age or older who present satisfactory evidence: 1) of the animal's current rabies
vaccination, if applicable; 2) that the animal has been neutered or spayed; and 3) that the animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure or is and
will be confined inside the owner's residence or is and will be muzzled and confined in the owner's fenced in yard until the proper enclosure is
constructed. In addition, owners who apply for certificates or renewals thereof under this subsection shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof
unless they present satisfactory evidence that: 1) their residence is and will continue to be posted with clearly visible signs warning both minors and
adults of the presence of a dangerous animal on the property; and 2) the animal has been permanently identified by means of a registered microchip
implantation.
I. Cash Bond Required:
1. If any animal is seized under this section or any other section of this chapter, the owner or custodian of said animal shall be liable for the reasonable
costs of the seizure and the care, keeping, and disposal of the animal. Reasonable costs shall include, but shall not be limited to, transportation,
medical, board, shelter, and farrier costs.
2. If any animal is in the possession of, and being held by the city of Pocatello pending the outcome of a criminal action charging a violation of this
chapter, prior to final disposition of the criminal charge, the city of Pocatello may file a petition in the criminal case requesting that the court issue an
order forfeiting the animal to the city of Pocatello. The petitioner shall serve a true copy of the petition upon the defendant.
3. Upon receipt of a petition pursuant to subsection I2 of this section, the court shall set a hearing on the petition. The hearing shall be conducted within
fourteen (14) days after the filing of the petition. The hearing shall be limited to the question of forfeiture of the animal.
4. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection I3 of this section, the petitioner shall have the burden of establishing probable cause to believe that
the animal was subjected to conduct which constitutes a violation of this chapter, or that the animal has committed a violation of this chapter. A prior
finding of probable cause to proceed on the criminal case will create a permissive presumption that probable cause exists for the forfeiture
proceeding. After the hearing, if the court finds probable cause exists, the court shall order immediate forfeiture of the animal to the petitioner, unless
the defendant, within seventy two (72) hours of the hearing, posts a cash bond with the municipal treasurer in an amount determined by the court to
be sufficient to repay all reasonable care of animal costs incurred, and anticipated to be incurred, for the care of the animal up to the time set for trial
on the criminal case. If, after the hearing, the court finds that no probable cause exists, the animal shall be returned to the owner/custodian, and the
owner/custodian shall not be responsible for any care of animal costs unless the person later pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a violation of this
chapter, at which time the defendant shall owe all care of animal costs as restitution to the city of Pocatello in the criminal case.
5. At the end of the time for which expenses are covered by the cash bond, if the owner/custodian desires to prevent disposition of the animal, the
owner/custodian shall post a new cash bond with the municipal treasurer which must be received before the expiration date of the previous cash
bond. The court may correct, alter or otherwise adjust the new cash bond upon a motion made before the expiration date of the previous cash bond,
provided, however, no person may file more than one motion seeking an adjustment to the new cash bond.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 88/391
6. If a cash bond has been posted in accordance with this subsection, the city of Pocatello may draw from that cash bond reasonable care of animal
costs in keeping and caring for the animal from the date of the seizure to the date of final disposition of the animal in the criminal action.
7. At the end of the time for which care of animal costs are covered by the bond, if no additional cash bond has been posted in accordance with this
subsection, the city of Pocatello may determine disposition of the animal. The owner/custodian of the animal shall be liable for all unpaid reasonable
care of animal costs. Posting of the cash bond shall not prevent the city of Pocatello from disposing of the seized or impounded animal before the
expiration of the period covered by cash bond if the court orders the forfeiture of the animal or the owner relinquishes the animal.
8. Upon resolution of the criminal action, including any appeal(s), regardless of the court's decision of guilt or innocence, remaining funds deposited
with the municipal treasurer which have not, and will not be expended for care of animal costs, shall be remitted to the owner/custodian of the
animal.
9. Regardless of any other provision of this section, if in the written determination of a licensed veterinarian the animal is experiencing extreme pain or
suffering, or is severely injured or diseased and therefore not likely to recover, the animal may be immediately euthanized.
10. No proceeding under this section shall be used as a basis for a continuance or to delay the criminal case nor shall proceedings in the criminal case,
other than dismissal, be used as a basis to delay or continue the forfeiture proceeding as provided for in this section. Proceedings under this section
are of a civil nature and governed by the Idaho rules of civil procedure except as to limitations upon the discovery process. Due to the need to
conduct any proceeding necessary under this section in an expeditious manner and the right of any criminal defendant to avoid self-incrimination,
any and all discovery requests shall be granted only under authority of the court. Discovery mechanisms shall not include the deposition of any party,

and for keeping immunizations current. Vaccinations must begin when the animal has reached the age of six (6) months. Every owner/custodian must,
upon request of an animal services officer or police officer, produce proof of such vaccination(s).
B. Suspected Rabies; Quarantine Procedures: Any owner/custodian of any animal which shows symptoms of rabies, or which has bitten any person, or

of quarantine shall be at the discretion of the animal services center. All costs for the quarantine shall be borne by the owner/custodian. If an
owner/custodian refuses to surrender or confine the animal, animal services officers are hereby authorized to seize the animal and transport it to a
licensed veterinarian. Animal services officers or police officers are hereby authorized to immediately impound any quarantined animal found outside
the quarantine area and arrange for its confinement in accordance with this section. If the animal has been confined by the owner/custodian, on the
next working day following the ten (10) day quarantine, the owner/custodian shall take the animal to a licensed veterinarian for examination to be tested
for rabies and to obtain a rabies vaccination if the owner has not provided a current valid rabies vaccination certificate to the animal services center. A
copy of the examination results and a current certificate of rabies vaccination must be provided to the animal services center no later than the following
day. Failure of the owner to comply with any of these provisions shall result in the immediate impoundment of the animal, and it shall be subject to
destruction or disposal in accordance with policies of the animal services center and this chapter. If an animal quarantined at the animal services center
is determined to be free of rabies, it shall be returned to the owner or custodian upon payment of all costs for confinement, examination, and

however, that an animal services officer or other law enforcement officer may kill any such animal if he determines that the animal is so dangerous or
wild that it cannot be restrained and impounded or that further pursuit would result in losing the animal and if the animal can be killed with gunshot so
as not to damage the head. The head of any animal so killed must be severed from the body and sent to the public health department for examination
and diagnosis.
D. Control Of Contagious Diseases: It is unlawful for any person to permit or allow any animal with a contagious or infectious disease to be upon the public

any public building or place, whereby the health, safety, and well being of any person may be affected. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord. 2963, 2015: Ord. 2884,

services officer to impound the animal at the first reasonable opportunity to do so. If the name of the owner/custodian is known or can be easily
obtained, the officer may return the animal to the residential address of the owner. If there is no one present, the officer may impound the animal and
shall leave written notice at the residence of the person or place to contact to reclaim the animal. The animal services officer shall then take the animal
to the animal services center for confinement.

a problem animal, or the adopter has a documented history of possessing problem animals, or the director has good cause to believe the adopter and
the animal are an inappropriate match. In the event the adoption of an animal is denied by the director, the adopter may appeal the director's decision
by filing a written petition with the city clerk within three (3) business days of the director's decision denying the adoption. The adopter's petition must
request that the city council review the director's decision at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting for which agenda items are being

housing license shall be issued for the specified number of animals, subject to such conditions as may be deemed necessary by the director for
compliance with this chapter. If the licensee desires to house additional animals not included on the license, he shall be required to apply in the same

for violations of the provisions of this chapter, or failure to remove fecal material, or other conduct in violation of this chapter. Denial of renewal is also at

8.48.060: DISCLAIMER:
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.070: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
A. Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall directly or indirectly discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system,
including city streets, roads and alleyways or watercourses, any materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants
that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
1. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this chapter: uncontaminated water line flushing or other potable
water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water (as defined at 40 CFR section 35.2005(20)), foundation or footing drains (not including active ground water
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, individual, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian
habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than 1 ppm chlorine), fire hydrant flushing, firefighting activities, and any
other water source not containing pollutants of concern or other materials as described in this chapter.
2. Discharges specified in writing by the Pocatello city director of public works as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
3. Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the city prior to the time of the test.
4. The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance
with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted
by the city for any discharge to the storm drain system.
B. Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
1. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
2. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made prior to the enactment of this chapter, regardless of whether the
connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
3. A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage or other nonstormwater discharges to the
municipal separate storm sewer system, or allows such a connection to continue, without written city approval. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.080: SUSPENSION OF MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM ACCESS:
A. Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The city of Pocatello director of public works may, without prior notice, suspend
municipal separate storm sewer system discharge access to a person or entity when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
municipal separate storm sewer system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the director may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the municipal separate storm sewer system or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Termination Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person discharging to the municipal separate storm sewer system in violation of this chapter
may have their municipal separate storm sewer system access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its municipal separate storm sewer system access. Notification shall be made in writing by certified mail
to the owner of the property from which the illicit discharge is being made at the last known mailing address of said property owner on record with the
Bannock County assessor.
C. Written Approval Required For Reinstatement: Any person who reinstates municipal separate storm sewer system access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the authorized enforcement agency (city of Pocatello director of public works) is guilty of a
misdemeanor. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.090: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required by the city prior to allowing of discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.100: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
A. Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with commercial activity and industrial activity, including
construction activity.
B. Access To Facilities:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 115/391
1. The director of public works or his authorized representative shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter
as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the director of
public works or his authorized representative.
2. Facility operators shall allow the director of public works or his authorized representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and
the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law related to said discharges.
3. The director of public works shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
4. The director of public works has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used
to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated as required by the manufacturer's operation manual to ensure their accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the director of public works and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
6. Unreasonable delays in allowing the director of public works access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a
misdemeanor offense if the person denies the director of public works access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
7. If the director of public works has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director of public works may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2860, 2008)

shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain
system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is,
or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to
prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions
of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
applicable NPDES permit. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.120: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within said person's property free
of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not
become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.130: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, the municipal separate storm sewer system, or waters of the U.S., said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies and the Idaho department of environmental quality of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city
director of public works within three (3) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years from the date of the discharge. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.140: VIOLATIONS CONSTITUTE MISDEMEANORS:
The knowing violation of any provision or failure to comply with any requirement of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor and may be punishable by
a fine up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment in the county jail up to six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation occurs may
constitute a separate criminal offense. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.150: ACTS RESULTING IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS:
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, or discharges any pollutant or causes pollution, may also be in violation of federal laws or
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 116/391
regulations, and may be subject to the sanctions of those laws or regulations, including civil or criminal penalties, notwithstanding any legal action taken by
the city. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.160: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific, engineering, and other
relevant technical considerations. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards and this chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure
against all unauthorized discharge of pollutants. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any agent or employee thereof for any
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2860, 2008)

8.52.090: STORMWATER DESIGN CRITERIA:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 120/391
A. General: The design of stormwater BMPs shall consider public health, safety, and general welfare of the city and its citizens. These considerations
include, but are not limited to: preventing flooding of structures and travelways; preventing standing water in facilities, manholes, inlets, and other
structures in a manner that promotes the breeding of mosquitoes; preventing attractive nuisance conditions and dangerous conditions due to velocity or
depth of water and/or access to orifices and drops; and preventing aesthetic nuisances due to excessive slopes, cuts and fills, and other conditions. All
stormwater facilities and conveyance systems shall be designed in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including the
federal clean water act and all applicable erosion and sediment control and floodplain regulations. All development and redevelopment shall apply
source control BMPs selected, designed, and maintained in accordance with the PVSDM.
B. Entire Project Considered: Residential, commercial or industrial developments shall apply these stormwater criteria to land development as a whole.
Individual residential lots in new subdivisions shall not be considered separate land development projects, but rather the entire subdivision shall be
considered a single land development project.
C. Ownership Of Facilities: Stormwater facilities within residential subdivisions that serve multiple lots and/or a combination of lots and roadways shall be
on a lot owned and maintained by an entity of common ownership. Stormwater practices located on individual lots shall be maintained by the lot owner,
or, at the discretion of the public works director, be placed within an easement and maintained by an entity of common ownership.
D. Floodplains, Critical Areas, And Jurisdictional Waters: Construction of stormwater measures or facilities within a federal emergency management
agency (FEMA) designated floodplain shall be avoided to the extent possible. To the extent practical, stormwater facilities shall not be located in areas
determined to be jurisdictional waters through section 404 of the federal clean water act and/or applicable state regulations.
E. Ultimate Land Development Considered: Hydrologic parameters used in calculations shall reflect the runoff conditions for the ultimate land development
and shall be used in all engineering calculations. All predevelopment calculations shall consider open space, woods and fields to be in good condition,
regardless of actual conditions at the time of application.
F. Passage Of Upland Flow And Site Runoff: All development and redevelopment shall provide the passage of upland flow and site runoff. Conveyance of
upland flow shall maintain natural drainage patterns. Discharges from project sites should occur at the natural location to the maximum extent or, where
altered, must be situated or directed to where it would have overflowed under the conditions existing prior to proposed development. Capacity of the
drainage course downstream of the development may not be exceeded. Design calculations for passage of upland flow and site runoff shall use the
100-year, 24-hour design storm.
G. Site Runoff And Flow Control: Discharges from all new development and redevelopment must not cause a significant adverse impact to downstream
receiving waters and down gradient properties. Stormwater site plans shall provide for the on site detention and/or retention of the total water
intercepted and collected by the development and the areas (improved or unimproved) lying and draining presently to and through the proposed
development, for the design storm unless other natural or manmade systems are available for use. Flow control facilities shall be selected, designed,
constructed, operated and maintained consistent with guidance found in the PVSDM, and criteria herein.
1. Site runoff design and flow control facility design calculations for peak flow and peak volume detention requirements shall be based on detention of
the postdevelopment condition for the stated design storm, and the contributing basin size, where contributing basin size refers to the total area
above the inlet or hydraulic element. Peak discharge rates for the postdevelopment condition must be reduced to at least predevelopment rates of
the 50-year, 24-hour design storm, and to at least the predevelopment rates of the 100-year, 24-hour design storm with a maximum discharge of 0.1
cfs/acre in special drainage areas, as designated by the PVSDM.
H. Treatment: Treatment is required for discharges to all surface waters of the state, including perennial and seasonal streams, lakes and wetlands where
the impervious threshold is met. Runoff treatment is also required for discharges of stormwater to ground where the vadose zone does not provide
adequate treatment capacity as identified in the PVSDM. Stormwater site plans shall provide for the treatment of site runoff for the design storm, as
described in the PVSDM. Treatment facilities shall be selected, designed, constructed, operated and maintained consistent with guidance found in the
PVSDM, and criteria herein.
I. Wetlands: Stormwater treatment facilities are not allowed within a wetland or its natural vegetated buffer, or to provide treatment, except for:
1. Necessary conveyance systems approved by the local government; or
2. As allowed in a wetland mitigation plan. (Ord. 2944, 2015)
8.52.100: DRAINAGE EASEMENTS:
Drainage easements shall be required where a development or redevelopment is traversed by a drainageway, channel or stream. The following conditions
shall apply to all easements:
A. A stormwater easement or drainage right of way shall conform substantially with the lines of the drainageway, channel or stream.
B. Measures shall be taken to prevent down gradient impacts as a result of new development or redevelopment where no conveyance system exists at the
adjacent down gradient property line or stream, and the discharge was previously unconcentrated flow or significantly lower concentrated flow.
C. Easements may not be obstructed by structures, including fences, or filled.
D. Easements shall be of a width for construction, or maintenance, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose. Width must be able to convey the 100-
year, 24-hour storm and shall be no less than twenty feet (20') wide. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.

Chapter 9.36
DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED
9.36.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the finding and the intent of the city of Pocatello that no person shall be denied his or her civil rights or be discriminated against based upon his or her
actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, creed, sex, age, marital or familial status, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression. The Pocatello city council declares that such discrimination prohibitions are necessary and desirable for the following reasons:
A. In order to ensure that all persons, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender identity/expression enjoy the full benefits of citizenship and are
afforded equal opportunities for employment, housing, commercial property and the use of public accommodations, the city of Pocatello has
determined that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression must be addressed, and appropriate legislation
enacted.
B. It is hereby declared to be public policy of the city of Pocatello that discriminatory practices are detrimental because they impede the social and
economic progress of a city by preventing all of the city's citizens from contributing to the cultural, spiritual, social, and commercial life of the
community. The contributions of all citizens of the city of Pocatello are essential to the city's growth, vitality, and prosperity.
C. It is hereby declared that every individual in the city of Pocatello has the right to work and earn wages through gainful employment, has the right to seek
housing, and has the right to enjoy public accommodation and hospitality.
D. It is the intent of this chapter that all persons be treated fairly and equally, and it is the express intent of this chapter to guarantee fair and equal
treatment under the law to all people in the city of Pocatello. The denial of fair and equal treatment under the law due to sexual orientation or gender
identity/expression is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the city's citizens, and damages a city's economic well being.
E. This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the city of Pocatello for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health and
peace of the city of Pocatello, its residents and the community.
F. The prohibitions against discriminatory acts as provided for in this chapter are intended to supplement state and federal civil rights law prohibiting
discrimination in the areas of employment, public accommodations, and housing. For complaints, alleging discrimination on a basis proscribed under
state or federal law (e.g., race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age, gender, national origin, and/or disability) the complainant is advised of his or her
right to file a report alleging a violation of Idaho Code section 18-7301 et seq., and/or his or her right to file a complaint with the Idaho commission on
human rights and/or the federal equal employment opportunity commission pursuant to title VII of the civil rights act of 1964 as amended, the fair
housing act of 1968 as amended, or the Americans with disabilities act of 1990 as amended. (Ord. 2921, 2013)

pay a larger sum than the uniform rates charged other persons, or the refusing or withholding from persons the admission, patronage, custom, presence,

or gender identity/expression.
FULL ENJOYMENT OF: Shall be construed to include, but not be limited to, the right to use, rent or purchase real property, any service, commodity or
article of personal property offered or sold by any person or establishment to the public, and the admission of any person to accommodations, advantages,

Chapter 10.34
RESIDENT ONLY PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM
10.34.010: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
This chapter authorizes a program and an implementing procedural system by which property owners and residents in qualifying residential districts can
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 152/391
receive preferential treatment when competing with commuter vehicles for available street parking in congested areas. Such congestion, particularly when
caused by long term parking of vehicles on residential streets by nonresidents thereof who are not visiting or conducting business with residents, creates
adverse impacts on the public's general health, safety, and welfare. The burden of the adverse impact is particularly borne by the residents contributing to
neighborhood decline. In these situations, uniform parking regulations do not serve the public's interest, contribute to such decline, and often allow
nonresidents to ignore alternatives lessening such congestion. (Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.020: DESIGNATION OF RESIDENT ONLY PARKING AREAS; ISSUANCE OF PERMITS:
A. For purposes of this chapter, "resident only" permits shall be construed to include permits for employees of churches or other service organizations
within the designated resident only areas. For purposes of this chapter, references to the "traffic engineering staff", "city engineer and/or his/her
designee", or "city staff" shall be construed to mean any staff member or officer designated by the mayor to operate, manage, or conduct the program.
B. Said persons are hereby authorized to issue resident only permits to employees described above as well as to issue passes/permits for healthcare
providers, in home service providers, meals on wheels, and similar organizations to allow their staff to attend to clients living in all the resident only
parking areas. The city engineer and/or his/her designee is hereby authorized to establish procedures for applications and issuance of permits in
accordance with this chapter, design appropriate application forms, order supplies, erect or remove signs as needed, and perform such other duties
and services as might be necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
C. The city engineer and/or his/her designee shall establish resident only parking areas and erect signs to so notify the public along those streets in the
vicinity of Pocatello High School, Highland High School, and Idaho State University which he deems appropriate based upon his traffic and congestion
studies. The studies shall consider the extent to which legal on street parking spaces are occupied by motor vehicles; the extent to which vehicles
parking in the area are vehicles other than resident vehicles; and the extent to which resident motor vehicles in the residential area cannot be
accommodated by the number of available off street parking spaces. Notification of this designation and the procedures for obtaining permits shall be
mailed to each residence and/or property owner along the streets so designated by the city engineer and/or his/her designee. Parking in such areas
during the hours of seven thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. to five thirty o'clock (5:30) P.M. shall be allowed only for vehicles displaying either a resident's decal
or a visitor's permit card or an all area pass. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 § 1, 2002: Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.030: REMOVAL OF DESIGNATION; DELETION OF STREETS FROM RESIDENT ONLY PARKING AREAS:
Information generated through the original designation process and criteria set forth in this chapter shall also be utilized by the city engineer and/or his/her
designee in determining whether to remove the resident only designation from any portion of an area previously so designated.
A. Procedure; Notice: The city engineer and/or his/her designee may remove a resident parking only area from designation under the program or delete a
portion thereof after giving written notice of such intentions to the residents of dwelling units and other affected parties in the area subject to the
proposed changes. The notice shall contain a description of the area or streets to be deleted from the permit parking area and the date, time, and place
of a public hearing to consider the proposed changes.
B. Hearing And Results: The city engineer and/or his/her designee shall explain the factors justifying his proposal and hear objections at this hearing and
shall render a final decision on the proposal within thirty (30) days of the hearing. Said decision shall be rendered, in writing, and filed with the Pocatello
police department with copies mailed to residents along the affected streets. If removal from designation is approved, the city engineer and/or his/her
designee shall cause all signs designating the area as resident only parking to be immediately removed. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 § 2, 2002: Ord.
2408, 1992)
10.34.040: PERMITS; FORM; APPLICATION; FEE REQUIRED; RESTRICTED AREAS:
A. Form Of Permit: Once an area has been designated a resident only parking area, city staff shall issue parking permits in the form of decals and visitor
tags to applicants determined eligible for the permits under this chapter. A resident's parking permit shall entitle him/her to one decal and one visitor
tag, plus any additional decals or tags as provided hereafter. The permits shall be valid from August 15 of a year through August 14 of the following
year, and be in the form of numbered, color coded decals or, for visitors, in the form of numbered, color coded plastic tags. Decals must be placed on
the left rear window, or if there is no rear window or the decal cannot be clearly seen through the rear window, on the left front window of the vehicle;

B. Application, Number And Type Of Permits: Applicants must appear in person and sign and complete a form provided by the city, certifying their status
as full time residents, or other parties eligible under this chapter, and present proof of identification, address, current vehicle registration, and license
plate number. Owners of residential rental property who reside outside the area may receive one visitor tag upon presentation of proof of ownership of
the property and payment of the required fee in addition to the requirements listed above. Fees shall be nonrefundable and shall not be prorated. Fees
for the 2002-2003 program shall be as set forth herein. Thereafter, fees shall be set by annual resolution of the city council. After determination of an
applicant's qualifications and receipt of the fees, the traffic engineering staff may issue permits as follows:
1. Single dwellings (house/townhouse): One set (1 decal and 1 visitor tag); maximum of two (2) decals and two (2) tags per dwelling.
2002-2003 fee: $5.00 for 1 set

Additional decals or tags may be issued, upon receipt of the appropriate fee, if the Pocatello police department or designee determines that extenuating
circumstances warrant the deviation. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision to the public works director in writing within seven (7) days of the
decision. Fees for 2002-2003 for extra decals or visitor's permits shall be five dollars ($5.00) each; for replacement of lost visitor tags, three dollars ($3.00).
C. Permit Not A Guarantee: Issuance of a permit shall not be construed to guarantee or reserve to the holder thereof an on street parking space within the
designated residential permit parking area, nor to allow parking in violation of limitations set out in this chapter. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 § 3, 2002:
Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.050: VISITOR PERMITS:
The Pocatello police department shall issue two (2) visitor permit cards for each residence in the areas for residents to give to visitors for temporary
display in vehicles parked on the streets. Residents who are planning events which require additional temporary permits may request them from the
Pocatello police department and must return any such additional permits to the Pocatello police department no later than three (3) days after the event.
Failure to return extra permit cards will result in revocation of resident parking privileges and the Pocatello police department is hereby authorized to so
revoke the permit and notify the resident of the revocation. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.060: LIMITATIONS ON PARKING IN PERMIT AREA:
A. Permit holders and/or visitors shall be allowed to park only on either side of the street, between the intersecting side streets, on the block on which the
property(ies) for which the permit has been issued is (are) located.
B. The owner of any vehicle parked in a resident only parking area without the display of either a current resident's decal, a pass valid for all areas, or a

rear window, on the left front window of the vehicle, or displaying a visitor's permit card hung from the rearview mirror or prominently displayed on the
dashboard so as to be readily visible from the sidewalk or street; or
2. An emergency vehicle, including, but not limited to, an ambulance, fire engine, or police vehicle; or
3. A clearly marked vehicle which is under the control of a person providing a service to persons or property located in the designated residential permit
only area, including, but not limited to, a delivery vehicle.

an application therefor. It shall be unlawful for any person to: 1) obtain or attempt to obtain or display a permit or pass issued under this chapter, or 2) to
park a vehicle bearing a valid permit or pass issued under this chapter in a resident only parking area, unless he or she is a full time resident of the
dwelling unit for which the permit has been issued or is a bona fide employee of organizations eligible for permits or passes as specified in this chapter
and has been issued a permit in his own name. No person who is issued a permit shall allow it to be used by, or offer it for use to, any other person.
B. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for a person holding a valid parking permit issued pursuant hereto to permit the use or display of such
permit on a motor vehicle other than that for which the permit is issued or intended. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for a person
possessing visitor tags issued pursuant hereto to permit the use or display of such tag on a vehicle parked in the resident only area unless the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 154/391
driver/occupants are on the premises or inside the residence for which the permit was issued while the vehicle is so parked. Such conduct shall
constitute an unlawful act both by the person holding the parking permit/tag and the person who so uses or displays the permit/tag. In addition to any
other penalties, such a violation shall result in revocation of the resident's permit for the balance of the year and the Pocatello police department shall
so notify the resident. In the event a vehicle bearing a permit decal is sold, the owner shall remove the decal and inform the traffic engineering staff
who shall in turn cancel that permit.

department on private sections only in an emergency situation where the public welfare may be endangered. (Ord. 2736 § 1, 2004: Ord. 2653, 2000)
13.04.310: WATER SUPPLY CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION:
The following sections are intended to maximize the ability of the city to provide an adequate water supply for essential services in time of drought, natural
disasters, or other emergencies. All persons whose premises are connected to city water service shall be required to comply with regulations set out below
during a declared period of water shortage or water emergency. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.320: DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY FOR DECLARATION:
The superintendent shall maintain records and monitor conditions and resources to enable the city to plan for and provide water to consumers using the
city's water system. Whenever in his estimation those conditions are approaching the level of a water shortage, he shall provide a report to so inform the
mayor, who may then choose to issue a declaration of water shortage which will impose those conditions and restrictions on water usage as set out
hereinafter. The report of the superintendent will include an evaluation of the following: current aquifer levels; available ground water supply and
operational condition of city wells; current storage tank levels; the rate of decline in aquifer levels compared with the normal operating levels; projected
weather conditions as derived from short and long term weather forecasts; whether prior weather conditions over the previous year(s) have been
particularly dry with lower than normal rain and snow fall quantities; whether total aquifer storage is significantly below historical "normal" levels for the
current time of year, and whether data strongly indicate that expected demands may not be met if this trend continues and/or worsens; whether current
operating conditions would limit the city's ability to provide water; the occurrence of an extended power failure which limits the city's ability to operate its
facilities; and any state or federally imposed water restrictions which require the city to reduce the amount of water withdrawn from the aquifer. In the event
that an emergency exists or is imminent the superintendent shall so inform the mayor immediately. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.330: DECLARATION OF SHORTAGE OR EMERGENCY; EFFECT:
In the event the mayor reasonably determines that the situation warrants the declaration of a water shortage or water emergency, the mayor is authorized
to make an official declaration thereof and to suggest or impose any or all of the restrictions set forth hereinafter which he deems necessary to safeguard
the safety and health of the general public. The mayor or his/her designee shall issue a public notification of the declaration which shall specify the nature
and extent of the restrictions; in the event of a declaration of critical water shortage the restrictions will take effect twenty four (24) hours after notification;
for a water emergency the restrictions shall take effect immediately upon issuance of the public notification. Notice shall be deemed given by means of
newspaper, radio, and television announcements and a notice posted on the city's website if operational. The superintendent may provide such other
notices as he deems useful. Alleged lack of notice shall not relieve a water consumer from the duty to abide by the restrictions. After the initial declaration
of either a shortage or emergency and imposition of restrictions, the city council shall have the opportunity to review the situation at the next regularly
scheduled council meeting at which time the council shall review the circumstances surrounding the declaration, the type of declaration, and the
restrictions imposed and thereafter determine whether to continue the restrictions under the declaration, cancel the declaration and restrictions, or alter the
restrictions as deemed necessary after review of the then current situation. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.340: CATEGORIES AND RESTRICTIONS FOR SHORTAGE AND EMERGENCIES:
A. Minor Shortage; Voluntary Restrictions: If the mayor declares a minor water shortage, he shall accompany the declaration with a list of recommended
water conservation measures, which shall not be required, but are voluntary on the part of the consumers. The superintendent is hereby authorized to
conduct an intensified public information campaign to encourage such voluntary conservation measures. Such measures may include, but are not
limited to, the following:
1. Discontinuing direct hosing of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, patios, and other exterior paved or prepared surface areas, except as
may be necessary to remove or prevent accumulation of conditions or materials dangerous to the public health and safety.
2. Discontinuing noncommercial washing of privately owned motor vehicles, trailers, and boats, unless accomplished by using limited amounts of water
through use of a bucket of water for washing and a hose with an automatic shutoff nozzle for rapid rinsing.
3. Discontinuing operation of sprinkler and irrigation systems between the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and six o'clock (6:00) P.M.
4. Discontinuing operation of sprinkler and irrigation systems outside of a suggested conservation rotation schedule.
5. Careful and regular monitoring of water use and private water service and distribution lines to prevent loss of water through leaks or breaks within
the private service or distribution lines.
6. Prevention of overspray from irrigation systems beyond the area intended for watering and prevention of runoff beyond the intended area.
7. Discontinuing automatic serving of tap water at restaurants unless requested by patrons.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 200/391
B. Critical Water Shortage; Mandatory Restrictions: In the event that the superintendent determines that the water shortage is approaching a critical stage,
he shall prepare a report for the mayor detailing the problem. The mayor may then declare a critical water shortage and provide notice to the public of
the restrictions being imposed, which may include any or all of the items set forth above as he deems most useful in maintaining the necessary water
supply.
C. Water Emergency; Restrictions And Rationing:
1. Mandatory Restrictions: In the event that maximum flow reduction is immediately required, the mayor shall issue a declaration of water emergency,
and may prohibit all nonessential uses of water or impose any other restrictions he deems appropriate to attempt to maintain a supply of water for
essential services.
2. Disaster; Water Rationing: In the event of a local or regional disaster, the water supply may be jeopardized to the extent that all available water is
needed solely for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection. In such circumstances, the mayor may also implement water rationing
measures and emergency water distribution may be necessary for customers without water. Residential users may be restricted to a certain number
of gallons per day per person residing within the dwelling unit and the amount of water used by nonresidential users may be restricted to a
percentage of their historical usage as deemed appropriate by the superintendent, and/or by any other type of rationing as he deems necessary and
appropriate in the circumstances. The public works and utilities department shall disseminate information to consumers regarding the rationing plan.
(Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.350: WATER RESTRICTIONS; EXCEPTIONS:
The mayor is further authorized to make exceptions to such restrictions in specific cases as he finds reasonable which may include, but are not limited to,
watering of newly seeded or sodded lawns or of food sources, when necessary to alleviate unnecessary economic hardship to commercial or industrial
activities, or to prevent possible damage to health, safety or welfare. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.360: VIOLATIONS; ISSUANCE OF INFRACTION CITATIONS:
It is unlawful for any person to violate water use restrictions imposed under this chapter, unless an exception in writing has been granted by the mayor.
Violation of these provisions shall be an infraction, punishable as provided by the Idaho Code for nonmoving infractions. Each violation of restrictions
issued under this chapter may result in issuance of a separate infraction citation. Upon the issuance of the third infraction violation for an account, the
utility billing department is authorized to terminate water service to the premises. Standard turn on and turn off fees set by city council resolution shall be
charged, and water service shall not be reinstated until all fees have been paid in full.
In the event that repeated violations at the same premises are noted during the term of any declaration hereunder, and if the police are unable to make
contact with the responsible party due to what appears to be deliberate avoidance of service rather than absence from the jurisdiction, after the third such
documented instance of violation, the police shall contact the utility billing department, and the supervisor of that department shall arrange for water
service to the premises to be terminated. Standard turn on and turn off fees set by city council resolution shall be charged, and water services shall not be
reinstated until all fees have been paid in full. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.370: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, part or portion of this chapter is for any reason held to
be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this chapter. (Ord.
2738 § 3, 2004)

No water service connection (potable, irrigation or fire protection) to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water
supply is protected as required by state law and regulation and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor
if a backflow prevention device required by this chapter is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been
removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are
corrected. (Ord. 2653, 2000)
13.08.050: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES; INSPECTION:
The consumer's system should be open for inspection and tests at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the purveyor to determine whether
cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the
director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected

assure that cross connections do not exist;
D. Premises having a history of cross connections being established or reestablished;
E. Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters;
F. Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled in such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard might
result;
G. Where it is deemed necessary to protect the city's water meter from hot water, steam or other possible contaminants, the water department shall have
the right to order the owner to install check valves and pressure relief valves which must be approved by the water superintendent, and failure on the
part of the owner to install such valves within ten (10) days after written notice has been served shall be sufficient cause for discontinuance of water
service. The owner may request a hearing prior to discontinuance as provided in section 13.04.130 of this title.
H. The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public water

objectives of this chapter are:
A. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will interfere with the operation of the POTW;
B. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
C. To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level which allows the use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations;
D. To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
E. To preserve the hydraulic capacity of the POTW;
F. To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the POTW.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect discharge to the POTW through the
issuance of discharge permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for other users, authorizes monitoring and

Notes:
1. Pollutants are total and in mg/l unless otherwise specified.
2. The city may, at its sole discretion, implement local limits through allocation of the maximum allowable industrial load (MAIL) to industrial users. The
MAIL is the total load available to be allocated to significant industrial users and corresponds to the uniform concentration local limits shown in the table
above. The MAILs are hereby incorporated by reference.
B. Toxic Organic Management Plan (TOMP): Users with wastewater that may contain any of the toxic pollutants listed in 40 CFR 122, appendix D table II
or pollutants that may be reasonably expected to be present shall, as part of the permit process, report the analyses for the toxic pollutants. If any of
the toxic pollutants are found in the analyses, then the user may be required to continue to monitor for those toxic pollutants or the user may be allowed
by the city to develop a TOMP in lieu of periodically monitoring for those toxic pollutants. The user must routinely submit a certification statement as
part of its periodic self-monitoring report which asserts that there has been an increase in the discharge over previously reported amounts.
C. Applicability: The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of pipe). The superintendent may impose mass
limitations in addition to (or in place of) the concentration based limitations above. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit of applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.
D. Other Pollutant Limits: The following limits shall apply to wastewaters that are discharged from the groundwater cleanup of petroleum or gasoline
underground storage tanks or other remediation wastewaters containing these pollutants or where these pollutants are appropriate surrogates. It shall
be unlawful for any industrial user to discharge or cause to be discharged any waste or wastewater to the POTW that exceeds the following limits, as
applicable:
Pollutant
Daily Maximum
Limit (mg/l)1
Benzene 0.050
BTEX2 0.750
Notes:
1. All pollutants shown in the table are total.
2. BTEX shall be measured as the sum of benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylenes.
(Ord. 2925, 2013)
13.20.050: RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the
POTW. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.055: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case
will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or a federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request
a net/gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. Users may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment
standard from the approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. Such a request will be approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to
its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.060: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.065: LIMITATIONS ON POINT OF DISCHARGE:
No user shall discharge any waste or wastewater directly into a manhole or other opening unless they have been issued a permit by the city. If a permit is
issued for such discharge, the user shall pay the applicable charges and fees and shall meet all conditions required by the permit. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.070: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 217/391
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.075: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a
shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered
by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the federal categorical
pretreatment standard.
New source and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install, have in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical
pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit which is in noncompliance with any
local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule included in the wastewater discharge permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time
feasible. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.080: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT:
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sanitary sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from
industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
C. A grease interceptor or a grease trap is not considered to be properly maintained if for any reason it is not in good working condition with all internal
required plumbing of proper design and length in place, or if the operational fluid capacity has been reduced by more than twenty five percent (25%) by
the accumulation of floating and settled solids, oils, and greases. The owner of any premises required to install a grease interceptor; the lessee and
sublessee, if there be such; and any proprietor, operator, or superintendent of such facility are individually and severally liable for any failure of proper
maintenance of such grease interceptor.
If the grease interceptor is not maintained adequately under the conditions of use, the grease interceptor shall be resized and the user shall install one
which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose.
When a grease interceptor/trap is cleaned, the sidewalls shall be scraped and hosed down, while all the solids and liquids contained are removed. All
wastes removed from any grease interceptor/trap shall be legally disposed of other than to the sewer. The city of Pocatello specifically prohibits the
following grease interceptor/trap practices:
1. Pumping to remove only accumulated sediments or floating materials;
2. Pumping operations which specifically separate floating or sediment interceptor solid wastes from wastewater and then return or decant the
separated wastewater back into the grease interceptor/trap;
3. Transporting any hauled pollutants from another location for discharge into a grease interceptor/trap.
Use of grease interceptor/trap treatment products, including bacteria, designed to digest the grease, is specifically prohibited.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. (Ord.
2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.085: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLANS:
The superintendent may require any user to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed
necessary by the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and
expense. An accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to
the city for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be
submitted within sixty (60) days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been
reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
A. Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following:
1. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
2. Description of stored chemicals;
3. Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of accidental or slug discharges. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the standards in sections 13.20.030 through 13.20.045 of this chapter; and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 218/391
4. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental or slug discharges. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training,
building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and
equipment for emergency response.
B. Users shall notify the city wastewater treatment plant immediately after the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated by this
chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any
affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account
thereof under state or federal law.
C. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
D. Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.
(Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.090: SEPTIC TANK WASTE:
A. Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at the designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, located at 10733 N. Rio
Vista Road, and at such times as are established by the superintendent. No other point of discharge within the city's collection system will be allowed
without the expressed written permission of the superintendent. The discharge of any hauled waste to a point in the city's collection system, other than
as specifically designated by the superintendent, shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and shall be subject to enforcement action. Such
wastes shall not violate any section of this chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city.
B. All domestic septic tank waste, portable toilet waste or other hauled waste deemed acceptable by the superintendent will be subject to the terms and
conditions contained in the city's general regulations of waste haulers, incorporated herein and made a part hereof.
C. Discharges of nondomestic hauled waste shall be subject to the applicable prohibited discharges as set forth in sections 13.20.030 through 13.20.045
of this chapter, as well as any applicable federal, state and local regulations governing hauled waste or any conditions the superintendent deems
necessary for protection of its treatment works.
D. Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as being preemptory of any other regulations governing hauled waste, or waste haulers, or
any business activities pertaining to hauled waste, or as set forth in any federal, state or local guidance governing hauled waste.
E. Any waste hauler seeking to discharge hauled waste to the POTW, or to any designated point within the city collection system, must have a city
approved waste hauler's permit. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of
each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. The superintendent may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis
of any load prior to discharge. The superintendent reserves the right to refuse permission to dump any load that is suspected of being incompatible or
that is determined to be incompatible with the POTW through sampling and analysis, or sound professional judgment.
F. Waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every load. A waste tracking form approved by the POTW shall be used to record every load that
is delivered to the POTW. Failure to accurately record every load, falsification of data or failure to transmit the form to the superintendent prior to
discharge into the POTW may result in revocation of this permit.
G. Fees for dumping hauled wastes shall be charged each time a waste hauler delivers or causes to be delivered a load for discharge, based on tank size.
Such fees shall be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. Failure to pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the billing date shall be cause
for revocation of the waste hauler discharge permit.
H. Liability insurance is required. Each waste hauler must carry commercial general liability insurance in such amount and in such form as shall be
determined by the city and specified as part of the permit. The city shall be named as an additional insured party in the policy. Proof of insurance
coverage must be provided to the city prior to the issuance of the permit and annually as long as the permit is in effect. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.095: WASTEWATER ANALYSIS:
When requested by the superintendent, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within thirty (30) days of the
request. The superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. (Ord. 2837 § 1,
2008)
13.20.100: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the superintendent; the
permit must be enforceable and contain all the elements as required by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(l)(iii)(B). Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set forth in this chapter.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal, state and local standards and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 219/391
requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law.

include a written certification by the new owner and/or operator which:
A. States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes;
B. Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
C. Assumes full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit beginning on the date of the transfer.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
Provided that the notice required above occurred and that there were no significant changes to the manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the
new owner will be considered an existing user and will be covered by the existing limits and requirements in the previous owner's permit. (Ord. 2837 § 1,
2008)
13.20.160: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REVOCATION:
The superintendent may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for, but not limited to, the following reasons:
A. Failure to notify the superintendent of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
B. Failure to provide prior notification to the superintendent of changed conditions;
C. Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;
D. Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
E. Tampering with monitoring equipment;
F. Refusing to allow the city timely access to the facility premises and records;
G. Failure to meet effluent limitations;
H. Failure to pay fines;
I. Failure to pay sewer charges;
J. Failure to meet compliance schedules;
K. Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application;
L. Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted facility;
M. Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter; or
N. If the city has to invoke its emergency provision as cited in section 13.20.305 of this chapter or its nonemergency provision as cited in section 13.20.310
of this chapter;
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued
to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.162: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION APPEALS:
Any interested person, including the user, may petition to the city council for reconsideration of a wastewater discharge permit modification or transfer
within ten (10) days of the issuance of said modification or revocation.

of judicial review.
E. Aggrieved parties seeking review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the district court
of the sixth judicial district in and for the county of Bannock within two (2) years from the date of said final decision. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.165: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REISSUANCE:
A user who is required to have a wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete
wastewater discharge permit application, in accordance with section 13.20.120 of this chapter, a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the
user's existing wastewater discharge permit. A user whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who has submitted its reapplication in
the time period specified herein shall be deemed to have an effective wastewater discharge permit until the city issues or denies the new wastewater
discharge permit. A user whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who failed to submit its reapplication in the time period specified
herein will be deemed to be discharging without a wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.170: BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS:
Users that become subject to new or revised pretreatment standards are required to comply with the following reporting requirements even if they have
been designated as nonsignificant categorical users:
A. Submittals: Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative
decision on a categorical determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the POTW, or any other user at the request of the city, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed
in subsection B of this section. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical
users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the
information listed in section 13.20.120 of this chapter. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
B. Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or operations and maintenance (O&M) will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the
shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall
not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet
the requirements set out in section 13.20.180 of this chapter.
C. Modified Categorical Pretreatment Standard: Where the user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR
403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user
submits the report required by this subsection, the information required by subsections 13.20.120F and G of this chapter shall pertain to the modified
limits.
D. Modified Information Required: If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream
formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsections
13.20.120F and G of this chapter, then a report containing modified information shall be submitted by the user within sixty (60) days after the new limit
is approved.
E. Certification Required: All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with section 13.20.125 of this chapter and signed by an
authorized representative as defined in section 13.20.020 of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.175: FINAL COMPLIANCE REPORT (INITIAL COMPLIANCE REPORT):
A. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance of an existing significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements set forth in this chapter, in federal categorical standards, or in a wastewater discharge permit, or, within thirty (30) days following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source or a new user considered by the city to fit the definition of SIU, any
user subject to this chapter shall submit to the city a report containing the information outlined in sections 13.20.120 and 13.20.170 of this chapter.
B. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual
production during the appropriate sampling period. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 225/391
13.20.180: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
Any users may be required to submit periodic compliance reports by permit or at the request of the superintendent.
A. All significant industrial users shall comply with all applicable requirements under 40 CFR 403.12 and submit to the city during the months of June and
December, unless required on other dates or more frequency by the city, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting period.
The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their discharge at
least twice per year. In cases where best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternatives are required, the user must submit
documentation required by the superintendent or the applicable pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
B. The report shall include a record of the concentration (and mass if specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and record of all flow measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling
locations and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if
required by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user
sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required by the city or by this chapter, using methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
C. Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards shall report production data as outlined in section 13.20.175 of this chapter.
D. If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or nonregulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated process
flows, dilution flows, and nonregulated flows.
E. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual measurement is not feasible.
F. Discharges sampled shall be representative of the user's daily operation and samples shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in
sections 13.20.225 and 13.20.230 of this chapter.
G. The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent, or determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the sewer system.
H. The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by the user, the city may agree to perform periodic compliance monitoring needed to
prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the city agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the
user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal
sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user. (Ord.
2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.185: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
A. The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction,
etc.).
B. No increment referred to in subsection A of this section shall exceed nine (9) months.
C. Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects
to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.190: NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES:
Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two (2) business
days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the calendar month. Any user not providing a
notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
A. The superintendent may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 13.20.120 of this chapter.
B. The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 13.20.165 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit under section 13.20.150 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 226/391
13.20.195: HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION:
Any user that is discharging more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar
month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide
notification in writing to the city and a onetime notification in writing to the EPA region 10 office of air, waste, and toxics director, and to the state of Idaho
department of environmental quality hazardous waste manager within ten (10) days of discovery that said discharge occurred. Any existing user exempt
from this notification shall comply with the requirements contained herein within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of a discharge of fifteen (15) kilograms
of hazardous wastes in a calendar month or any discharge of acutely hazardous wastes to the POTW.
Such notification shall include:
A. The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261;
B. The EPA hazardous waste number; and
C. The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
D. If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also
contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily available to the industrial user:
1. An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes,
2. An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestreams discharged during that calendar month, and
3. An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements.
Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of
the discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this section, an industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal, state and local law. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.200: NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL SPILLS, SLUG LOADS:
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW
of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user. Any user who discharges a slug load of pollutants shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the
amount of any fines imposed on the city under federal, state or local law.
B. Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge
described in subsection A of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
D. Users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.205: NONCOMPLIANCE REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis for two (2) consecutive days, within five (5) days of becoming aware of the violation. The
results of the repeat analysis shall be submitted to the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the city has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and
requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if:
A. The city performs sampling and analysis at the user at a frequency of at least once per month, or
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 227/391
B. The city performs sampling and analysis at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city
receives the results of this sampling analysis. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.210: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE:
All users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including
significant manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.215: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the superintendent may require. (Ord. 2837
§ 1, 2008)
13.20.220: RECORD KEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses including documentation associated with best management practices. These records shall remain available for a period of at least
three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the POTW, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the superintendent. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.225: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS:
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
A. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, twenty four
(24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the city. The samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must
be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
B. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR
403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
C. Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from the pretreatment facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by the city and specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For
categorical users, if other wastestreams are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable
categorical pretreatment standards. For other users, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).
D. All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that the wastestream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was
required in its individual wastewater discharge permit using methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.230: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.235: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in sections 13.20.225 and 13.20.230 of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

13.20.245: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING; RIGHT OF ENTRY:
The city shall have the right to enter the facility of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
D. Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.250: MONITORING FACILITIES:
A. Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspections, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer
discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises, except, where such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The superintendent, whenever applicable, may require the construction and
maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line or a wastewater treatment system).
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, including
the sampling and measuring equipment, shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
C. The superintendent may require the user to install equipment as necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance
with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.255: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the superintendent shall seek issuance of a search warrant from the district court of the sixth judicial district in
and for the county where the property is situated. Such warrant shall be served by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of the
city. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.260: VANDALISM, FALSIFYING, OR TAMPERING:
No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter.
No person shall make any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report or plan, or other document filed or required to be
maintained pursuant to this chapter. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord. 2837
§ 1, 2008)
13.20.265: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, and monitoring programs, and from the
superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When
requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing
the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential
information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.270: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The superintendent shall publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 229/391
by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the TRC (TRC equals 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous limits,
or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutant that may cause imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to provide within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation or groups of violations, which may include a violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.275: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten
(10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.280: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 13.20.290 and
13.20.295 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.285: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may
be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in section 13.20.020 of this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.290: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in the
order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)

13.20.295: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.300: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
A. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the superintendent shall have such other collection remedies as
may be available for other service charges and fees.
C. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty percent (20%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the highest legal rate allowed by law. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
D. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request to the public works director for reconsideration of the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. The public works director may convene a hearing on the matter within thirty (30) days of
receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
E. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.305: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge without formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to city workers, the general public, and/or to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sanitary sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent
shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 13.20.310 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing
the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under sections 13.20.285 and 13.20.310 of this chapter.
C. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.310: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE, NONEMERGENCY:
In addition to the provisions in section 13.20.160 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
A. Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
C. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 231/391
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
E. Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 13.20.030 through 13.20.045 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 13.20.285 of this chapter
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.315: APPEAL OF SHOW CAUSE HEARING DECISION, COMPLIANCE ORDER, CEASE AND DESIST ORDER, OR
NONEMERGENCY TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
Any interested person, including the user, may petition to the city council for reconsideration of a show cause hearing decision, a compliance order, a
cease and desist order, or a nonemergency termination of discharge within ten (10) days of the issuance of said decision or order.
A. Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
B. In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the decision being objected to, the reasons for this objection and an alternative proposal, if any, it seeks
to be applied to the wastewater discharge permit.
C. The effectiveness of the decision, order or termination regarding the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.
D. If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days from the receipt of a petition for review, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied.
Decisions not to reconsider a show cause hearing decision, a compliance order, a cease and desist order or a nonemergency termination order of a
wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
E. Aggrieved parties seeking review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the district court
of the sixth judicial district in and for the county of Bannock within two (2) years from the date of said final decision. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.317: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may petition the district court of the sixth judicial district in and for
the county of Bannock through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city may also
seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.320: CIVIL PENALTIES:
A. A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In
the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B. The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the
compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.325: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
A. A user who has wilfully or negligently violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.
B. A user who wilfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and/or be subject to imprisonment for six (6) months.
This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.

C. A user who knowingly made any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed,
or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.330: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The superintendent reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement in response to pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response
plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.335: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files
a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.340: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first
submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.345: PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING FEES AND PENALTIES:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or
penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this chapter, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. (Ord. 2837 § 1,
2008)
13.20.350: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, after the user has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.355: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of this code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying
said nuisance. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.360: UPSET:
A. For the purposes of this section "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused
by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days:
a. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 233/391
b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
and
c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of their treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.365: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS; DEFENSE:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 13.20.030
of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly
in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. (Ord.
2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.370: BYPASS:
A. Defined Terms: For the purposes of this section, the following terms are defined as follows:
BYPASS: The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. Acceptable Bypass Conditions: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this
section.
C. Bypass Notification:
1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if
possible.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24) hours
from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty four (24) hours.
D. Bypass Prohibited; Exceptions:
1. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
c. The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this section.
2. The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.375: PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES:

13.30.010: DEFINITIONS:
ACCOUNT HOLDER OR ACCOUNT OWNER: The person who signs for utility service to any premises, to whom bills are sent, and who is responsible for
paying all costs associated with the utility service, whether or not he is the owner of the premises.
OWNER: The owner of the premises receiving utility services, whether person, firm, corporation, partnership, or joint venture. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.020: AUTHORITY AND DUTIES:
Billing and collection for city utility services, including water, refuse collection, and sewer services charges, and any attendant setup, transfer, processing
and billing fees and deposits shall be accomplished by the utility billing department, which shall also establish and maintain accurate accounts and records
for these utilities, receipt monies paid for these services and deposit them with the city treasurer. The city treasurer shall establish capital reserve accounts
consisting of percentages of gross revenue sufficient for each utility as specified by the city council, and ascertain that revenues are accurately
apportioned among the funds and the reserve accounts. Procedures for establishing accounts, revocation of service, level pay plans, continuous service
agreements, vacancy declarations, and deactivation requests shall be set by the utility billing director and a copy of the written policies, forms, and
procedures made available for public inspection in the department. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.030: GENERAL BILLING PROCEDURES:
Billings for utility services shall be made monthly, with charges for each service listed separately on the bill. Rates and charges shall be as set by
resolution of the city council or this chapter. All account records shall be kept by the premises street address, and shall include the account number
assigned thereto, the name of the owner or tenant, whether individual, corporation, joint venture, or partnership, and shall be in the name of an account
holder, whether owner, tenant, or authorized representative, who shall be the party responsible for payment. Prospective account holders shall be required
to complete an application for service for initiation or continuance of service as set out below. If the owner is other than an individual, proof of authorization
for an individual to be designated as account holder shall be required, that individual must complete the application for service and agree to be designated
as the person responsible for payments on behalf of the entity. A tenant of any premises which has its own separate metered water service may be listed
as the account holder and shall be the responsible party for payment of utility service charges if the said tenant completes the application for service.
Provided, however, that if any rental premises has a history of account delinquencies, the utility billing director may require that the owner of the premises
become the account holder and be responsible for payment. (Ord. 2903, 2011)
This section has been affected by a recently passed ordinance, 2995 - UTILITY BILLING . Go to new ordinance.
13.30.040: ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTS:
A. Application For Service: The utility billing department shall provide application forms for water, sewer, and/or refuse collection services. The owner of a
premises, his/her authorized agent, or a tenant if authorized, shall provide proof of identification and authorization from the owner, if applicable, and
complete the application for service in order for service(s) to be established or transferred to a different name. Applications for service must be updated
when either the owner or the responsible party is changed for any premises. Contractors or tenants of premises who do not have accounts in their
name for that premises but wish to have additional refuse service(s) at the premises, may establish a separate account and receive service after
completing an application for service and paying any required fees or charges.
B. Fees And Deposits: The utility billing department shall collect fees for turning water service on and/or off, for transferring accounts, and such other fees
and deposits as set from time to time by resolution of the city council. If water service is available to the premises but is not on, a turn on fee shall be
charged and due with the first regular billing statement for the premises. In the event water is still on at the premises, a transfer fee shall be charged
and due with the first regular billing statement for the premises. Payment of a deposit may be required as determined by the utility billing director, or
his/her designee based upon credit reporting information. If service was previously established in the name of a spouse, and an ex-spouse, widow, or
widower desires an account in his/her own name, no fee shall be collected for the transaction. All deposits shall be held as guarantee of payment.
Upon termination of utility service, any such deposit may be refunded to the party in whose name the account is listed, less any sum which may be due
the city. Provided, however, that if the customer is moving to another service address, the final balance for the former service address, less any
deposit, if applicable, may be transferred from the customer's former account and credited and/or charged to the new account. An account holder
owing a past due amount may not open a new service account until the past due amount is paid in full. An account which is unpaid and/or sent for
collection shall be deemed to be an account which was shut off for nonpayment, and neither a reinstatement of service nor a new service shall be
provided until all amounts owed and an applicable deposit have been paid. A reconnect/nonpayment fee shall be charged on any account which was
shut off for nonpayment, and said fee shall be due with the first regular billing statement thereafter.
C. Certificate Of Occupancy Required: No application for service shall be granted, and no account shall be established for newly constructed premises,
additions, or major remodeling, until the owner/occupant has received a certificate of occupancy from the building department and has submitted a
copy of it to the utility billing department; provided, however, that a contractor needing water service to the premises under construction may open a
new temporary account in his name for water only for a maximum of ninety (90) days for residential construction or, in the case of commercial
construction, for a period as determined by the building official and utility billing director. At the end of that period, such temporary water service shall
be terminated and will not be reinstated without payment of the applicable turn on fee. If necessary, the contractor may request extensions, prior to the
expiration of the period of temporary service, for an additional thirty (30) days each, contingent upon inspection and written certification by the building
department that construction is still proceeding. After construction has been completed and a certificate of occupancy issued, any such water only
account may be transferred to the name of the owner of the premises, and a regular utility account established. In the event that any temporary
certificate of occupancy is revoked, or if a premises is found to be occupied without the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the building official shall
notify the utility billing director, the utility account will be terminated, and water service will be shut off after proper notice to the occupant. (Ord. 2977,

13.30.050: CHARGES COMPUTED SEPARATELY FOR EACH METER:
If an individual consumer is supplied with water through more than one metered service for the same address, charges shall be computed separately for
each individual meter, but billed on a single bill. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.060: MORE THAN ONE CONSUMER ON SINGLE METER:
If more than one individual consumer is supplied with water through one meter, the owner who applies for service shall be responsible for all charges.
(Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.070: LEVEL PAY PLAN:
An account holder who has received water service at the same premises for at least twelve (12) consecutive months may request a level pay plan for utility
charges. The utility billing staff shall then total the previous year's consumption charges and establish an average monthly charge to be used for
subsequent billings. The staff shall conduct annual checks and recalculate level pay amounts annually in order to maintain a sufficient level of payment to
cover the utility charges. Regardless of usage, the full amount set as the level payment shall be due every month during the twelve (12) month cycle. No
adjustments or refunds shall be allowed during any twelve (12) month level pay cycle, unless an account has been finalized and a credit balance remains.
If there are any delinquencies in payment, or any insufficient funds check has been presented for an account, the account's level pay option shall be
canceled and the regular billing process reinstated. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.080: ADJUSTMENTS:
Except as herein provided, no credits, reductions, or waivers of charges shall be allowed for water or sewer services if water service is turned on at a

A. Circuit Breaker Reduction: The utility billing staff shall make the reduction provided for in the utility rate resolutions set by the city council for account
holders whose names appear on the "circuit breaker exemption list" of Bannock County, effective January 1 of each year. The reduction shall be solely
for the account holder's own residence.
B. Mobile Home Parks: If mobile home parks are provided with auto cart service, when a lot/pad becomes vacant, i.e., unoccupied by any mobile home,
camper trailer, recreational vehicle, or the like, the owner of the park, or his duly authorized agent, may request removal by the sanitation department of
the auto cart for that pad. Once removed, no refuse collection charge shall be made for that lot/pad until another cart is delivered and service resumed.
Information supplied shall be subject to verification by city personnel and any falsification may result in back billing and late fee charges.
C. Seasonal Summer Lines: Summer lines are separate metered lines established for summer irrigation use only. Service shall be initiated seasonally at
the request of the owner and a turn on fee shall be included on the first regular billing statement. The seasonal summer line will be turned off in the fall
either at the owner's request, or if no request is received, the utility billing staff may shut off service at the time meter reading is discontinued for the
season. No turnoff fee will be charged.
D. Water Leak Adjustments: Meter readings and charges for water service will be considered accurate unless protest is made to the utility billing
department within thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill. Adjustment may be allowed in the event evidence clearly shows that the apparent excessive
consumption was due to underground leaking of pipes or fixtures, that the situation was promptly reported to the utility billing department, and that
repairs were promptly made. The utility billing director shall determine the number of gallons of water usage which could reasonably be the result of
leakage and authorize a billing credit of one-half (1/2) the amount of the charges attributable to leakage for one billing period only. Requests for
adjustments for longer periods of time or for additional amounts shall be referred to the water superintendent whose decision shall be final.
E. Continuous Service Requests: Owners of single-family residences may request that utility service revert to their names and accounts following finalizing
of the account by any tenant occupant of the premises. A transfer fee shall be charged for the initializing of each account and utility service will
continue under the terms of the agreement.
F. Estimates: An estimated bill for water/sewer service may be issued when weather or other circumstances do not permit reading of meters. Estimated
bills will be calculated by utilizing the consumption figure for the corresponding period of time for the previous year and the current water rate. If
estimated rates charged are higher than actual consumption, a credit will be issued to the account based on the first meter reading thereafter. (Ord.
2903, 2011: Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.090: ACCESS TO PREMISES AND METER:
A. Employees of the utility billing department properly identified shall have unobstructed access from seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to nine o'clock (9:00) P.M.,

13.30.100: DUE DATES:
Utility charges shall be due and payable monthly in accordance with the billing cycle set out on the payment notices. Failure to pay a previous month's
charges by five o'clock (5:00) P.M. of the working day prior to preparation of the subsequent month's billing shall be considered a delinquency and cause
for termination of water service. Delinquent amounts shall be posted on the bill and a late penalty charge as set by resolution of the city council, shall be
added to the amount due. A written notice of the delinquency and pending termination of water service for failure to pay in full shall be posted on the bill. If

A. Ensure that applicable insurance, bonding, permits, licenses, or registrations are obtained prior to commencing work or allowing subcontractors to
commence work and accurately report the value of the construction on all forms.
1. Builders must provide authorization for the work to be performed in the form of a written contract when applying for a permit for work covered under
the contract; this requirement may be fulfilled by providing a copy of an accepted bid or estimate signed by both the builder and the client which
includes the total cost of the work.

being charged and such additional information as deemed appropriate by the city; requests for permits must be made prior to commencement of the
work.
B. Pay on time and in full all fees assessed for permits; in the case of phone in permits or permits for which monthly statements are issued, to pay all
amounts due within thirty (30) days of the statement date. Payment by means of "insufficient funds" or canceled account checks shall be deemed a
violation of this requirement unless payment in full is tendered in cash, money order, or cashier's check, along with returned check fees within three (3)
working days of notification from city staff. No permits may be issued to any contractor whose account is in arrears through late payment, lack of
payment, or denial of payment by a financial institution, until all fees due have been paid in full in cash, money order, or cashier's check.
Note: Contractors must be in good standing, i.e., possess current valid licenses, bond and insurance coverage as required, and not be delinquent in
complying with conditions or deadlines on other projects or delinquent in payments in order to be issued permits for work covered by the license.

construction codes and the terms of any applicable permits, whether such work is done by the contractor or by a subcontractor.
E. Make prompt and valid payment to all subcontractors and materialmen in an amount proportionate to the work done, materials received, and payment
received from the client. The filing of a lien against a client's property by subcontractors or materialmen may constitute violation of this requirement.
F. Obtain inspection services promptly and in the proper sequence when the same are required by this or any other ordinance of the city and maintain
accessibility and visibility for the work until inspection and approval have been obtained.
G. Obtain final inspections and certificates of occupancy or final inspection approval.

the state.

6. Being the subject of repeated complaints and investigations into code violations, incomplete work, refusal to complete work, etc., requiring repeated
intercession, investigation, or inspections, or the filing of claims against the contractor's surety company.
B. If a licensee commits any acts which violate, or fail to comply with, the terms of this chapter, that act or omission shall be deemed grounds for
revocation or suspension of the license and the following procedure shall be implemented, unless the public works director deems the situation serious
enough to warrant immediate suspension, in which case the provisions of subsection C of this section shall apply:
1. The licensee shall be notified, in writing by certified mail, or personal delivery if mail is refused, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the
impending suspension or revocation.

Chapter 15.32
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
15.32.005: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Idaho has in Idaho Code sections 46-1020 through 46-1024 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Pocatello does adopt this chapter,
including this section, and the following sections. (Ord. 2865 § 1, 2009)
15.32.010: PURPOSE:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 282/391
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions
in specific areas, by methods and provisions designed for:
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
D. Preventing and regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Prior code § 4-10-1)
15.32.020: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined in this section, words and phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the city engineer's interpretation of any provision of the ordinance codified herein or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three
feet (3'); a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is
characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the "100-year flood".
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal insurance administration has delineated both the areas of special flood
hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal insurance administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary floodway
map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
A. The overflow of inland and tidal waters; and/or
B. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that shall correspond to the elevation of the one percent (1%) chance flood (100-year flood) plus
any increased flood elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any required freeboard.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge and store the floodwater or
flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of section 15.32.140 of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also
includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance
purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent
or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle built on a single chassis, consisting of four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD: A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on
a particular stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 283/391
watershed or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every
one hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent (1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start"
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of tiles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. "Permanent construction"
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: The walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Work on structures that are determined to be
substantially damaged is considered to be substantial improvement, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
A. Before the improvement or repair is started; or
B. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions;
B. Any alteration of a structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
"Cumulative substantial improvement" shall be defined as any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure that equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure at the time of improvement or repair when counted cumulatively for five (5) years.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of the ordinance codified herein which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by the ordinance codified herein. (Ord. 2865 § 2, 2009: Ord. 2237 § 1, 1987)

water;
B. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
C. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting provisions of this section based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in subsection 15.32.080C of this chapter.
D. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection 15.32.140B of this chapter.
E. Applicants for floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1') below
the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as 1 foot below that level). (Ord. 2865 § 6, 2009: Ord. 2237
§§ 12, 13, 1987: prior code § 4-10-5.2(B))
15.32.160: SPECIFIC STANDARDS; MANUFACTURED HOMES:
All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE) and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system in accordance with the provisions of subsection 15.32.080B of this chapter. (Ord. 2865 § 7, 2009)
15.32.163: SPECIFIC STANDARDS; RECREATIONAL VEHICLES:

B. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or
C. Meet the requirements of section 15.32.160 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. 2865 § 8,
2009)
15.32.165: SPECIFIC STANDARDS; AE AND A1-30 ZONES WITH BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS BUT NO FLOODWAYS:
In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. (Ord. 2865 § 9, 2009)
15.32.170: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 15.32.030B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless a no rise certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge;
B. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of sections 15.32.070 through 15.32.180 of this chapter;
C. Prohibit the placement of any manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision. (Ord.
2865 § 10, 2009: Ord. 2237 § 15, 1987: prior code § 4-10-5.3)
15.32.180: SHALLOW FLOODING WAYS; WITH DEPTH DESIGNATIONS (AO ZONES):
Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet (3')
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 287/391
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:
A. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the flood protection elevation (FPE) (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified on
the FIRM).
B. New construction and substantial improvement of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:
1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE) (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified on the FIRM); or
2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as in subsection 15.32.150C of this chapter.
C. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 2865 § 11, 2009:
Ord. 2237 § 16, 1987)
15.32.200: VARIANCE:
In order to secure a variance from the requirements of this chapter in order to secure a building permit, an applicant for such a permit may follow the
variance procedures set forth in 44 CFR 60.6(a)(1-7), criteria for land management and use, variances and exceptions, three (3) copies of which are on file
in the office of the city engineer, which regulations are adopted by reference, and declared to be part of this chapter. (Ord. 2865 § 12, 2009)
15.32.210: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Prior code § 4-10-7)

Chapter 15.42
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND FACILITIES
15.42.010: FINDINGS:
The communications act of 1934 as amended by the telecommunications act of 1996 ("the act") grants the federal communications commission (FCC)
exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF) emissions from communications facilities and the regulation
of radio signal interference among users of the RF spectrum. The regulation of towers and communications facilities will not have the effect of prohibiting
any person from providing wireless communications services in violation of the act. (Ord. 2979, 2016: Ord. 2662, 2001)
15.42.020: PURPOSES:
A. The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of wireless communications facilities in order to protect
the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless
communications marketplace in the city.
B. Specifically, the purposes of this chapter are:
1. To regulate the location of wireless communications facilities in the city;
2. To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact of towers and other communications facilities;
3. To minimize adverse visual impact of wireless communications facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
4. To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single use wireless communications facilities;
5. To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of tower structures to support
antenna and communications facilities;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 297/391
6. To avoid potential damage to property caused by wireless communications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully designed,
constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; and
7. To ensure that wireless communications facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses to the greatest extent reasonably possible. (Ord. 2979,
2016: Ord. 2662, 2001)

15.42.080: TOWER SHARING, COLLOCATION, PREFERRED TOWER LOCATIONS AND STANDARDS:
A. Tower Sharing And Collocation: New WCF facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, collocate on existing towers or other structures of a similar
height to avoid construction of new towers, unless precluded by zoning constraints such as height, structural limitations, inability to obtain authorization
by the owner of an alternate location, or where an alternate location will not meet the service coverage objectives of the applicant.
B. New Towers: Applications for a new tower must address all existing towers or structures of a similar height within one-half (1/2) mile of the proposed site
as follows:
1. By providing evidence that a request was made to collocate on the existing tower or other structure, with no success; or
2. By showing that locating on the existing tower or other structure is infeasible with a detailed written explanation detailing why a new tower is
required.
C. Tower Height: Towers are exempt from the maximum height restrictions of the districts where located.
D. Tower Setback, Base Station And/Or Accessory Facilities: Setbacks are required based on the underlying zoning as measured from property lines to
the base of the tower. Setback requirements may be modified so that a tower can be placed so as to reduce its visual impact, e.g., adjacent to trees
which may partially hide the tower.
E. Separation: Towers shall be separated from all residentially zoned lands by a minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150').
F. Lighting: Facility lighting shall be designed so as to meet, but not exceed, minimum requirements for security, safety or FAA regulations. Lighting of
antennas or support structures shall be prohibited unless required by the FAA. All lighting shall be designed so as to avoid glare and minimize
illumination on adjacent properties and shall comply with all city regulations.
G. Easements And Lease Agreements1: The boundaries of easements and lease areas for cell towers need to be monumented and a record of survey
filed with the county.
H. Substantial Change: A modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of a tower or base station if it meets any of the following:
1. For towers outside of public rights of way ("ROW"), it increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent (10%) or by the height of one
additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet (20'), whichever is greater;
2. For towers in the ROW and all base stations, it increases the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent (10%) or ten feet (10'),
whichever is greater;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 302/391
3. For towers outside the ROW, it protrudes from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet (20'), or more than the width of the tower structure at the
level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater;
4. For towers in the ROW and all base stations, it protrudes from the edge of the structure more than six feet (6');
5. It involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4) cabinets;
6. It entails any excavation or deployment outside of the current site of the tower or base station;
7. It would defeat the existing concealment/camouflage elements of the tower or base station; or
8. It does not comply with conditions associated with the locality's prior zoning approval of construction or modification of the tower or base station,
unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in height, increase in width, addition of cabinets, or new excavation that does not exceed the
corresponding "substantial change" thresholds. (Ord. 2979, 2016)

occur. The purpose of these provisions is to establish a procedure for determining whether certain specific uses would have been permitted in a
zoning district had they been contemplated and whether such unlisted uses are compatible with or similar to the listed uses.
2. Process: The director shall render an interpretation, as governed by section 17.02.190 of this title.
3. Approval Standards: Approval or denial of an unlisted use application by the director shall be based on findings of whether:
a. The use is consistent with the intent and purpose of the applicable zoning district;
b. The use is similar to and of the same general type as the uses listed in the zoning district;
c. The use has similar impacts as the uses listed in the zoning district; and
d. The use has similar impacts on the community facilities as the uses listed in the zoning district. Community facilities include, but are not limited to,

17.01.170: ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS:
A. Nonconforming Situations: The purpose of this section is to bring nonconforming situations into conformance with this code and the comprehensive
plan, allowing them to continue only subject to the standards and requirements of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any lot,
land use, or structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or subsequent amendments thereto that does not comply with the standards
of this chapter shall be known as a legal nonconforming situation. Change of ownership, tenancy, or management personnel in a nonconforming
situation shall not affect its legal nonconforming status. The applicant, not the city of Pocatello, has the burden of proving that any nonconforming
situation was legally established.
1. Legal Nonconforming Lots: Lots or parcels legally created but which do not now conform to the legal lot standards of this code may be occupied by
uses otherwise permitted if those uses will comply with all other provisions of this code.
2. Legal Nonconforming Buildings/Structures: A building that was legally established but no longer conforms to all development standards of this title is
considered a legal nonconforming structure. Notwithstanding standards of this section, minor repairs and routine maintenance that do not increase
the nonconformity of a legal nonconforming structure are permitted. A legal nonconforming structure that is destroyed by fire or some other calamity,
not intentionally caused by the owner, may be replaced. In such case, the replacement structure shall not exceed the original dimensions or density
of the previous structure, unless through the replacement and expansion process outlined in subsection A2c of this section. Expansion or
reconstruction of legal nonconforming structures shall comply with the following:
a. Interior Remodeling: Interior remodeling which does not change the existing use or the extent of the nonconforming use shall be permitted.
b. Replacement; Expansion: Permits to replace or expand existing nonconforming structures by up to a total of fifty percent (50%) of the original
building area may be sought through the variance process regardless of the underlying zoning district. Any modification to bulk or placement of a
nonconforming structure, including increased building height or decreased setbacks, will require a variance.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 331/391
c. Criteria For Nonconforming Structure Expansion Or Replacement: Variance applications for expansion or replacement of a nonconforming
structure shall meet the following criteria:

(2) All bulk and placement standards such as height, setbacks, etc., shall be met, except as specifically varied through this process.
(3) The proposed development shall not adversely impact the public's health, safety, or general welfare and the visual appearance of the
development will not produce an effect inconsistent with adjacent and surrounding architecture and site development patterns.
3. Legal Nonconforming Uses: A use that was legally established but no longer complies with the allowed uses or restrictions of this title is considered
a legal nonconforming use. If the structure housing a legal nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or some other calamity, not intentionally caused by
the owner, it may be replaced and the use continued. In such case, the replacement structure shall not exceed nor the use intensify beyond the
original dimensions, density, or operational characteristics, unless through the expansion or change process outlined in subsection A3c of this
section.
a. Interior Remodeling: Interior remodeling to the building housing the legal nonconforming use, which does not change or intensify the
nonconforming use, shall be permitted.
b. Expansion: Permits to expand existing nonconforming uses by up to a total of fifty percent (50%) of the original building or land area or density
may be sought through the conditional use permit process regardless of the underlying zoning district. Further, any site modifications that could
change or intensify a nonconforming use such as, but not limited to, parking spaces, traffic circulation, ingress/egress, curb cut location,
landscaping removal, or similar items of change will require a conditional use permit.
c. Criteria For Nonconforming Use Expansion Or Change: Conditional use permit applications for expansion, change, or intensification of a
nonconforming use shall meet the following criteria:
(1) The lot or parcel was legally created.
(2) New development shall comply with the current standards set forth by this code, except as specifically varied through this process.
(3) The proposed expansion or change shall be designed to minimize potential impacts on public health, safety, and general welfare and shall be
within the following parameters:
(A) The degree of noise, vibration, dust, odor, fumes, glare, or smoke created by the use will not be increased;
(B) The number and kinds of vehicular trips associated with the use shall not be changed so as to cause additional impacts on surrounding
properties unless mitigating measures are taken;
(C) The amount and nature of outside storage, loading, and parking shall not be changed so as to cause increased adverse impacts;
(D) The visual appearance of the development shall be designed to be compatible with the adjacent and surrounding architecture and site
development patterns;
(E) The hours of operation shall not be increased unless specifically altered through this process and adverse impacts minimized.
d. Termination Of Nonconforming Uses: Legal nonconforming use status will be lost as prescribed by Idaho Code section 67-6538, or as amended.
4. Completion Of A Nonconforming Development: A development lawfully under construction, for which a permit has been issued, or for which a land
use application has been accepted on the date this chapter is adopted may be completed even if not in compliance with this chapter. The
development would be considered legal nonconforming and may be used for the purpose for which it was designed, approved, intended, and
arranged.
B. Proportionate Compliance: When a change in use is proposed for existing structures and/or site, proportionate compliance with parking and
landscaping standards set forth in this title shall be allowed. Proportionate compliance denotes the difference in these standards to the extent that use
or area is changed. These are outlined below:
Condition Status
New construction Full compliance
Replacement by conforming use Existing can remain
Replacement by nonconforming use Existing can remain
Expansion of conforming use <50% Proportionate compliance
Expansion of conforming use >50% Full compliance
Expansion of nonconforming use See subsections A2 and A3 of this section

17.02.130: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS (CUP):
A. Definition: Conditional uses are uses that are allowed within a zoning district provided that certain standards (or "conditions") are met that will enhance
the compatibility of the proposed use with other surrounding uses. Often conditional uses are unique and their effect on the surrounding environment
cannot be determined in advance of a specific proposal for a particular location. Application for a conditional use permit affords the city an opportunity
to review the location, design, configuration, and potential impact of the proposed use on surrounding land uses.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 333/391
B. Application: A CUP application shall be filed and include all information and fees outlined on the application form.
C. Hearings And Notices: Upon receipt of a complete conditional use permit application, a hearing date shall be set, notice of the hearing provided, and

the CUP process;
2. Is consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan of the city;
3. Is compatible with existing and permitted land uses within the general area;
4. Could be adequately served by public facilities and services such as thoroughfares, transportation facilities, police and fire protection, drainage,
refuse disposal, water/sewer and schools, to ensure that the proposed use would not be detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare;
5. Would be harmonious in scale, mass, coverage, density, and intensity with all adjacent permitted land uses;
6. Would not adversely affect the environment to a greater degree than had a use permitted outright by the ordinance been established;
7. Would not be detrimental to the public interests, health, safety, or welfare of the city in its proposed location, size, design, and operating
characteristics.
E. Authority To Grant: The hearing body may approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a conditional use permit. The decision may be
appealed by the applicant or other affected persons (according to the provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6521) to the city council, using the process
outlined in section 17.02.400, "Appeals", of this chapter. The hearing body may impose any conditions necessary to accomplish the following:

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 334/391
G. Conditional Use Permit Expiration: Uses for which a conditional use permit has been granted shall be established within one year from the date of
approval, including meeting all conditions, unless otherwise provided for in the CUP approval. Should the conditional use and conditions not be
established within this period of time or as provided in the CUP approval, the conditional use permit shall become null and void, unless the applicant
has been granted a time extension. In addition, a conditional use permit that has expired according to the provisions of this section shall not be
reestablished without a new conditional use permit being approved.
H. Time Extension: An applicant that has been granted a CUP may request a time extension that is not to exceed an additional one year period. The
director may grant the request if filed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the permit and provided the applicant demonstrates good cause for the
delay. Time extensions that are denied by the director may be appealed through the usual appeal process.
I. Conditional Use Permit To Run With The Land: Unless specifically amended in the approving document, a conditional use permit granted pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter shall continue for the approved use upon a change of property ownership.

17.02.140: LAND USE EXCEPTIONS:
A. Purpose: The land use exception process is established to allow applicants for an exception to land use standards and regulations to bypass the
conditional use permit, variance, or sign exception process, in the interests of time, complexity of application, and/or for the convenience of the
applicant. In the land use exception process, the public hearing is held before the City Council, rather than before the hearing examiner or Planning
and Zoning Commission. As with the standard conditional use permit, variance, and sign exception process, the land use exception process affords the
City an opportunity to review the location, design, configuration, and potential impact of the proposal on surrounding land uses.
B. Application: A land use exception application shall be filed and include all information and fees outlined on the application form.
C. Hearings And Notices: Upon receipt of a complete land use exception application, a hearing date shall be set, notice of the hearing provided, and
hearing held in the manner required by section 17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter.
D. Criteria For Review: Criteria for evaluation of land use exceptions shall be as outlined for the specific land use process from which an exception is
requested (see sections 17.02.130 and 17.02.170 of this chapter and section 15.20.270 of this Code).
E. Amendments To Approved Land Use Exceptions: Standards for evaluation of amendments to land use exceptions shall be as outlined for the specific
land use process from which an exception was obtained (see sections 17.02.130 and 17.02.170 of this chapter and section 15.20.270 of this Code).
(Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.02.150: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) is to facilitate a more flexible mixture of uses and developments. They are intended to
allow for greater localized density, to encourage clustered development for preservation of open spaces, to arranging living patterns in accordance with
good planning principles, and to provide adequate safeguards to protect the community.
B. Uses Permitted: The underlying zoning district indicated within a PUD will determine the principal uses permitted.
C. Criteria For Review: The facts and circumstances of each proposal shall be reviewed and written findings of fact that address the following criteria shall
be prepared:
1. The project provides alternative methods of land development;
2. The project includes a mix of land uses; these uses are compatible and well integrated even though they might otherwise be discouraged through
conventional zoning techniques;
3. The project conserves natural and topographic features;
4. The project promotes compatibility with adjacent land uses, established neighborhoods, and available public facilities;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 335/391
5. The project considers intensity of use including, but not limited to, building coverage, magnitude of activities, density, and traffic circulation/patterns;
6. The project emphasizes architectural design and aesthetic value; and
7. The project emphasizes provision of open spaces and quality recreation areas and facilities.
D. General Standards: The following standards shall apply to all proposed PUDs:
1. Ownership Or Unitary Control: A PUD shall be under single ownership or unified control throughout the entire planning stage and the completion of
all approved infrastructure to ensure that development is accomplished as planned. Proof of single ownership or unified control is required and may
be demonstrated by a deed showing a single owner, restrictive covenants of a property owners' association, or otherwise as approved by the city.
2. Integration: In the design process, particular effort shall be made to integrate a PUD proposal with the surrounding natural and built out environment.
Particular attention shall be paid to proposed traffic patterns, pedestrian circulation, surrounding land uses, and drainage patterns.
3. Subdivision Requirements: Any PUD that includes a subdivision of land shall comply with all standards set forth by the subdivision ordinance of the
city. Subdividing of land may not proceed until a proposed PUD has been approved.
4. Open Space: Regardless of the type of PUD, common open space shall encompass at least twenty percent (20%) of the net land area involved in
the development. Rights of way and areas included within private lots shall not be counted toward the required open space. The required common
open space shall include, but not be limited to, usable recreation areas and/or facilities (e.g., parks, clubhouses, athletic courts, pools, trails).
Land dedicated as open space shall be permanently maintained by either private covenants attached to and made part of the plan, or if suitable and
mutually agreeable to the applicant and the city, by public dedication. If open space is to be maintained through private covenants, the director may
require, prior to recording of any final plat, establishment of a homeowners' association and/or either:
a. Completed improvements, development, and dedication of open space features;
b. Posting of a bond sufficient to assure completion of improvements, development, and dedication of open space features.

designee prior to grading.
6. Time Frame: For any approved PUD, physical construction of approved infrastructure shall begin within three (3) years of final approval of the PUD.
Grading or landscaping does not constitute physical construction. Build-out of the PUD infrastructure shall be completed within five (5) years of final
approval. If not complete, the PUD becomes null and void and reapplication is required thereafter. If requested, the planning and zoning commission
may consider granting time extensions for the PUD time frames described herein. Extensions shall not exceed a one year period, and requests for
such extensions shall be received by the city at least three (3) months prior to the expiration date. These time limits may be as otherwise adjusted
and approved through the PUD process.

A. Definition: A variance is a modification of the bulk and placement requirements of this title as to lot size, lot coverage, lot width, lot depth; front yard, side
yard, rear yard setbacks; parking space requirements, height of buildings, or other ordinance provisions adversely affecting the development or use of
property. A variance shall not be considered a right or special privilege, but may be granted to an applicant only upon a showing of undue hardship
because of the characteristics of the site and that the variance is not in conflict with the public interest.
B. Application: A variance application shall be filed with planning and development services and include all required information and payment of fees listed
on the application form.
C. Hearings And Notices: Upon receipt of a complete variance application, a hearing date shall be scheduled, notice of the hearing will be provided, and a
hearing will be held in the manner required by section 17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter.
D. Applicability: A variance shall concern only the modification of a basic use permitted outright or other development regulation pertaining to the
applicable zoning district of the subject property under the current provisions of this title.
E. Authority To Grant: The hearing examiner may approve, approve with conditions, or modification, or deny an application for a variance. The decision
may be appealed by the applicant or other affected persons according to the provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6521. Said appeal is to the city
council pursuant to the process outlined in section 17.02.400, "Appeals", of this chapter.

fact that address all of the following criteria:
1. The applicant shall have taken all reasonable steps to comply with the strict terms of the ordinance from which he or she requests the variance.
2. The variance sought must be the result of unusual physical characteristics of the site in question.
3. The circumstances surrounding the variance request shall be due to an undue hardship as related to the characteristics of the land, and the
applicant shall show that, absent a variance, he/she would be deprived of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the identical zoning district
under the terms of this title.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 339/391
4. The undue hardship cited as the basis of a variance request did not result from the actions of the applicant, or the current, or a prior landowner, or
any of their agents.
5. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed variance does not adversely affect adjacent/nearby property.
G. Precedents: The granting of a prior variance or referencing property developed under prior regulations is not admissible evidence for the granting of a
new variance. Each request for a variance shall be judged on its own facts and circumstances.
H. Burden Of Proof: The burden of proof that the proposed variance complies with all of the variance criteria as described under subsection F of this
section is the responsibility of the applicant. The applicant must support their case with substantial and competent evidence.
I. Variance Expiration: Authorization for an approved variance shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of approval. The applicant must initiate
implementation of the approved variance within one year from the date of approval. The approval shall become null and void in the event
implementation of the variance and all conditions is not initiated within said one year period. A variance permit that has expired prior to implementation
shall not be reestablished without a new variance being approved. The time period for an approved permit may be extended subject to subsection J of
this section.
J. Time Extension: An applicant who has been granted a variance may request a time extension that is not to exceed an additional six (6) month period. A
request for a time extension must be submitted in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the approved variance permit. The director
may grant the request provided the applicant demonstrates good cause for the extension of the approved permit. Only one extension may be granted.
A time extension request that is denied by the director may be appealed pursuant to section 17.02.400 of this chapter.
K. Administrative Variance: The director may approve the modification of a setback, building height, lot coverage, or building footprint size requirement of
this title by up to ten percent (10%) subject to the following requirements:
1. The applicant must provide written consent from all adjoining property owners of record, signified by the owner's signature on a form provided by
planning and development services.
2. The consent form shall clearly describe the nature of the proposed variance request and state that the property owner, by signing the form, is
consenting to the variance request.
3. If any of the adjoining owners fail to sign the consent form, then the administrative variance cannot be processed.
4. If the applicant fails to obtain all the required signatures they may, at their own discretion, submit a variance application pursuant to this section.

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 340/391
6. Whether the proposed zoning designation is consistent with the comprehensive plan land use map designation.
F. Criteria For Zoning Ordinance Text Amendment: The planning and zoning commission and the city council shall review the facts and circumstances of a
proposed amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance based on all of the following standards:
1. The proposed text amendment would be in the community's best interest.

3. The proposed text amendment is consistent with existing provisions of the comprehensive plan.
G. Planning And Zoning Commission Action: After notice, the planning and zoning commission shall hold a hearing to consider the request and render a
recommendation. The commission shall submit findings of fact and recommendations to the city council within forty five (45) days following closure of
the public hearing.
H. City Council Action: The city council shall hold a public hearing (as prescribed under section 17.02.300 of this chapter) within forty five (45) days of
receipt of the planning and zoning commission's recommendation. Following official closure of the public hearing the council shall issue their findings
within forty five (45) days of the hearing's closure.
I. Limitation On Resubmission: If the city council adopts a zoning classification pursuant to a request by a property owner that is consistent with the
adopted comprehensive plan, the council shall not subsequently reverse its action or otherwise change the zoning classification of said property
without the consent in writing of the current property owner for a period of four (4) years from the date of adoption of said individual property owner's
request for a zoning district classification change, per Idaho Code 67-6511(d). Rezoning requests which have been rejected may not be refiled for
twelve (12) months following city council action unless the council specifically waives the reapplication waiting period.
J. Contract-Zoning Agreements:
1. Appropriate Circumstances: As an alternative to denying a requested zoning or rezoning, when the city council deems such zoning or change of
zoning to be inappropriate for an area due to the nature and variety of uses allowed in the requested zoning district and their impacts on the real
property in question and the surrounding properties, the city council may elect to allow a specific project with a specific use and/or development
scheme by terms of a contract-zoning agreement. Approval of any such agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to
conditionally zone or rezone the land solely for the uses set out in the agreement, provided all terms and provisions of the zoning contract are fully
met.
2. Contract Option For Zoning Or Rezoning Requests: A contract-zoning agreement may be permitted or required at the discretion of the city council for
the zoning or rezoning of any parcel(s) of property upon application of the owner or developer of the property, upon recommendation of the director,
upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, or upon the council's own motion. Recommendation or decision to proceed by means
of contract-zoning agreement may occur at any stage in the zoning or rezoning process.
3. Standards For Use Of Zoning Contracts: The execution of a contract-zoning agreement may be required in order for any project or zoning
designation to proceed if, in the opinion of the city council, the project and/or zone contemplated is an appropriate use for the real property in
general, but the zoning designation requested or required would allow undesirable or inappropriate land uses or development schemes for the real
property in question or for the surrounding area, whether due to the nature of the use itself or due to its impacts on the surrounding area.
4. Procedures For Establishing Contract-Zoning Agreement Conditions: If the director determines that a contract-zoning agreement is appropriate for
any zoning/rezoning request, he or she may recommend execution of such an agreement and forward such recommendation, along with proposed
conditions, to the planning and zoning commission for consideration at its public hearing on the zoning/rezoning request. The applicant and/or the
planning and zoning commission may also recommend this contract-zoning agreement procedure and propose conditions. The planning and zoning
commission shall, after public hearing on the zoning/rezoning request, present its recommendation to the city council for: a) approval of a contractzoning
agreement with suggested conditions, or b) for outright approval of the zoning/rezoning request without execution of any agreement, or c) for
denial of the request. At any stage of the proceedings, an applicant may propose conditions for the agreement and shall be given opportunity to
comment on proposed conditions.
5. Form And Content Of Agreement: In the event a contract-zoning agreement is deemed appropriate by the city council, the developer or owner shall
execute an agreement with the city that shall be reviewed and approved for form by the city attorney prior to final council action. The agreement shall
contain the provisions set out below, and once executed by the developer/owner, shall be presented to council for its approval. Minimum provisions
shall include:
a. Identification of use(s) to be allowed under the agreement.
b. Identification of development standards that shall be required under the agreement.
c. Planned implementation of improvements and planned construction/completion schedule.
d. Required surety for project completion if abandoned or otherwise uncompleted.
e. A provision that the owner/developer acknowledges and agrees that failure to comply with the terms of the agreement shall result in a rezoning of
the real property to the zoning district existing immediately prior to the execution of the agreement.
f. A provision specifying that the agreement and all conditions, terms, duties, and obligations included in said agreement shall be an encumbrance on
the real property and shall run with the land.
g. Any other matter required by the city council.
6. City Council Approval: Contract-zoning agreements may be approved at the sole discretion of the city council following a public hearing before the
council on the related zoning/rezoning application. Following the hearing, the council shall set out the conditions it deems appropriate for inclusion in
the contract-zoning agreement, which shall be prepared by the city attorney's office for execution by the developer/owner, and submitted to the
council for final approval and execution within thirty (30) days of the public hearing. Provided, however, that no such agreement shall become
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 341/391
effective until adoption and publication of the zone change ordinance. Following approval and execution by all parties of the contract-zoning
agreement, the city clerk shall cause said agreement to be recorded in the office of the Bannock County clerk and recorder.
7. Duty To Comply: The owner(s), co-owner(s), developer(s), agent(s) of owner or developer, assignee(s) of owner(s) or developer(s) and all
subsequent owners or developers of the real property that is encumbered by the contract-zoning agreement shall comply with all conditions, terms,
obligations, and duties contained in said agreement. Failure to comply shall result in withholding of certificates of occupancy, execution of "stop work"
orders, discontinuance of water service, and/or subject the real property to the provisions set out in the enforcement section that follows.
8. Modification Of Contract-Zoning Agreement: Modifications to contract-zoning agreements may be made at the sole discretion of the city council upon
application of the owner/developer to the planning and development services department, after public hearing on the matter with notification to the
owner/developer and general public as provided by state law and the provisions of section 17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public
Hearings", of this chapter. Provided, however, that no application for modification may be accepted if the request is to allow a use that is not an
outright or conditionally permitted use under the terms of the zoning ordinance for the zone established by the contract-zoning agreement.
9. Consideration Of Termination Of Contract And Reversion Of Zone:
a. Public Hearing: Upon notification to the city council by the director of noncompliance of a contract-zoning agreement, the council shall establish a
date for a public hearing on said noncompliance. Written notice of said hearing shall be published in the local newspaper fifteen (15) days prior to
the hearing and mailed to the owner/developer at his last known address. After the public hearing the city council shall adopt a written decision
with appropriate findings, specifying whether the owner/developer is in compliance and continuing the agreement or whether the owner/developer
is in noncompliance and terminating the agreement.
b. Effect Of Termination: In the event the agreement is terminated, the city council shall adopt an ordinance reverting the subject real property to its
previous land use zoning district. All uses that are not consistent with the zoning district established by said ordinance shall cease and shall not be
considered as legal nonconforming uses. The water service to the premises of said uses may be discontinued unless the owner/developer is
applying for a conditional use permit for uses which are allowable by such permit under the zone established by said ordinance. If a conditional
use permit is denied, the use shall cease, and water service may be terminated and not reinstated until a lawful use is established on the
premises, and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for structures unless a lawful use of said structures is verified through the planning and
development services department.
10. Enforcement: Contract-zoning agreements may be enforced by the city through any means deemed to be appropriate, including, but not limited to,
specific enforcement, termination of water service, injunctive relief, monetary damages, criminal penalties, and/or termination. Such enforcement
options shall not be considered exclusive, but may be combined as deemed appropriate. (Ord. 2931, 2014: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)

3. Form: The interpretation shall be in writing and shall be sent or delivered to the applicant at the applicant's address on the request for interpretation.
Interpretations that are not in writing shall have no force or effect. Interpretations shall be made on a case by case basis and have no precedential
value. Interpretations shall be limited in their application to the property specifically identified.
4. Official Record: The director shall maintain an official record of all interpretations in the department. Such official record shall be available for public
inspection during normal business hours upon written request.
5. Appeal: Appeals of any interpretation under this section shall be made in accordance with section 17.02.400, "Appeals", of this chapter.
D. Rules For Interpretation Of Boundaries: Interpretations regarding boundaries of zoning districts on the official zoning map shall be made in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
1. District Regulations Extend To All Portions Of District: Except as otherwise specifically provided, a district symbol or name shown within district
boundaries on the official zoning map indicates that district standards and other district regulations pertaining to the district extend throughout the
whole area surrounded by the boundary line.
2. Boundaries: Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
a. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of dedicated streets, highways, alleys or rights of way shall be construed as
following such centerlines as they exist on the ground, except where such interpretation would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which
case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. In case of a street vacation,
the boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except where ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center, in
which case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership.
b. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, public property lines, etc., shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however,
that where such boundaries are adjacent to a dedicated street, alley, highway, or right of way and the zoning status of the street, highway, alley, or
right of way is not indicated, the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street, highway, alley, or right of way. In the event of
street vacation, interpretation shall be as provided in subsection D2a of this section.

c. Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limits.
d. Boundaries indicated as following the centerlines of streams, canals, or other bodies of water shall be construed as following such centerlines. In
case of a change of the course or extent of bodies of water, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the change, except where such
movement would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel; and in such case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid
changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel.
e. Boundaries indicated as following physical features other than those listed above shall be construed as following such physical features, except
where such interpretation from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary shall be interpreted
in such manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel.
f. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections D2a through D2e of this section shall be construed as being
parallel to or extensions of such features.
g. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map on the page of the official zoning map
showing the property in question.
E. Division Of A Lot Of Record By A Boundary: Where a district boundary divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established, and where the
division makes impractical the reasonable use of the lot, the boundary may be adjusted by the director in either direction not to exceed fifty feet (50')
beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
F. Nonregulated Land Transfers: Abutting portions of lots may be transferred to adjoining property owners without being subject to subdivision
requirements; provided, however, that no such transfer shall imply or confer any right to develop, or create a new lot, create or increase a
nonconformity of any nature whatsoever, or circumvent the intent or requirements of this code. (Note: This type of transfer is commonly known as a "lot
line adjustment" even though the platted lot lines are not changed and cannot be changed except through platting.) (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)

7. All land use and development matters subject to hearing examiner or planning and zoning commission review.
C. Information Required: All proposals for land use and development approvals must follow the appropriate protocol procedures and provide all information
required by the protocols adopted and in use at the time the application is submitted. For land use and development proposals which require special
permitting (subdivisions, rezoning requests, planned unit developments, annexation requests, conditional use permits, and variances), the appropriate
land use application form and all materials required of that application also must be submitted by the deadlines as established by the director. (Ord.

Chapter 17.03
ZONING DISTRICTS
17.03.100: ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS:
A. Zoning Map: The boundaries of zoning districts are hereby established as shown on a map entitled the "Zoning Map Of The City Of Pocatello, Idaho".
The map may be periodically amended and is hereby made a part of this title by reference. Where uncertainty exists regarding a zoning district
boundary, an interpretation shall be made in accordance with section 17.02.190 of this title.
B. Zoning Districts And Standards: The zoning districts and standards set forth in this title are the development standards and requirements that apply to
land located within a specified zoning district. The standards are organized by zoning district and specify the purpose of each zoning district, the uses
allowed in each district, and other standards and criteria that apply. Unless otherwise noted, the standards contained in this chapter are declared to be
minimum standards. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.03.200: RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS:
17.03.210: PURPOSE:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 348/391
A. Residential zoning districts are established to promote the orderly development and maintenance of livable, peaceful and attractive neighborhoods
where residents can live their home life with a minimum of disturbance and disruption. Residential neighborhoods are to be developed to be pedestrian
friendly. Only such uses as may not interfere unreasonably with the enjoyment of normal home activities shall be permitted. Standards are designed to
encourage residential development and nonresidential development (schools, churches, parks and recreation facilities, daycare centers, neighborhood
commercial uses, and other services) that are compatible. Nonresidential development is to be at appropriate locations and scale.
B. Another purpose of these regulations is to create an environment in which construction of a full range of owner occupied and rental housing at
affordable prices is encouraged. This can be accomplished by providing residential zoning districts of varying densities, encouraging innovative design,
and providing reasonable development standards to encourage construction of affordable housing. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.03.220: LIST OF RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS:
A. Residential Estate District (RE): The RE zoning district is designed primarily to accommodate detached single-family dwellings with or without
accessory residential units at a minimum lot size of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet and larger. Open space, park lands, and neighborhood

17.03.300: COMMERCIAL AND MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS:
17.03.310: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the commercial and mixed use zoning districts is to provide range of commercial services for community residents. Commercial and mixed
use zoning districts are intended to promote the availability of a full range of retail and office uses that are available throughout the city, so that residents
can fulfill all or most of their needs within easy driving, walking and/or biking distance of their homes. The location of each commercial district shall be
carefully selected, and designed according to development standards created to minimize the potential adverse impacts of commercial activity on
established residential areas. Mixed use areas are intended to include residential, commercial and institutional activities, and may be located in new and
redeveloping commercial areas. A further purpose of these regulations is to promote a full range of economic activities and job opportunities within the city
limits, in compliance with the economic goals of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.03.320: LIST OF ZONING DISTRICTS:
A. Neighborhood Commercial District (NC): The NC zoning district is designed to provide convenient shopping facilities to meet the regular needs of
nearby residential neighborhoods. With a service area of about one and one-half (1.5) miles, such commercial centers typically range in size from ten
thousand (10,000) to forty thousand (40,000) gross square feet on sites less than five (5) acres. Separated from other commercially zoned areas by at
least one-half (1/2) mile, community commercial centers are intended to serve several residential neighborhoods, ideally at the intersection of two (2) or
more major collector streets or at the intersection of an arterial and collector street. Housing is permitted in this district provided buildings maintain
ground floor commercial storefronts. Residential density shall not exceed eight (8) units per net acre, i.e., the maximum density permitted in the RMM
zone district. A limited number of higher intensity uses, including, but not limited to, car washes, gas stations, religious institutions, and parking lots, are
conditionally permitted. In addition to mandatory site development review, design guidelines and development standards in the NC zoning district have
been adopted to ensure that developments will be well integrated, attractively landscaped, and promote pedestrian travel to neighborhood services
within close proximity.
B. Commercial General District (CG): The CG zoning district is designed to accommodate a full range of retail, office and civic uses with a citywide and/or
regional trade area. Residential uses are permitted provided that buildings maintain ground floor commercial storefronts. A wide range of higher
intensity uses, including, but not limited to, self-service storage, utilities, heliports, and major event entertainment, are conditionally permitted.
C. Residential/Commercial/Professional District (RCP): The RCP zoning district is intended to accommodate a mix of residential, professional office, and
neighborhood commercial uses including business/professional services, convenience retail, personal services, and restaurants, in close proximity to
residential areas and major transportation facilities. Residential uses are permitted consistent with the density and requirements of the RH zoning
district. Heliports, medical centers, and some utilities are conditionally permitted. Developments in the RCP zoning district may be used to serve as a
buffer between residential areas and commercial and/or industrial areas.
D. Central Commercial District (CC): The CC zoning district is designed to provide a concentrated central business district, centered on the city's historic
downtown, including a mix of civic, retail, and office uses. Residential uses are permitted provided buildings maintain ground floor commercial
storefronts. A wide range of uses, including, but not limited to, facilities with drive-up windows, major event entertainment facilities, and gasoline
stations, are conditionally permitted. Some properties in the central commercial zoning district are further subject to the standards of the historic
preservation overlay (see section 17.04.210 of this title). (Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.03.330: USES:
A. Types Of Uses: For the purposes of this chapter, there are four (4) kinds of uses:
1. A permitted use (P) is one that is permitted outright, but subject to all of the applicable provisions of this title. If a use is not listed as a permitted use,
it may be held to be a similar unlisted use under the provisions of section 17.01.160 of this title;
2. A restricted use (R) is permitted outright providing it is in compliance with special requirements, exceptions or restrictions, in addition to the
applicable provisions of this title;
3. A conditional use (C) is permitted only upon approval of a conditional use permit (CUP) application by the hearing examiner or planning and zoning
commission. The approval process and criteria are set forth in sections 17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings" and 17.02.130,
"Conditional Use Permits (CUP)", of this title. A use not listed as a conditional use may be held to be a similar use under the provisions of section
17.01.160, "Use Classifications", of this title;
4. A nonpermitted use (N) is a use that is not permitted in the specified zoning district under any circumstances, unless granted an exception by the
Pocatello city council.
B. Use Table: A list of permitted, restricted, conditional and nonpermitted uses in commercial and mixed use zoning districts is presented in table
17.03.330 of this section. All nonlisted uses shall be considered nonpermitted unless they are interpreted to be a similar use per section 17.01.160 of
this title.

17.03.400: INDUSTRIAL AND EMPLOYMENT ZONING DISTRICTS:
17.03.410: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the industrial and employment zoning districts is to designate areas where a range of industrial services and employment for city residents
are permitted. The regulations governing development in industrial and employment zoning districts are to ensure that a full range of job opportunities is
available throughout the city so that residents can work close to home if they choose. Design guidelines and development standards are established to
minimize the potential adverse impacts of industrial activity on residential areas. A further purpose of these regulations is to ensure that there is a full
range of economic activities and job opportunities within the city limits, in compliance with the economic development goals of the comprehensive plan.
(Ord. 2896, 2011)
17.03.420: LIST OF ZONING DISTRICTS:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 357/391
A. Office Park District (OP): The OP zoning district provides appropriate locations for combining light industrial, office, business, research and
development activities, and secondary small scale commercial uses that serve the employees and businesses in the office park zone, e.g., hotels,
restaurants, daycare, personal services and fitness centers, in a campus like setting. Only those light industrial uses with no off site impacts, e.g.,
noise, glare, odor, vibration, are permitted in the OP zoning district. In addition to mandatory site development review, design and development
standards in the OP zoning district have been adopted to ensure that developments will be well integrated, attractively landscaped, and promote
pedestrian travel.
B. Light Industrial District (LI): The LI zoning district provides appropriate locations for general industrial uses including industrial service, light industrial
production, research and development, warehousing and freight movement, and wholesale sales activities with minimal impacts on neighboring
properties due to nuisance characteristics such as noise, glare, odor, and vibration.
C. Industrial District (I): The I zoning district provides appropriate locations for intensive industrial uses including industrial service, manufacturing and
production, warehousing and freight movement, railroad yards, waste related, and wholesale sales activities. Activities in the I district include those
which involve the use of raw materials, require significant outdoor storage and generate heavy truck and/or rail traffic. Because of these characteristics,
industrially zoned property should be carefully located to minimize impacts on established residential, commercial, and light industrial areas. (Ord. 2846
§ 1, 2008)
17.03.430: USES:
A. Types Of Uses: For the purposes of this chapter, there are four (4) kinds of uses:
1. A permitted use (P) is one that is permitted outright, but subject to all of the applicable provisions of this title. If a use is not listed as a permitted use,
it may be interpreted to be a similar unlisted use under the provisions of section 17.01.160 of this title;
2. A restricted use (R) is permitted outright providing it is in compliance with special requirements, exceptions or restrictions;
3. A conditional use (C) is permitted only upon approval of a conditional use permit (CUP) application by the hearing examiner or the planning and
zoning commission. The approval process and criteria are set forth in sections 17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", and
17.02.130, "Conditional Use Permits (CUP)", of this title. A use not listed as a conditional use may be held to be a similar use under the provisions of
section 17.01.160, "Use Classifications", of this title;
4. A nonpermitted use (N) is a use that is not permitted in the specified zoning district under any circumstances, unless granted an exception by the
Pocatello city council.
B. Use Table: A list of permitted, restricted, conditional and nonpermitted uses in industrial zoning districts is presented in table 17.03.430 of this section.
Uses not listed shall be considered prohibited unless interpreted as a similar use per section 17.01.160 of this title.

Chapter 17.04
OVERLAY AREAS
17.04.100: RESOURCE PROTECTION OVERLAY (RPO):
17.04.110: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the RPO is to implement goals and objectives contained in the comprehensive plan related to protection of the area's important
environmental resources, such as significant natural and archaeological features, water resources, and wildlife winter range and migration corridors, while
still allowing property development in a manner consistent with its zoning designation and in a manner that offers the best protection possible to the
designated resources. This overlay establishes procedures to enable the applicant and city to achieve the mutually compatible objectives of reasonable
use of land and protection of vital resources. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.120: APPLICABILITY:
The provisions of this overlay shall apply to all development that may physically alter lands located within the resource protection overlay as designated on
the official city of Pocatello zoning map, comprehensive plan natural features overlay map, and/or other maps as referenced and incorporated or as
amended. All development plans shall be designed to reduce potential disturbance to any protected resources, through the use of buffers, conservation
easements, and creative land development techniques. The overlay specifically applies to designated natural and archaeological features; wildlife habitat
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 362/391
protection areas; streams and other open waters, including the Portneuf River; wetlands; and riparian areas. Each area of protection shall be designated
on the appropriate map by means of outlining, color change, etc. In the event of overlapping standards the most restrictive shall apply. The boundary lines
of any specified areas shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on each applicable map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of the line or where there appears to be a conflict between the mapped boundary and actual field conditions, an interpretation may be requested
according to the terms of section 17.02.190 of this title. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.130: LAND ANNEXATIONS:
Because of the importance of land located in the RPO, in the event of application for annexation, the city may request the opportunity to obtain a
conservation easement for the purposes stated in section 17.04.110 of this chapter, as deemed appropriate by the Pocatello city council. (Ord. 2846 § 1,
2008)
17.04.140: REVIEW REQUIRED:
All development affecting lands within the RPO shall be reviewed in accordance with the site plan procedures set forth in section 17.02.500, "Site Plan
Review Committee", of this title. A preapplication conference is required for all land development applications with an RPO designation. The conference
shall be used to determine the applicability of the provisions of this chapter; determine the need for specific studies as set out in this chapter; and identify
the review process. No activity shall be undertaken until all appropriate permits have been obtained. Approval for subdivisions and/or other land
development activities shall not be granted unless the applicant has complied with the requirements set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.150: WATER RESOURCE STANDARDS:
A. Purpose: Standards relating to protection of the area's water resources are designed to help resolve conflicts between development and conservation of
significant city wetlands, streams, and riparian corridors. The intent of this section is to allow reasonable economic use of property while establishing
clear and objective standards to:
1. Protect significant wetlands and streams;
2. Manage development in designated riparian corridors;
3. Maintain and enhance water quality;
4. Preserve native plant cover;
5. Encourage stream bank protection from erosion;
6. Maintain and enhance fish and wildlife habitats; and
7. Conserve scenic, recreational, and educational values of water resource areas identified in this chapter.
B. General Provisions: All applications for development that may impact designated water resources shall be subject to review by the site plan review
committee. A permit shall be required for all structures and all development, including grading, excavation, fill, and other activities; except that no city
permit shall be required for allowed vegetation management (state or federal permits may still be required). The appropriate permit shall be obtained
before construction or development begins in an area or on a parcel affecting delineated water resources within the RPO. An application shall not be
deemed complete until the applicant has addressed all applicable development standards. For construction or development in significant riparian
corridors, the permit application shall include an erosion control plan that identifies the specific measures to be implemented before, during, and after
construction to protect the riparian area and adjacent upland areas from erosion, siltation, and the effects of deleterious construction materials.
C. Applicability: The provisions of this section shall apply to all development that may physically alter lands identified as protected water resources,
including open water, significant wetlands, and riparian corridors, as designated on the official city of Pocatello zoning map, comprehensive plan natural
features overlay map, national wetland inventory (NWI) maps, and/or other maps as referenced and incorporated or as amended. Riparian corridors
within the city include, but are not limited to, the Portneuf River and its tributaries.
D. Setback Requirements:
1. Significant Wetlands: A minimum fifty foot (50') setback shall be maintained from the edge of all wetlands identified on either city of Pocatello zoning
or comprehensive plan maps and/or NWI maps. Site specific delineations may be necessary to determine the exact location of the boundary of the
significant wetland. Qualified individuals using a method acceptable to the U.S. army corps of engineers (COE) shall perform site specific
delineations. Where a wetland delineation is prepared, the mapping it contains shall replace that of the NWI for the purposes of this section.
2. Significant Riparian Corridors: A minimum fifty foot (50') setback shall be maintained from the edge of all riparian corridors identified on city of
Pocatello zoning or comprehensive plan maps, except for channelized portions of the Portneuf River (see subsection 17.04.160E of this chapter). A
significant riparian corridor shall consist of the water area and banks of the riparian area. Where a significant riparian corridor includes all or portions
of a significant wetland, the width shall be measured from the farthermost edge of the wetland and/or riparian area.
E. Restricted Uses And Activities: The following uses and activities shall be restricted in significant wetlands, significant aquifer areas, associated buffers
and significant riparian corridors, and shall not be undertaken without the appropriate review and approval per city, state, and/or federal regulations.
1. Excavation solely for the purpose of removal of gravel, aggregate, sand, minerals, or other inorganic or organic materials shall not be permitted;
2. Removal of native plant species without approved replacement or mitigation;
3. Placement of new structures or impervious surfaces not associated with permitted development;

4. Grading and placement of fill not associated with permitted development;
5. Application or use of pesticides, herbicides, soil amendments, or fertilizers;
6. The placement of garbage, lawn or yard debris, or other unauthorized materials; and
7. Storage of materials detrimental to water quality including, but not limited to, caustic substances, acidic substances, petroleum products, herbicides,
pesticides, etc., in quantities greater than fifty (50) gallons, unless a containment plan has been submitted to and approved by the designated city
official.
F. Development Standards:
1. General: In addition to the standards of the underlying zoning district, the following standards shall apply to all uses and activities potentially affecting
designated water resources. If a conflict occurs between these standards and the underlying zoning district or other terms of this chapter or this
code, the more restrictive standards shall apply. Development may also be subject to specific standards in subsequent sections of this chapter.
2. Standards:
a. Within fifty feet (50') of any protected water resource, excavation and vegetation removal shall be prohibited on slopes of twenty five percent
(25%) or greater, except where necessary to construct public facilities or to improve slope stability;
b. Cuts and/or fills, when permitted, shall be subject to the following standards:
(1) All fill material shall be clean and free of contaminants, such as any inorganic matter (concrete slabs, rebar, etc.) and significant organic matter
(tree limbs, refuse, waste debris, etc.);
(2) Cuts and/or fills shall be designed in a manner that does not increase the potential for flooding on adjacent or nearby flood prone lands, and
avoids restricting the flow of water to or through other land and protected resources; and
(3) Cut and/or fill slopes shall be revegetated within the immediate growing season with native plant species or approved alternatives according to
a city approved revegetation plan to stabilize the slopes.
G. Vegetation Management Standards: Planting of new vegetation within a significant wetland, associated buffers, or riparian corridor shall be permitted in

17.04.230: RESIDENTIAL STABILIZATION OVERLAY (RSO):
Because of changing surroundings, certain established residential areas require special attention to both their existing and future land uses. These
residential neighborhoods and street corridors are identified on the development overlay map of the comprehensive plan because encroachment of
nonresidential uses could adversely affect established neighborhoods. Therefore, those residential areas for which a change from established land uses
could prove detrimental to a particular corridor, neighborhood, or its surrounding neighborhood shall be given a residential stabilization overlay designation
(RSO). The emphasis for areas designated RSO shall be maintenance and rehabilitation of existing structures in a manner consistent with the existing
zoning designation. Therefore, existing structures shall not be removed unless it is determined by the building official that such creates danger to the
public's health, safety, and general welfare.
A. Zoning District Amendments: No zoning district change may be considered for lands designated RSO unless preceded by a request to amend the city's
comprehensive plan land use map.
B. Conditional Use Permits: Conditional use permits for nonresidential use types can be requested only on lands vacant at the time of adoption of this
code or in structures not originally constructed or used for residential purposes.
C. Nonresidential Uses: Nonresidential uses in residential zoning districts, including parking lots for uses permitted in residential zoning districts, shall not
be permitted.
D. Applicability: The provisions of the RSO are to be applied in conjunction with the provisions of the underlying zoning district and any other applicable
overlay areas. Where the provisions of the RSO and other standards conflict, the requirements of the RSO shall apply. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
17.05.100: SLOPE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
17.05.110: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the slope development standards is to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants by establishing
standards for development in sloped areas within the city of Pocatello. The standards are also intended to protect and maintain the scenic beauty of the
hillsides within and surrounding the community. The standards are intended to encourage development that is compatible with the character of existing
topography and existing vegetation. Sloped lands possess different characteristics than flat lands; therefore it is necessary to impose special regulations to
minimize slope and soil instability, erosion, sedimentation, and water runoff, and to protect the water quality and the natural character of sloped areas. The
purpose of these standards is to:
A. Preserve open space surrounding and within the city by encouraging development in less steep areas and by encouraging clustering.
B. Protect steeper slopes from excessive grading and overdevelopment.
C. Control, manage, and minimize erosion.
D. Provide for specialized review of development proposals in more steeply sloped areas to identify potential geologic hazards.
E. Assess uses and activities on sloped lands that may adversely affect slope stability.
F. Assess uses and activities on sloped lands that may adversely affect water resources.
G. Promote the preservation of the scenic character of hillsides.
H. Maintain the visual asset of hillsides by limiting cuts, fill, retaining walls, escarpments, and vegetation removal. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.120: APPLICABILITY:
A. Steep Slopes And Potentially Hazardous Area: The provisions of this section shall apply to all development regardless of zoning designation where
topographical slopes in excess of fifteen percent (15%) as exist as of the date of adoption hereof and/or when areas are identified as potentially
hazardous by a licensed geologist, geological report, or inventory of hazards. If a conflict occurs between this chapter and other standards of this code,
the more restrictive shall apply.
B. Review Required: All development of lands where the topographical slope exceeds fifteen percent (15%) shall be reviewed in accordance with the site
plan review procedures set forth in section 17.02.200 of this title. For all such lands, the requirements of this section shall be met prior to city approval
of any development activities, including, but not limited to:

17.05.140: SITE AND BUILDING DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
This section defines applicable site and building development guidelines.
A. Site Plan And Building Design:
1. Areas disturbed by grading (e.g., cut and fill) shall be kept to a minimum.
2. Development shall be concentrated on slopes less than fifteen percent (15%) on the site, with slopes of greater than fifteen percent (15%) remaining
undisturbed to the extent possible. Maximum disturbance of the site development area shall be as set out in table 17.05.140 of this section.
3. Whenever possible, structures shall be located on the natural slope of the land or on previously disturbed areas, rather than manmade pads or
terraces.
4. Development shall be clustered to preserve existing topographic features and vegetative cover.
5. A building location shall be designated on every lot with a natural slope of fifteen percent (15%) or greater. All building permit applications for
structures on such lots shall be accompanied by a geotechnical assessment. Building locations should be designed to address identified hazards,
minimize runoff and erosion, and utilize the existing slope. Special types of building construction, such as split pad and stepped foundations, shall be
used to minimize site disturbance and ensure that development conforms to the land.
6. Native vegetation shall be retained to the extent possible, even in identified setback areas, except where required to provide a defensible space to
minimize threat of wildfires.
7. Use of reflective building materials shall be avoided.
8. Where retaining walls or other structures are used to stabilize cuts or fills, their design should follow the natural contours of the slope. Plans for
proposed retaining walls or structures greater than four feet (4') in height shall be accompanied by engineered drawings meeting adopted building
codes. Multiple wall groupings shall have at least equal lateral run to vertical rise.
B. Site Disturbance And Density Standards:
1. Projects On Steeply Sloped Lands: Projects on steeply sloped lands shall have limited density and site disturbance based on the existing
topographical slope for the site or any portion of a site according to the standards listed in table 17.05.140 of this section.
TABLE 17.05.140
DENSITY AND DISTURBANCE STANDARDS
Slope Class
(Percent)

standards
15.0 to 24.9 50 50 25
25.0 to 34.9 25 25 10
35.0 and over 10 10 10
Note:
1. "Maximum percent of site disturbance" means the total disturbed area of alteration to the ground of the entire lot or parcel resulting from
temporary and permanent construction activities. Maximum percent of site disturbance does not imply that lot coverage can equal site disturbance.
See the zoning standard for each district for lot coverage standards.
2. Clustering: The net density allowed by the underlying zoning district for areas having slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) which remain
undeveloped may be transferred to other areas of the development site if clustering concepts are used and the project retains acceptable (see
subsection B5 of this section) open space.
3. Minimum Lot Sizes: Minimum lot sizes may be waived by up to fifty percent (50%) and building sites may be clustered if thirty percent (30%) or more
of the site is maintained as acceptable open space (see subsection B5 of this section). If the development contains individual lots, all required
setbacks must be maintained.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 374/391
4. Density Bonuses: A density bonus of five percent (5%) shall be awarded for every ten percent (10%) of the property which is dedicated (i.e., if
maximum density per table 17.05.140 of this section is 100 dwelling units, applicant may build 105 units if 10 percent of the property is dedicated;
applicant may build 110 dwelling units if 20 percent of the property is dedicated, etc.), if a project retains open space in the manner and for the
purposes described in subsection B5 of this section.
5. Open Space Standards: In order to utilize clustering, have minimum lot sizes waived, and/or obtain density bonuses, open space for the following
purposes shall be maintained:
a. Natural drainageways;
b. Recreational trails;
c. Public access to publicly owned lands;
d. Preservation of ridge tops and scenic features when identified on the natural features overlay map of the comprehensive plan;
e. Preservation of existing vegetation;
f. Preservation of sensitive wildlife habitat.
The open space must be dedicated to and accepted by a public agency, or in certain circumstances, if the land can be maintained and managed in
perpetuity, a homeowners' association.
C. Grading Standards:
1. All excavation and grading shall be by separate permit and shall conform to the requirements of all building codes as adopted by the city and as
further regulated by this chapter. If a conflict occurs between this chapter and any building codes as adopted, the more restrictive standard shall
apply.
2. Grading shall be minimized; but where alterations to topography are necessary, slopes shall be contoured to provide a smooth, gradual transition
and imitate the natural character and appearance of the existing terrain.
3. All development shall meet city requirements for drainage and erosion control.
4. Unless approved as part of an overall development plan subject to the provisions of this chapter, no disturbance of existing slopes of thirty five
percent (35%) or greater shall be allowed except as provided for below:
a. Conformance with requirements of all building codes as adopted by the city;
b. The area of thirty five percent (35%) or greater slope to be disturbed is less than ten percent (10%) of the total parcel or a maximum of two (2)
acres, whichever is greater, unless the disturbance is for construction of recreational trails or necessary utility or road connections;

17.05.280: WATER CONSERVATION STANDARDS:
In order to encourage efficient water use, the following standards shall be applied to all landscaping and development governed by this chapter including
office, commercial, industrial, institutional, parks and greenways, developer installed landscaping in multiple-family residential projects, and commonly
owned and/or maintained areas of single-family residential projects. These guidelines do not apply to landscaping in private areas of single-family or twofamily
projects. Parks, playgrounds, sports fields, golf courses, schools, and cemeteries are exempt from turf area limits of these standards where a
functional need for turf is established. All other requirements are applicable.
A. Plant Selection And Use Limitation:
1. Grass which is not generally resistant to drought conditions (such as Kentucky bluegrass), high water use plantings (e.g., annuals, container plants)
and water features (e.g., fountains, pools) shall be considered high water uses and shall be limited to not more than forty percent (40%) of the
project's landscaped area if nondrought resistant grass is used, and no more than fifty percent (50%) of the landscaped area if drought resistant
grass is used.
2. Plants selected in all areas not identified for nondrought resistant grass or high water use plantings shall be well suited to the climate, soils, and
topographic conditions of the site, and shall be low water use plants, once established.
3. No nondrought resistant grass or high water use plants shall be allowed on slopes exceeding twenty five percent (25%). Such slopes shall be
planted or reseeded with native and/or drought tolerant introduced species as recommended by the natural resource conservation service. The city
maintains the "recommended species and seed mixes for critical area stabilization" developed by the NRCS. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.290: LANDSCAPE PLAN SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:
Any development, except individual lots for single-family or two-family structures, requiring landscape installation shall require the submission of a
landscape development plan. The landscape development plan shall be reviewed as part of land use development and building application permit
process. Landscaping shall be installed prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy, unless otherwise permitted herein. All plans shall contain the following
information:
A. North arrow, scale, date, title, name and address of owner/business, and site location with address;
B. Accurate scale (at 1 inch = 20 feet or larger), or as appropriate for the scale of development) and property boundaries showing the location of property
lines and their dimensions;
C. Existing and proposed water courses, drainage features, streets, sidewalks, utility lines and easements, and other public or private improvements within
or adjacent to the site;
D. All existing plant material to be removed or retained and delineation of protection methods for plant materials to be retained, including trees of an eight
inch (8") caliper or larger;

17.05.300: INFILL AND REDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
17.05.310: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the infill and redevelopment standards is to encourage compatible development in established areas on vacant, under utilized, or partially
used land. Except as specifically provided in this section, the standards and requirements of the underlying zoning regulations, other sections of this title,
and other provisions of this code shall apply. The following standards are intended to allow greater flexibility for development to achieve the following
community objectives:
A. Efficient use of existing infrastructure and services (i.e., streets, water, sewer, solid waste disposal);
B. Provision of affordable housing;
C. Accomplishment of comprehensive plan goals related to compact development;
D. More efficient use of developable land;
E. Reduction of vehicle miles traveled by creation of a more compact form of development;
F. Avoidance of urban sprawl. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.320: APPLICABILITY:
Infill and redevelopment standards shall apply only if all of the provisions of this section are met. All infill development parcels must comply with the
requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel is located, except as modified by the provisions of this section, which shall supersede the
requirements of the underlying zoning district. Infill development standards may be applied to several parcels of land assembled for redevelopment only if
each individual parcel within the said assemblage meets the definition of an infill development parcel.
The provisions of this section shall only apply to new land subdivisions and developments that meet the criteria of section 17.05.330 of this chapter and
are located within one of the following zones:
A. Residential estate (RE);
B. Residential low density single-family (RL);
C. Residential medium density single-family (RMS);
D. Residential medium density multi-family (RMM);
E. Residential high density multi-family (RH);
F. Residential/commercial/professional (RCP);
G. Neighborhood commercial (NC). (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.330: INFILL DEVELOPMENT PARCEL CRITERIA:
An infill development parcel is any parcel that is bounded on two (2) or more sides by existing development or natural constraints (e.g., waterways, steep
slopes, resource protection areas) and where documentation can be provided by the applicant showing the parcel meets any two (2) of the following
criteria:
A. The parcel has less than two hundred fifty feet (250') of frontage along a public street;
B. Utilities are available in abutting streets so that extension of trunk utility lines is not required;
C. The parcel was established in its current configuration prior to 1981;
D. The parcel is no larger than two (2) acres;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 379/391
E. Because of its shape, the parcel cannot be subdivided to meet the full density potential of the underlying zoning district without a variance. (Ord. 2846
§ 1, 2008)
17.05.340: GENERAL STANDARDS:
Minimum lot size requirements of the underlying zoning district may be reduced in accordance with one of the two (2) methods described below.
A. Dedications In Conjunction With Land Divisions: Where land dedications for permanent parks and open space are accepted by the city through the
subdivision or partition approval process, reductions to lot sizes shall be permitted on a one for one basis, up to the total square footage of dedications,
subject to the following requirements:
1. No lot shall be reduced to less than sixty percent (60%) of the minimum lot size established by the standards of the underlying zoning district through
the application of this provision.
2. Text or a table describing the allocation of right of way, parks, and permanent open space area credits among platted lots shall be recorded as part
of the plat drawings.
3. At the discretion of the city, permanent open space may be conveyed to a land trust, conservancy, or other organization formed to preserve land in
an open space condition, in lieu of dedication to the public or conveyance of title to the city.
4. Reduced size lots must provide a land area with dimensions sufficient to accommodate buildings, parking lots, etc., in accordance with the land use,
setback, and other requirements of the underlying zoning district, unless a variance is granted pursuant to the terms of section 17.02.170 of this title.
B. Lot Size Averaging: To make better use of land at locations where strict application of minimum lot size requirements precludes efficient infill and
redevelopment, the size of some lots within a subdivision may be reduced in accordance with the following requirements:
1. Absent a variance, no lot shall be reduced to less than sixty percent (60%) of the minimum parcel size established by the standards of the underlying
zoning through the application of this provision;
2. The average of the sizes of all the lots in the proposed subdivision shall not be less than the minimum lot size applicable within the zoning district in
which the property is located; and
3. Reduced size lots must provide a land area with dimensions sufficient to accommodate buildings, parking lots, etc., in accordance with the land use,
setback, and other requirements of the underlying zoning district, unless a variance is granted pursuant to the terms of section 17.02.170 of this title.
(Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.350: RESIDENTIAL INFILL AND REDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The following standards are intended to ensure that infill development is compatible with existing buildings and neighborhoods, and therefore apply to all
new residential development:
A. Review Process For Single-Family And Two-Family Dwellings: Single-family and two-family dwellings shall meet the standards of this section and shall
be subject to review by the director. Appeals of this decision shall be to the hearing examiner.
B. Maximum Height: The maximum height permitted outright for a new dwelling on an infill lot in RE, RL or RMS zoning districts shall be thirty five feet
(35') or the average height of the dwellings on all abutting parcels in the same underlying zoning district, whichever is lower.
C. Materials: The new dwelling unit shall be built with materials compatible with dwellings on abutting parcels or facing the subject block, unless a case
can be made for an alternate design.
D. Driveway Coverage: Driveways shall not cover more than one-third (1/3) of the front yard.
E. Accessory Structures: Accessory structures such as sheds and detached garages shall have a footprint no larger than one-half (1/2) the size of the
footprint of the main building.
F. Trees: One tree a minimum size of one and one-half inch (11/2") caliper shall be planted in the planter strip or front yard for every thirty five feet (35') of
lot frontage. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.360: MULTI-FAMILY INFILL AND REDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The following standards are intended to promote compatibility of multi-family infill development with existing buildings and neighborhoods as is reasonably
possible:
A. Multi-family and attached dwelling developments shall meet the standards of this section, and shall be subject to review in accordance with section
17.02.500, "Site Plan Review Committee", of this title.
B. Attached dwellings are permitted based on overall density provisions of the zone.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 380/391
C. Parking areas shall be located behind buildings wherever possible.
D. Multi-family developments shall include visual screening for all mechanical, electrical, communications, and service equipment. The equipment shall be
visually screened from the public right of way by parapets, walls, fences, landscaping, or other suitable means. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.370: APPLICATION PROCESS:
Applications for development projects wishing to utilize infill development standards shall follow the applicable land use process, such as a subdivision or
planned unit development. The applicant shall meet with planning staff personnel to discuss submission of the development plan and application. The
purpose of this meeting is for preliminary and informal review of the criteria and standards, to familiarize the applicant with the pertinent land use and
development standards, and to explain the process which will be followed. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.400: LIGHTING STANDARDS:
17.05.410: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the lighting standards is to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public, improve travel conditions by reducing glare, and
develop lighting practices to reduce light pollution and conserve energy without decreasing safety, utility, or security. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.420: STANDARDS:
The following standards shall apply to all private land uses in all zoning districts:
A. All lights shall be shielded in such a way as to direct all light toward the earth's surface and away from reflective surfaces.
B. All lights shall be shielded in such a way as to direct light away from all adjacent properties, especially those developed with residential uses.
C. Any canopy structure used at a business location shall have recessed lights with diffusers that do not extend below the surface of the canopy.
D. Lighting in residential, residential/commercial/professional, and mixed use zoning districts shall not exceed fifteen feet (15') in height, thirty feet (30') in
height in commercial zoning districts, and forty five feet (45') in height in industrial zoning districts. In commercial zoning districts, lights on poles shall
be no taller than the building whose area they illuminate or as detailed above, measured from grade to top of the structure, whichever is shorter.
E. Any luminaire on a pole, stand, or mounted on a building must have a shield, adjustable reflector, and nonprotruding diffuser.
F. All fixtures must meet building codes as adopted by the city.
G. Any facilities that require floodlighting shall arrange the lights in such a way that they do not shine toward roadways, adjacent properties, or directly into
the night sky.
H. Except as stated elsewhere in these regulations, light levels shall be limited to those published as recommendations by the Illuminating Engineering
Society Of North America.
I. Following review and approval by traffic and engineering department staff, installation of streetlights may be required and cost of such shall be the
developer's responsibility.
J. Plans to limit lighting hours and conserve energy are encouraged. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.430: PLAN SUBMISSION:
Plans for original installation or changes in lighting shall be submitted for all proposed developments, except single-family and two-family dwellings. The
plans shall contain the following information for review and approval by the appropriate city officials:
A. Location on the premises, height, and dimensions of proposed fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, and other related devices.
B. Street lighting plans, whether for public or private roadways, shall be submitted with subdivision plats. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.500: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING STANDARDS:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 381/391
17.05.510: PURPOSE:
The off street parking and loading standards are established to provide minimum standards by which off street parking and loading areas are designed,
constructed, and maintained to provide adequate parking so as not to negatively impact adjoining properties, to provide convenient access to all land uses,
and to assist in reducing traffic congestion and safety hazards. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.520: APPLICABILITY:
Initial construction of any building or land requires conformance with the standards outlined in this chapter for off street parking and loading areas.
Increases in building or land area require compliance with these standards in proportion to the increased area. Changes in use require compliance with
these standards as listed in section 17.01.170 of this title.
Because of the special physical constraints in the central commercial zoning district, off street parking requirements in this district need not be met for any
permitted use which occupies or will occupy an existing building. All off street parking requirements shall be met for uses involving new construction or
expansion of existing structures. (Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.530: RETENTION OF EXISTING PARKING AND LOADING AREAS:
Land areas actually being used for off street parking in connection with any building or use may not be reduced in capacity to fewer parking spaces than
required by this chapter without an exception approved by the city council. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.540: REVIEW REQUIRED:
No person, firm or corporation may construct, reconstruct, alter, or surface any parking area without first obtaining written approval from the city. (Ord.
2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.550: PLANS REQUIRED:
Two (2) copies of plans for parking area improvements are required to be submitted to the planning and development services department. Such plans
shall include:
A. A plot plan on which space arrangement, vehicle and pedestrian circulation, ingress and egress, curbing, and landscaped areas are shown.
B. Details of fence and wall construction and lighting installation in accordance with applicable building and electrical codes.
C. Plans shall be drawn to scale and show materials of construction, details of drainage structures, methods of disposal of surface water drainage,
provisions for protection of natural drainage to and from adjoining properties, including any necessary easements, landscaping, lighting, and any other
information deemed necessary by the city. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.560: DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
All off street parking and loading areas in residential/commercial/professional, commercial, and industrial zoning districts and all off street parking and
loading areas serving more than two (2) dwelling units in residential zoning districts shall conform to the following design standards:
A. Surfacing: All parking, loading, and vehicular access areas shall be paved, not graveled, to provide a permanent surface capable of being marked and
able to withstand the type of vehicular traffic to which such an area is likely to be subjected. Alternative surfacing proposals shall require review and
approval by the public works and fire departments, and may require approval by the city council.
B. Drainage: All paved areas shall be sloped to drain. All drainage structure designs and methods of disposal of surface water drainage shall conform to
city standards and be approved by the city development services engineer.
C. Illumination: Any illumination of off street parking and loading areas, including vehicle service areas and drive-up facilities, shall conform to section
17.05.400 of this chapter.
D. Landscaping: Off street parking and loading areas shall be landscaped with trees and shrubs to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and
parking lot lights. In addition, parking lots shall be shaded to reduce the amount of absorbed and reflected heat. Landscaping shall be designed and
installed in conformance with section 17.05.200, "Landscaping Standards", of this chapter. All landscape and pedestrian areas shall be protected from
vehicular encroachment by curbs. Placement of curbs shall not encroach into required setback or required landscape areas. Required curbs shall be
constructed of concrete approved by the city and may be either formed in place or extruded.
E. Placement: No on site parking, loading, service, or vehicular circulation areas may encroach into or reduce any required setback or buffer areas. All
parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that vehicles do not overhang or park in or over the public right of way, including sidewalks, or use
public right of way for maneuver area.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=601 382/391
F. Screening: Parking lots for more than five (5) cars shall be screened from adjacent residential zoning districts or uses by a code compliant, sight
obscuring fence at least four feet (4') in height.
G. Circulation: On site circulation shall be designed to protect pedestrians and safely move vehicles. Minimum design standards for turning radii shall
comply with current American Association Of State Highway And Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards for vehicles. Maneuver space and
loading/off loading areas for delivery vehicles shall not obstruct or otherwise interfere with required parking stalls. Connections between abutting
parking areas shall be provided whenever possible.
H. Pavement Markings And Signage: All parking space boundaries and directional traffic arrows shall be marked and properly maintained on the parking
lot surface. Signs that identify parking lot usage terms and conditions, and directional signs shall conform to the standards of title 15, chapter 15.20,
"Sign Code", of this code.
I. Layout And Dimensions: The various dimensions for required off street parking facilities may not be less than set forth in section 17.05.570, table
17.05.570-2 (parking lot design diagram) of this chapter. Where a private parking lot is designed so that cars may overhang landscaped areas or
sidewalks on the same property as the private parking lot, the stall depth for standard size cars may be reduced by two feet (2'). In areas where cars
overhang a private sidewalk or walkway, the minimum unobstructed width of the walk may not be less than five feet (5'). In areas where cars overhang
landscape areas, the minimum width of the landscaped area may not be less than eight feet (8').
J. Compact Car Parking: A maximum of one or up to thirty percent (30%) of parking spaces, whichever is greater, may be sized for compact cars.
Compact spaces may not be less than eight feet (8') wide and sixteen feet (16') deep.
K. Handicap Parking: A minimum of one parking stall for the handicapped shall be provided, or as based on Americans with disabilities act requirements,
whichever is greater.
L. Bicycle Parking: For all parking lots requiring twenty (20) or more spaces, a minimum of five percent (5%) of the required number of automobile spaces
or five (5) bicycle spaces, whichever is greater, shall be provided.
M. Exceptions: On street parking and/or maneuver area within the public right of way shall be allowed in the following areas:
1. Warehouse historic district, specifically 1st and 2nd Avenues extending from East Center to East Sutter and including all side streets within said
boundary, subject to review and approval by the traffic department of any on street parking prior to work commencing. Cost of completion of the
spaces shall be at the cost of the applicant.
2. Downtown historic district as established by the Pocatello city council in December 1985, or as subsequently amended.
3. Adjacent alleys in residential/commercial/professional and commercial general zoning districts may be used for maneuver area for parking lots
accommodating five (5) or fewer vehicles. All standards set forth in this section shall be adhered to. (Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.570: PARKING STANDARDS BY LAND USE:
The purpose of required parking spaces is to provide enough on site parking to accommodate the majority of traffic generated by the range of uses which
might locate at the site over time. The required parking numbers correspond to use categories, as well as specific uses, in response to this long term
emphasis. Expansion, reconstruction, or change in legal, nonconforming situations shall be governed by the terms of section 17.01.170 of this title. The
number of parking stalls required by specific land uses is listed in table 17.05.570-1 of this section.
Up to fifty percent (50%) of required parking spaces may be provided off site in a city approved parking lot which is located within a five hundred foot (500')
radius of the subject site, which parking lot may be owned by a third party, provided a signed agreement from the third party parking lot owner is obtained
and the shared parking arrangement does not reduce the third party owner's parking spaces below code requirements for the owner's use.

Chapter 17.06
SPECIAL USE STANDARDS
17.06.100: ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to encourage provision of a wider variety of dwelling units, a mix of housing types that responds to changing
family needs, a means for residents to remain in their neighborhoods, as well as allowing new housing while preserving the existing neighborhood
character.
B. Applicability: Accessory dwellings are conditionally permitted in all residential, commercial, and mixed use zoning districts, provided they are in
compliance with the provisions set forth in this section. If conflicts occur between these and other standards of this title, the more restrictive shall apply.
C. Accessory Dwelling Standards:

17.06.400: HOME OCCUPATIONS:
A. Intent: The intent of this section is not to allow circumvention of zoning restrictions on commercial activity within a residential zoning district. Rather, the
intent is to provide, under limited circumstances, for the additional use of residential properties for certain nonresidential activities. In general, a
residential structure or accessory to the residential structure within a residential zoning district may be used for limited business purposes only if the
premises are primarily a residence whose occupants are also conducting limited commercial activities at that location. The commercial activity must be
such that it can be conducted without negatively impacting the health, safety or general welfare of the neighborhood, unduly increasing traffic or noise,
or substantially changing the residential character of a neighborhood. If the home occupation does not meet these general criteria and the standards
set out below, the use is not permitted.
B. Standards: All home occupations shall be subject to the following standards:
1. A home occupation certificate must be filed with the planning and development services department.
2. The presence or pursuit of the home occupation shall not result in any nuisance condition or excessive noise, as defined by this code, nor shall the
approval of a home occupation certificate allow circumvention of any other city codes.
3. All persons involved in carrying out the home occupation, whether family members, proprietors, partners, or co-equal shareholders, must have as
their primary residence the same dwelling unit as that housing the home occupation, with no on site assistance from other persons or employees.
Employees who meet the business owner off site to perform work related activities shall be permitted, provided they do not come to the home.
4. The dwelling unit must be suitable for use for the home occupation without modifications except as specified hereafter. Remodeling or modification of
any portion of the dwelling unit or accessory structure to be used in the course of the home occupation shall be prohibited if it would change the
character, use, or occupancy classification of the dwelling as set forth in the currently adopted building code. Remodeling and modifications
necessary to accommodate handicapped persons shall be allowed, provided applicable building permits have been issued.
5. No oversized vehicle as defined in section 10.08.090 of this code, or any vehicle which by virtue of dimensions, gross vehicle weight or declared use
is required by Idaho Code to display, or does display, commercial or apportioned registration plates, may be used or stored on site or on street in
carrying out the home occupation.
6. No assets, inventory or raw materials used in a home occupation shall be displayed or stored outdoors. No hazardous materials, as determined by
the Pocatello fire department, may be stored at the site of the home occupation.
7. Hours of operation shall be limited to no earlier than six thirty o'clock (6:30) A.M. and no later than nine o'clock (9:00) P.M. Outdoor activities of the
home occupation, if any, shall not be permitted earlier than eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. or later than seven o'clock (7:00) P.M.
8. Sales and services to patrons shall be arranged by appointment and scheduled so that no more than one patron vehicle is on the premises at any
one time.
9. Delivery vehicles must meet all truck route regulations of this code.
C. Prohibited Uses: The following uses shall not be permitted as a home occupation: retail sales; auto repair; manufacturing; adult entertainment; and
those of similar classification.
D. Enforcement: In addition to the other remedies contained within this title, any violation of the terms of an approved home occupation certificate shall
result in revocation of the certificate. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
