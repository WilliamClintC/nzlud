GENERAL REFERENCES
Wetlands  See Ch. 192.
Zoning  See Ch. 198.
Subdivision of land  See Ch. 322.
§ 194-1. Authority.
This chapter is adopted under authority granted by the Home Rule
Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution, the Home Rule statutes, and
pursuant to the regulations of the Federal Clean Water Act found at 40 CFR
122.34.
§ 194-2. Purpose.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the residents of the Town of Fairhaven, the
protection of Fairhaven's water bodies and groundwater, and the
protection of Fairhaven's natural resources through the regulation of
nonstormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the
maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This
chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in
order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process.
B. Increased and contaminated stormwater runoff associated with
developed land uses and the accompanying increase in impervious
surface are major causes of impairment of water quality and flow in
lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, wetlands, and groundwater. The harmful
impacts of illicit discharge, soil erosion, and sedimentation are:
(1) Impairment of water quality and flow in lakes, ponds, streams,
rivers, wetlands, groundwater, and drinking water supplies;
(2) Contamination of drinking water supplies;
(3) Erosion of stream channels and downstream coastal areas;
(4) Alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat;
(5) Flooding;
(6) Overloading or clogging of municipal stormwater management
systems.
C. The objectives of this chapter are to:
194:1
(1) Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user;
(2) Prohibit illicit connections and unauthorized discharges to the
municipal separate storm sewer system and require their removal;
(3) Protect water resources;
(4) Require practices that eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation;
(5) Control the volume and rate of stormwater runoff resulting from
land-disturbance activities in order to minimize potential impacts
of flooding;
(6) Require practices to manage and treat stormwater runoff
generated from new development and redevelopment;
(7) Establish minimum construction and post-construction stormwater
management standards and design criteria for the regulation and
control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(8) Protect groundwater and surface water from degradation;
(9) Promote infiltration and the recharge of groundwater;
(10) Maximize recharge of groundwater in the Fairhaven Aquifer
Protection District.
(11) Prevent pollutants from entering the Town's municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) and reduce or eliminate pollutants
entering the Town's MS4 from existing users;
(12) Ensure that soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and
stormwater runoff management practices are incorporated into the
site planning and design process and are implemented and
maintained;
(13) Ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of
structural stormwater best management practices;
(14) Require practices to control waste such as discarded building
materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary
waste at construction sites that may cause adverse impacts to
water quality;
(15) Comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to
stormwater discharges, including total maximum daily load
requirements;
(16) Establish the Town of Fairhaven's legal authority to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter through inspection,
monitoring and enforcement; and

wetland, marsh, bog, wet meadow and swamp are defined in MGL c. 131,
§ 40, and are collectively known as vegetated wetlands. Credible evidence
as to wetland affinities of other vegetation in an area shall be considered in
making wetland determinations.
§ 194-4. Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to land-disturbing activities on any developed and
undeveloped land within the jurisdiction of the Town of Fairhaven and water
and other materials entering the Town of Fairhaven municipal storm drain
system. Land disturbance of 40,000 square feet or more in area is hereby
prohibited except in compliance with this chapter. The discharge of any
substance other than stormwater into the municipal stormwater system is
hereby prohibited except in compliance with this chapter.
A. Regulated land-disturbance activities.
(1) Regulated activities shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) Land disturbance of greater than 40,000 square feet,
associated with construction or reconstruction of structures;

stormwater runoff flowing from the property into a public way
or the municipal storm drain system; or
(f) Construction or reconstruction of a structure or structures
with more than 40,000 square feet of roof drainage, or
combined roof and surface drainage.
3. Editor's Note: See Ch. 192, Wetlands.
§ 194-3 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 194-4
194:10
(2) Erosion and sedimentation control requirement. A project which
includes land disturbance of less than 40,000 square feet shall be
considered to be in conformance with this chapter if soils or other
eroded matter have been or will be prevented from being deposited
onto adjacent properties, rights-of-way, public storm drainage
systems, or wetlands or watercourses. The design, installation, and
maintenance of erosion and sediment control operations and
facilities shall adhere to the standards specified in the regulations
to this chapter.
(3) Exempted projects. Notwithstanding the provisions of above, the
procedural requirements of this chapter shall not apply to activities
which have been approved by the Planning Board or the
Conservation Commission, provided that the applicant has
submitted to the Board of Public Works a written determination
from the Planning Board or the Conservation Commission that the
project complies with the performance standards otherwise
required by this chapter.
B. Discharge prohibitions.
(1) Prohibition of illegal discharges: No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants
or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a
violation of applicable water quality standards, other than
stormwater. The construction, use, maintenance or continued
existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation,
illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the
connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or
prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in
violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying
sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. The
commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to
the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(a) Water line flushing;
(b) Flow from other potable water sources;
(c) Landscape irrigation or lawn watering;
(d) Diverted stream flows;
(e) Rising groundwater;
(f) Uncontaminated groundwater infiltration as defined in 40 CFR
35.2005(b)(20);

dechlorinatedtypically less than one ppm chlorine), provided
the water is allowed to stand for one week prior to draining
and the pool is drained in such a way as not to cause a
nuisance;
(l) Discharge from street sweeping;
(m) Firefighting activities;
(n) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the Board of Public Works prior to the time of
the test;
(o) Discharges specified in writing by the Board of Public Works as
being necessary to protect public health, safety, welfare, or the
environment; and
(p) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater
discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered
under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency, provided that the discharge is in full compliance with
all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain
system.
(2) Suspension of MS4 access.
(a) Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The Board of Public Works will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
(b) Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.
The violator may petition the Board of Public Works for a
reconsideration and hearing. Any person commits an offense if
the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated

§ 194-5. Administration.
The Board of Public Works shall administer, implement and enforce this
chapter. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the Board of Public
Works through this chapter may be delegated in writing by the Board of
Public Works to its employees or agents.
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
Board of Public Works.
(c) The Board of Public Works may, without prior notice, suspend
MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to
the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
Board of Public Works may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters
of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
(3) Industrial or construction activity discharges: Any person subject
to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Board of Public Works prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
C. Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from the
requirements of this chapter:
(1) Normal maintenance and improvement of land in agricultural use
as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act (MGL c. 131, § 40) and
its associated regulations (310 CMR 10.00).
(2) Repair of septic systems when required by the Board of Health for
the protection of public health and compliance with Subsection B.
(3) Normal maintenance of existing landscaping, gardens or lawn
areas associated with a single-family dwelling, provided such

The Board of Public Works may adopt, and periodically amend, rules,
regulations, and/or written guidance to effectuate the purposes of this
chapter. Failure by the Board of Public Works to promulgate such rules and
regulations, or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court, shall not act
to suspend or invalidate the effect of this chapter. Such regulations, rules or
guidance may include, without limitation, provisions for the establishment
of one or more categories of administrative review approvals for specific
types or sizes of projects. Administrative review applications that meet all
the standard requirements may be issued by one or more agents designated
in writing by the Board of Public Works, without the requirement for a
public hearing as detailed in this chapter. Administrative review approval
shall comply with all other provisions of this chapter.
§ 194-7. Land-disturbance permits.
Permit issuance is required prior to any activity disturbing 40,000 or more
square feet of land. The site owner or his agent shall apply for the permit
with the Board of Public Works. While application may be made by a
representative, the permitted must be the owner of the site.
A. Applications. An application shall be made to the Board of Public Works
in a form and containing information as specified in this chapter and in
the regulations adopted by the Board of Public Works and shall be
accompanied by payment of the appropriate application and review
fees.
B. Fees. Fees shall be established by Board of Public Works to cover
expenses connected with public notice, application review, and
monitoring permit compliance. The fee shall be sufficient to also cover
professional review. The Board of Public Works is authorized to retain a
registered professional engineer or other professional consultant to
advise the Board of Public Works on any or all aspects of these plans.
Applicants must pay review fees before the review process may begin.
C. Information requests. The Board of Public Works may request such
additional information as is necessary to enable the Board of Public
Works to determine whether the proposed land-disturbance activity will
protect water resources and comply with the requirements of this
chapter.
D. Determination of completeness. The Board of Public Works shall make a
determination as to the completeness of the application and adequacy
of the materials submitted. No review shall take place until the
application has been found to be complete.
E. Coordination with other boards. On receipt of a complete application
for a land-disturbance permit, the Board of Public Works shall
distribute one copy each to the Planning Board, Department of Public
Works, Board of Health, and the Building Inspector for review and
§ 194-6 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 194-7
194:14
comment. Said agencies shall, in their discretion, investigate the case
and report their recommendations to the Board of Public Works. The
Board of Public Works shall not hold a hearing on the land-disturbance
permit until it has received reports from said agencies or until said
agencies have allowed 45 days to elapse after receipt of the application
materials without submission of a report thereon.
F. Entry. Filing an application for a land-disturbance permit grants the
Board of Public Works or its agent permission to enter the site to verify
the information in the application and to inspect for compliance with
permit conditions, to the extent permitted by law.
G. Hearing. Once in receipt of a complete application for a landdisturbance
permit, the Board of Public Works shall hold a public
hearing and shall take final action within 90 days from the close of the
hearing unless such time is extended by agreement between the
applicant and the Board of Public Works. Notice of the public hearing
shall, at least seven business days prior to said hearing, be given by
publication in a local paper of general circulation, and by posting. The
Board of Public Works shall be responsible for publishing the notice in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city or Town once in each of two
successive weeks, the first publication to be not less than 14 days
before the day of said hearing, and posting the notice at the Town Hall.
The Board of Public Works shall make the application available for
inspection by the public during business hours at their Town of
Fairhaven Office.
H. Action. The Board of Public Works may:
(1) Approve the application and issue a permit if it finds that the
proposed plan will protect water resources and complies with the
requirements of this chapter;
(2) Approve the application and issue a permit with conditions,
modifications or restrictions that the Board of Public Works
determines are required to ensure that the project will protect
water resources and complies with the requirements of this
chapter; or
(3) Disapprove the application and deny a permit if it finds that the
proposed plan will not protect water resources or fails to meet the
objectives of and to comply with the requirements of this chapter. If
the Board of Public Works finds that the applicant has submitted
insufficient information to describe the site, the work, or the effect
of the work on water quality and runoff volume, the Board of Public
Works may disapprove the application, denying a permit.
I. Project changes. The permittee, or his or her agent, must notify the
agent of the Board of Public Works in writing of any change or
alteration of a land-disturbing activity before the change or alteration
occurs. If the agent of the Board of Public Works determines that the
change or alteration is significant, the agent of the Board of Public
§ 194-7 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 194-7
194:15
§ 194-8. Erosion and sedimentation control plan.
Works may require that an amended application or a full application be
filed in accordance with this section. If any change or alteration from
the land-disturbance permit occurs during land-disturbing activities,
the agent of the Board of Public Works may require the installation of
interim erosion and sedimentation control measures before approving
the change or alteration.
J. Waivers.
(1) Following a public hearing on a waiver request, the Board of Public
Works may waive strict compliance with any requirement of this
chapter or the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder,
where:
(a) Such action is allowed by federal, state, and local statutes and/
or regulations; and
(b) Is in the public interest; and
(c) Is not inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
(2) Any applicant must submit a written request to be granted such a
waiver. Such a request shall be accompanied by an explanation or
documentation supporting the waiver request and demonstrating
that strict application of the chapter does not further the purposes
or objectives of this chapter.
(3) All waiver requests shall be discussed and voted on at the public
hearing for the project.
(4) If, in the Board of Public Works' opinion, additional time or
information is required for review of a waiver request, the Board of
Public Works may continue a hearing to a certain date announced
at the meeting. In the event the applicant objects to a continuance,
or fails to provide requested information, the waiver request shall
be denied.
A. The erosion and sediment control plan should include a written
description of the plan as well as an emergency response outline
(including response phone numbers) and a maintenance schedule. The
plan shall meet the following objectives and criteria:
(1) Keep disturbed areas small: no more than 60 feet in width and 100
feet in length of a single lot, or five acres of the overall tract at one
time. Said plan shall identify design issues and methods employed
to address such items as topography, soils, vegetation, steep
slopes, wetlands and water bodies.
(2) Stabilize and protect disturbed areas quickly: Exposed areas and
stockpiles shall be revegetated within 40 days of being exposed.
The Board of Public Works, depending on weather conditions, may

§ 194-9. Stormwater management plan.
The stormwater management plan shall contain sufficient information to
describe the nature and purpose of the proposed development, pertinent
conditions of the site and the adjacent areas, and proposed best
management practices for the permanent management and treatment of
stormwater. The stormwater management plan shall contain sufficient
information for the Board of Public Works to evaluate the environmental
impact, effectiveness, and acceptability of the measures proposed by the
applicant for reducing adverse impacts from stormwater. The plan shall be
designed to meet the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standards
set forth in the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Policy and DEP
Stormwater Management Handbook Volumes I and II. The stormwater
management plan shall fully describe the project in drawings, and
narrative. The applicant shall submit such material as is required for the
administration of this chapter.
§ 194-10. Operation and maintenance plans.
require slope and stockpile stabilization sooner. Methods for
stabilizing disturbed areas include mechanical, structural, and
vegetative. In some cases, some or all of these methods should
be combined in order to retard erosion. These methods shall be
identified in the erosion and sedimentation control plan.
(3) Keep stormwater runoff velocities low: Velocities of runoff should
be in the range of two to 10 feet per second. The removal of the
existing vegetative cover during the development and the resulting
increase in impermeable surface area after development will
increase both the volume and velocity of runoff. These increases
must be taken into account when providing for erosion control.
(4) Protect disturbed areas from stormwater runoff: Conservation
measures can be utilized to prevent water from entering and
running over the disturbed area. Diversions and other control
practices to intercept runoff from higher elevations, store or divert
it away from vulnerable areas, and direct it towards stabilized
outlets should be utilized. Selected measures should be identified
on the plan and in text.
(5) Retain sediment within site area: The best way to control sediment
is to prevent erosion; however, sediment can be retained by two
methods:
(a) Filtering runoff as it flows and detaining sediment; or
(b) Detain runoff for a period of time so that the soil particles
settle out.
A. An operation and maintenance plan (O&M plan) for the permanent
stormwater management system is required at the time of application
§ 194-8 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 194-10
194:17
§ 194-11. Inspection and site supervision.
for all projects. The maintenance plan shall be designed to ensure
compliance with this chapter and that the Massachusetts Surface Water
Quality Standards contained in 314 CMR 4.00 are met in all seasons
and throughout the life of the system. The operation and maintenance
plan shall include any requirements deemed necessary by the Board
of Public Works to insure compliance with said plan, including without
limitation a covenant. The Board of Public Works shall make the final
decision of what maintenance option is appropriate in a given situation.
The Board of Public Works will consider natural features, proximity
of site to water bodies and wetlands, extent of impervious surfaces,
size of the site, the types of stormwater management structures, and
potential need for ongoing maintenance activities when making this
decision. Once approved by the Board of Public Works, the operation
and maintenance plan shall be recorded at the Bristol County Registry
of Deeds by the permittee, shall run with the land, shall remain on file
with the Board of Public Works and shall be an ongoing requirement.
The operation and maintenance plan shall conform to the requirements
listed in the regulations adopted by the Board of Public Works for
the administration of this chapter. Stormwater management easements
shall be provided by the property owner(s) in areas and as necessary to
carry out the required maintenance.
B. Changes to operation and maintenance plans.
(1) The owner(s) of the stormwater management system must notify
the Board of Public Works or its agent of changes in ownership or
assignment of financial responsibility.
(2) The maintenance schedule in the maintenance agreement may be
amended to achieve the purposes of this chapter by mutual
agreement of the Board of Public Works and the responsible
parties. Amendments must be in writing and signed by all
responsible parties.
A. Pre-construction meeting. Prior to clearing, excavation, construction,
or any land-disturbing activity requiring a permit, the applicant, the
applicant's technical representative, the general contractor, pertinent
subcontractors, and any person with authority to make changes to the
project, shall meet with the Board of Public Works or its designated
agent to review the permitted plans and proposed implementation.
B. Commission inspection. The Board of Public Works or its designated
agent shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either
approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee
wherein the work fails to comply with the approved plans and any
conditions of approval. One copy of the approved plans and conditions
of approval, signed by the Board of Public Works shall be maintained at
the site during the progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections,
§ 194-10 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 194-11
194:18
§ 194-12. Surety.
The Board of Public Works may require the permittee to post, before the
start of land-disturbance activity, a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit,
cash, or other acceptable security. The form of the bond shall be approved
by Town Counsel, and be in an amount deemed sufficient by the Board of
Public Works to insure that the work will be completed in accordance with
the permit. If the project is phased, the Board of Public Works may release
part of the bond as each phase is completed in compliance with the permit,
but the bond may not be fully released until the Board of Public Works has
received the final report as required by § 194-13 and issued a certificate of
completion.
the permittee shall notify the agent of the Board of Public Works at least
three working days before each of the following events:
(1) Erosion and sediment control measures are in place and stabilized;
(2) Rough grading has been substantially completed;
(3) Final grading has been substantially completed;
(4) Bury inspection: prior to backfilling of any underground drainage
or stormwater conveyance structures;
(5) Close of the construction season; and
(6) Final landscaping (permanent stabilization) and project final
completion.
C. Permittee inspections. The permittee or his/her agent shall conduct and
document inspections of all control measures no less than weekly or as
specified in the permit, and prior to and following anticipated storm
events. The purpose of such inspections will be to determine the overall
effectiveness of the control plan, and the need for maintenance or
additional control measures. The permittee or his/her agent shall
submit monthly reports to the Board of Public Works or designated
agent in a format approved by the Board of Public Works. The Board of
Public Works may require, as a condition of approval, that an
environmental site monitor, approved by the Board of Public Works, be
retained by the applicant to conduct such inspections and prepare and
submit such reports to the Board of Public Works or its designated
agent.
D. Access permission. To the extent permitted by law, or if authorized by
the owner or other party in control of the property, the Board of Public
Works, its agents, officers, and employees may enter upon privately
owned property for the purpose of performing their duties under this
chapter and may make or cause to be made such examinations, surveys
or sampling as the Board of Public Works deems reasonably necessary
to determine compliance with the permit.
§ 194-11 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 194-13
194:19
§ 194-13. Final reports.
Upon completion of the work, the permittee shall submit a report (including
certified as-built construction plans) from a registered professional
engineer (PE), registered professional land surveyor (PLS), or a certified
professional in erosion and sedimentation control (CPESC) certifying that
all erosion and sedimentation control devices, and approved changes and
modifications, have been completed in accordance with the conditions of
the approved land-disturbance permit. Any discrepancies should be noted
in the cover letter.
§ 194-14. Certificate of completion.
The Board of Public Works will issue a certificate of completion upon receipt
and approval of the final reports and/or upon otherwise determining that
all work of the land disturbance permit has been satisfactorily completed
in conformance with this chapter. The certificate of completion shall be
recorded at the Registry of Deeds by the owner(s).
§ 194-15. Monitoring of discharges.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Board of Public Works shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the Board of Public Works.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Board of Public Works ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater,
and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state
and federal law.
(3) The Board of Public Works shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the Board of Public Works to conduct monitoring and/or sampling
of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The Board of Public Works has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
§ 194-13 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 194-15
194:20
§ 194-16. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater
pollutants by use of best management practices.
The Board of Public Works will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm
drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials
or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premises which is, or may be, the
source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Board
of Public Works and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Board of Public Works access
to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge
permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility
with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
Board of Public Works reasonable access to the permitted facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required
by this chapter.
(7) If the Board of Public Works has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the Board of Public Works may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

194:21
§ 194-17. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 194-18. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain
system, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Board of Public Works in person or
by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the Board of Public Works within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 194-19. Enforcement.
A. The Board of Public Works or an authorized agent of the Board of Public
Works shall enforce this chapter, regulations, orders, violation notices,
and enforcement orders, and may pursue all civil and criminal remedies
for such violations.
B. Orders.
(1) The Board of Public Works or an authorized agent of the Board of
Public Works may issue a written order to enforce the provisions of
this chapter or the regulations thereunder, which may include:
(a) A requirement to cease and desist from the violating activity
until there is compliance with the chapter and any existing
permits.
§ 194-17 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 194-19
194:22

and sedimentation control measures.
(c) Monitoring, analyses, and reporting.
(d) Remediation of erosion and sedimentation resulting directly or
indirectly from the land-disturbing activity.
(e) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges.
(f) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property.
(2) If the enforcing person determines that abatement or remediation
of erosion and sedimentation, stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards is required, the order shall set forth a
deadline by which such abatement or remediation must be
completed. Said order shall further advise that, should the violator
or property owner fail to abate or perform remediation within the
specified deadline, the Town of Fairhaven may, at its option,
undertake such work, and the property owner shall reimburse the
Town's expenses.
(3) Within 30 days after completing all measures necessary to abate
the violation or to perform remediation, the violator and the
property owner shall be notified of the costs incurred by the Town
of Fairhaven, including administrative costs. The violator or
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount
or basis of costs with the Board of Public Works within 30 days of
receipt of the notification of the costs incurred. If the amount due is
not received by the expiration of the time in which to file a protest
or within 30 days following a decision of the Board of Public Works
affirming or reducing the costs, or from a final decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction, the costs shall become a special assessment
against the property owner and shall constitute a lien on the
owner's property for the amount of said costs.
C. Criminal penalty. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter,
or regulation, order or permit issued thereunder, shall be punished by a
fine of not more than $300 for each offense. Each day or part thereof
that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
D. Noncriminal disposition. As an alternative to criminal prosecution or
civil action, the Town of Fairhaven may elect to utilize the noncriminal
disposition procedure, in which case the Board of Public Works or
authorized agent shall be the enforcing person. The penalty for each
violation shall be $300. Each day or part thereof that such violation
occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.

E. Appeals. All decisions or orders of the Board of Public Works shall be
final. Further relief shall be to a court of competent jurisdiction.
F. Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal,
state or local law.

§ 194-20. Compliance with provisions of EPA's general permit for
MS4s in Massachusetts.
This chapter shall be implemented by the Board of Public Works in
accordance with the requirements of the EPA's most recent general permit
for MS4s in Massachusetts relating to illicit connections and discharges,
construction site runoff, and post-construction stormwater management.
The Board of Public Works shall include these requirements in any
regulations that it issues. The Board of Public Works may establish
additional requirements by regulation to further the purposes and
objectives of this chapter, so long as they are not less stringent than those
in the MS4 general permit for Massachusetts.
§ 194-21. Severability.
If any provision, paragraph, sentence, or clause of this chapter or the
application thereof to any person, establishment or circumstance shall be
held invalid for any reason, all other provisions shall continue in full force
and effect to the extent permitted by law.

§ 198-6. Planning Board.
The Fairhaven Planning Board is hereby designated as one of the special
permit granting authorities (SPGA) under the provisions of MGL c. 40A, § 9.
(See § 198-15C of this chapter.)
§ 198-7. Zoning Board of Appeals.
There is hereby established a Zoning Board of Appeals of five members
and four associate members appointed by the Selectmen, as provided in
MGL c. 40A, which shall act on all matters within its jurisdiction under
this chapter in the manner prescribed in Chapter 40A of the General
Laws. The Board established hereunder shall act as the permit granting
authority for appeals under MGL c. 40A, §§ 8 and 10, and one of the
special permit granting authorities as provided in MGL c. 40A, § 9. This
subsection should not be construed as to limit any of the authority of
the Zoning Board of Appeals under any other section of Chapter 40A.
A.
An Appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be taken by any person
aggrieved by reason of his/her inability to obtain a permit or
enforcement action from the Fairhaven Building Commissioner for
reasons in violation of the provisions of Chapter 40A or this Chapter
198, Zoning, as provided under MGL c. 40A, § 8. An appeal to the

§ 198-8. Special permit.
§ 198-9. Variances.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize upon appeal, or upon petition
in cases where dimensional modifications are sought with respect to a
particular parcel of land or to an existing building thereon, a variance
from the terms of this chapter, where, owing to conditions specifically
affecting each parcel or such building, but not affecting generally the zoning
district in which it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
hold public hearings in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 40A
on all appeals and petitions brought before it.
A special permit issued by a special permit granting authority (SPGA)
as provided for in this chapter shall be required for certain uses
permitted in specified districts. Such special permits may be issued for
specific uses, which are in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter and shall be subject to additional conditions, safeguards
and limitations on time, space and use as the designated SPGA may
reasonably require. A special permit shall not be issued by an SPGA
for an excluded or prohibited use as defined in this chapter. The SPGA
shall take into account the general purpose and intent of this chapter
and, in order to preserve community values, may impose conditions
and safeguards deemed necessary to protect the surrounding
neighborhood, in addition to the applicable requirements of this
chapter, and shall not issue a special permit which shall appear to be
detrimental to the public interest because:
It appears that the intent of the performance standards of § 198-24
or other requirements of this chapter cannot be or will not be met.
(1)
Traffic generated or patterns of access and egress would cause
congestion, hazard or substantial change in established
neighborhood character.
(2)
The continued operation of or development of adjacent uses as
permitted by this chapter would be adversely affected by the
nature of the proposed use.
(3)
(4) A nuisance or hazard would be created.
The specific proposal derogates from the intent and purpose of the
chapter.
(5)
A.
No special permit shall be issued except following a public hearing
within 65 days after filing of an application with the granting authority.
Failure of the special permit granting authority to act within 90 days
following said public hearing shall be deemed a grant of the application.
A special permit granted under this section shall lapse if substantial use
thereof or construction has not begun within two years, except for good
cause.
B.
§ 198-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 198-9
1:131
this chapter would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to
the appellant and where desirable relief may be granted without nullifying
or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this chapter, but
not otherwise. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 40A on all variance applications
brought before it.
§ 198-10. Amendments.
This chapter may from time to time be changed by amendment, addition or
repeal by the Town Meeting in the manner provided in MGL c. 40A, § 5, and
any amendments therein.
§ 198-11. Validity.
The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter shall not invalidate
any other section or provision thereof.
§ 198-12. Applicability of greater restrictions.
Where the application of this chapter imposes greater restrictions than
those imposed by any other regulations, permits, restrictions, easements,
covenants or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
§ 198-13. When effective.
This chapter shall take effect when, following adoption by the town, it is
approved by the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
and is published or posted as provided by law. Upon its effective date, it
shall supersede the Zoning Bylaw and all amendments to it previously in
effect.

ARTICLE III
General Regulations
§ 198-21. Nonconforming uses.
The lawful use of any structure or land existing at the time of the enactment
of this chapter may be continued although such structure or use does not
conform with provisions of this chapter subject to the following conditions
and exceptions:
§ 198-22. Accessory buildings and uses [Amended 3-23-1968 ATM
by Art. 58; 4-3-1971 ATM by Art.80; 2-9-1978 STM by Art. 2;
5-7-1988 STM by Art. 7; 5-9-1989 ATM by Art. 19; 12-10-1992 STM
by Art.1; 2-11 2004 STM by Art. 16].
Buildings and uses, which are customarily incidental and subordinate to
the uses allowed as permitted uses in any zone are allowed as accessory
buildings and uses, except as expressly restricted or prohibited in this
Abandonment. A nonconforming use which has been abandoned or
discontinued for a period of two years shall not be reestablished and
any further use shall conform with this chapter, except in cases of land
used for agriculture, horticulture or floriculture where such nonuse
shall have existed for a period of five years.
A.
Alterations. A nonconforming structure may not in any one year be
altered except as ordered by the Building Commissioner to make it
safe, or repaired in any ten-year period to the extent that the cost
of such alterations exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
determined by the Building Commissioner at the time of the change.
B.
Extension. No increase in the area or extent of the nonconforming use
of a structure or land may be made.
C.
Restoration. No nonconforming structure damaged by fire, storm or
other causes to the extent of 75% of its replacement value as
determined by the Building Commissioner shall be repaired or rebuilt
except in conformity with this chapter, and further provided that such
restoring shall be complete within two years after such catastrophe.
D.
Changes. Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall
be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. On special permit from
the Zoning Board of Appeals, the use of the premises may be changed
from one nonconforming use to another which is no more objectionable
to the neighborhood.
E.
The construction of a building or operation of land use under a building
permit or special permit shall conform to any subsequent amendment
to the chapter adopted after the issuance of the permit unless such
construction or operation commences within a six-month period
beginning with issuance of the building permit or special permit.

15.Editor's Note: This subsection also includes drawings which help illustrate its provisions.
Said drawings are on file in the Town Clerk's office and may be examined there during
regular office hours.
§ 198-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 198-26
1:163
Computation of sign surface area of individual signs of individually
mounted letters or symbols. When a sign is composed of
individually mounted letters or symbols, the sign surface area shall
be determined by means of the total of the smallest rectangle
that will encompass all letters, representation, emblems or other
display, including the wall area behind said letters,
representations, emblems or other displays.
(2)
Computation of sign surface area of multifaceted signs. The sign
surface area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed
by adding together the sign surface area of all sign faces visible
from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed backto-
back, or at no greater than 15° from one another, so that both
faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when
such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not
more than 42 inches apart, the sign surface area shall be computed
by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3)

extended.
(b)
On a lot which has a driveway or is next to a lot which has
a driveway, the two clear view triangle areas are formed by
the street right-of-way tine, both sides of the surface edge
ofthe driveway, and the line connecting points 20 feet from the
intersection of the street right-of-way line and driveway.
(c)

Orientation of signs on corner lots or through lots. When more than
one sign is permitted due to multiple frontages, each permitted
sign must be oriented toward its respective frontage and set at
least 100 feet distant from signs located on additional frontages,
unless specified otherwise. It is the intent to prohibit lots with
multiple frontages from combining sign rights so as to erect larger
signs or additional signs that are oriented to only one frontage.

Parking requirements.
It is the intent of this section that adequate off street parking
must be provided within reasonable distance to service all parking
demand created by new construction, whether through new
structures or through additions to existing ones or by change of use
creating higher parking demand.
(1)
Building, structures and land use in existence on the effective
date of these provisions are not subject to these off-street parking
requirements and may be rebuilt, altered or repaired, but not
enlarged or changed in use, without becoming subject to these
requirements.
(2)
In applying for building or occupancy permits, the applicant(s)
must demonstrate via a site plan drawn to scale that minimum
parking requirements set forth in Subsection B will be met. In
the Apartment/Multi-Family (RC), Park (P), Wetland Resource
Protection District (WRP), Business (B), Mixed Use (MU), or
Industrial (I) Districts, a special permit from the Planning Board
pursuant to § 198-29 will be necessary for the following:
[Amended 12-10-1992 STM by Art. 1; 6-8-2002 ATM by Art.

A change of use(s) or renovation(s) that would require the
addition of new parking space(s). If the existing parking spaces
can meet the new demand based on the change of use(s) or
renovation(s) then no special permit is required;
(c)
Re-striping of a parking lot of five or more spaces that changes
the existing site circulation, and/or number of parking spaces.
(d)
The minimums of Subsection B may be reduced on special permit
for an exception from the Planning Board, upon its determination
that special circumstances render a lesser provision adequate for
all parking needs. Examples of special circumstances include:
[Amended 5-2-1998 STM by Art. 27]
Use of a common parking lot for separate uses having peak
demands occurring at different times.

D.
Temporary moratorium on the sale and distribution of recreational
marijuana.
Purpose:
By vote at the state election on November 8, 2016, the voters
of the commonwealth approved a law regulating the
cultivation, distribution, possession and use of marijuana for
recreational purposes. The law provides that it is effective
on December 15, 2016, and the Cannabis Advisory Board is
required to issue regulations regarding implementation by
September 15, 2017.
(a)
Currently under the Zoning Bylaw, recreational marijuana
establishments and marijuana retailers are not permitted uses
in the Town. Regulations promulgated by the State Cannabis
Advisory Board are expected to provide guidance to the Town
in regulating recreational marijuana establishments and
marijuana retailers. Further, the ballot measure establishes
two important provisions that require action by the Town prior
to the adoption of zoning. First, the Town must determine
whether, and to what extent, it will exercise local control over
recreational marijuana establishments and marijuana retailers
and second, by ballot that cannot occur prior to November
6, 2018, the next biennial state election, on whether to allow
on-site consumption of marijuana products should the Town
decide to allow licenses for such facilities.
(b)
The regulation of recreational marijuana establishments and
marijuana retailers raise novel and complex legal, planning,
and public safety issues and the Town needs time to study
and consider the regulation of recreational marijuana
establishments and marijuana retailers and address such novel
and complex issues, as well as to address the potential impact
of the state regulations on local zoning and to undertake a
planning process to consider amending the Zoning Bylaw
regarding the regulation of recreational marijuana
establishments and marijuana retailers and other uses related
to the regulation of recreational marijuana. The Town intends
to adopt a temporary moratorium on the use of land and
structures in the Town for recreational marijuana
establishments and marijuana retailers so as to allow the Town
sufficient time to engage in a planning process to address the
effects of such structures and uses in the Town and to adopt
(c)

liquor purchase identification card as authorized by MGL c. 138, § 34B,
and issued by the Registry of Motor Vehicles for the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts or a valid operator's license issued by said Registry
pursuant to MGL c. 90, § 8, or on a valid passport issued by the United

presumed to have exercised due care in making such delivery or sale

herein shall affect the responsibility of the licensee not to serve any
person who is intoxicated.

§ 204-8. General rules and regulations.
The issuance of a license shall not be deemed a compliance by the
licensee with any other law or regulation. It is the licensee's sole
obligation to comply with any other laws or regulations. It is expressly
understood by the licensee that the local licensing authority, when
allowed by law, may take action against the licensee for failure to
comply with the provisions of other laws or regulations.
A.
By submitting any application required herein or under the provisions
of MGL c. 138, and by accepting any license granted, the licensee
or proposed licensee warrants and represents to the local licensing
authority that said licensee shall be in compliance with all rules,
regulations and laws governing the operation of their business prior to
selling any alcohol or alcoholic beverages under said license, including
but not limited to all Building Code requirements, occupancy
requirements and state and local health rules, regulations and laws,
and the licensee acknowledges and understands that the granting of
any such license is a condition precedent to the exercise of the rights
granted under said license.
B.
Nothing contained herein these regulations shall be deemed to entitle a
holder of a license to sell or deliver alcohol or alcoholic beverages other
than as provided for by the specific license granted.
C.
The issuance of licenses to persons who are not citizens of the United
States is subject to the requirements and prohibitions of the General
Laws. Corporations are advised to consult the General Laws regarding
the citizenship requirements for stockholders, directors, officers and
managers.

All sales records required by law shall be maintained and made
available to the local licensing authority as provided for by law. The

conspicuous place and made available to the local licensing authority
or its agents, and the licensee shall post in a conspicuous place all
notices and postings required by law pertaining to the sale, delivery or
consumption of alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
F.
The licensee shall keep all portions of the licensed premises to which
the public is granted access illuminated to such a degree as to ensure
safe movement of the persons legally on the premises and to provide
persons the ability to observe all such areas of the premises. In no
event shall the premises be illuminated to a lesser degree than may be
otherwise required by law.

§ 204-9. Effective date; applicability; amendments.
The licensee shall not permit or allow any person or persons to conduct
any illegal activity on the premises, whether or not such activity is in an
area to which the general public has access.
I.
The local licensing authority or its agents may at any time enter upon
the premises of any person or entity who is licensed by it to ascertain
the manner in which the licensee conducts the business carried on
under such license. All duly appointed police officers for the Town
of Fairhaven holding the rank of detective, sergeant or above shall
be deemed the authorized agents for the local licensing authority.
The Building Commissioner shall be deemed an authorized agent for
the purpose of inspecting the licensed premises to ensure compliance
with the floor plan required to be submitted by these regulations.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit any individual's
authority to enter the premises as may be otherwise provided for by
law. Additionally, the local licensing authority may appoint such other
individuals as agents as it deems fit.
J.
Any person who hinders or delays any authorized agent of the local
licensing authority in the performance of his/her duties, or who refuses
to admit or locks out any such agent from any place which such agent
is authorized to inspect, or refuses to give such agent such information
as may be required for the proper enforcement of MGL c. 138 shall be
punished as provided for under MGL c. 138, § 63A.
K.
After a hearing held in conformance with the applicable provisions of
law, if any license holder is found to be in violation of these rules and
regulations or the rules and regulations of the ABCC or any applicable
law, the licensing authority shall impose such minimum penalty or
penalties for violations of law or rules and regulations as provided for
in Appendix A of these rules and regulations, it being expressly stated
that the penalties provided for in said Appendix A shall be the minimum
penalty imposed for those violations listed, and the Board may impose
more severe penalties or take such other action as provided for by
applicable law if the Board determines the facts warrant the same.
In the event that there is found to be a violation of any said rule,
regulation or law, and no specific penalty is provided for in Appendix
A, the licensing authority will look to Appendix A as a guideline in
fashioning a penalty.
L.
These rules shall become effective January 1, 1995, and shall remain
in effect until rescinded, modified or amended by the local licensing
authority as set forth below; provided, however, that an amendment,
revision or insertion of any statute, act or resolve, or change of or
new rule of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, or vote of
Town Meeting which by its terms would rescind, amend, modify or be
applicable to these rules and regulations shall be deemed to have done

necessity of notice and hearing required under Subsection B.

Laws or the rules and regulations promulgated by the Alcoholic
Beverages Control Commission (or any succeeding authority), the
following rules of interpretation shall apply: the General Laws shall
prevail over all rules and regulations; the rules and regulations of the

HOUSEBOATS
§ 208-1. Mooring prohibited.
The Town of Fairhaven, MA, through the office of the Harbormaster and the
duly appointed agents of the Town of Fairhaven acting as the Harbormaster
and/or the Assistant Harbormaster, prohibit the mooring of any vessel that
is, after the determination of the Harbormaster, a houseboat to be placed
on a mooring within the waters of Fairhaven, MA.
§ 208-2. Disposal of human waste.
Houseboats, as determined by the Harbormaster as described above, are
not permitted to be at a mooring in the Town of Fairhaven. The disposal of
human waste is not allowed within the waters of Fairhaven. Porta potties,
and/or any other device onboard are not considered adequate to properly
hold and allow for proper disposal of human waste. The Town does not have
the ability or system that can accurately track disposal of human waste
brought ashore for proper disposal.
§ 207-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 208-3
1:273
§ 208-3. Description and limitations of vessels.
Vessels considered to be houseboats are vessels that, as determined by the
Harbormaster, are of the design that indicates they are not suitable to be
used to navigate the seas most likely encountered in the area waters due to
weather conditions. Because of this, they are at a mooring, and the design of
such allows for humans to live or sleep aboard. As opposed to recreational
vessels that can traverse the local seas in normal weather conditions and
have adequate pump-out systems for human waste, houseboats at moorings
cannot be pumped out by the Town of Fairhaven's CVA boats while at
moorings per the grant the Town operates under. This presents the problem
of human waste disposal.
§ 208-4. Violations and penalties.
Vessels that are determined to be houseboats by the Harbormaster and
moor in violation of this regulation are subject to the following: After
reasonable attempts to contact the owner by telephone or U.S. Mail over a
three-day period, it may be removed at the direction of the Harbormaster at
the cost of the owner. Cost will include all towing and storage charges that
may be incurred to do so. All charges are payable to the tow company which
will hold the vessel until payments are made.
§ 208-5. Applicability.
This regulation is applicable to both privately and commercially owned
moorings.

Developer procedure. The following are the steps a developer must
follow in having a subdivision made:
To save costly alterations to expensive detailed plans a relatively
undetailed preliminary plan should first be prepared and reviewed
with the Planning Board, Board of Health, and Board of Public
Works. (See § 322-13 of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land). An
engineer or surveyor will be best able to prepare this. The plan
should include the items listed in § 322-13 of Chapter 322,
Subdivision of Land, and be designed consistent with the standards
in Part 7, Design Standards, of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land.
(For statute, see MGL c. 41, § 81S.) [Amended 8-23-2011]
(1)
This preliminary plan should be submitted to the Planning Board
for approval. This means filing 10 sets of plans, the application
Form B37 and required fee (See Chapter 306 Fees.) with the
Planning Board's agent, a print of the plan with the Board of Health
and a notice stating the date of submission and a copy of Form
B with the Town Clerk (MGL c. 41, § 81S). The filing with the
Town Clerk may be by delivery or by registered mail. The day
of the next regular Planning Board meeting after filing with the
Planning Board's agent will be the date of submission. [Amended
8-23-2011]
(2)
The preliminary plan will be reviewed by the Planning Board, Board
of Health and Board of Public Works, and you can discuss with
them their suggestions for the definitive plan. The Planning Board
will take formal action on the plan and notify you of its action. (See
MGL c. 41, § 81S.)
(3)
You then should have your definitive plan drawn by an engineer
following requirements of § 322-14 of Chapter 322, Subdivision of
Land. [Amended 8-23-2011]
(4)
When it is ready, the plan is submitted to the Planning Board for
approval. This means filing with the Planning Board's agent the

original Mylar, 10 prints of each, a copy of application Form C,38
and required fee (See Chapter 306, Fees.) to pay for the hearing
notices and a list of all abutters taken from the latest tax lists. A
copy of Form C must be filed by delivery or by registered mail with
the Town Clerk. (See MGL c. 41, 81T.) One print of the plan is
also to be filed with the Board of Health. (See MGL c. 41, § 81U.)
[Amended 8-23-2011]
The Planning Board will then hold a public hearing on the plan
in accordance with § 322-14G of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land
(MGL c. 41, § 81T), which you or your representative should attend.
[Amended 8-23-2011]
(6)
Following the hearing, the Planning Board will act on the plan.
(Section 322-14I of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land, covers this.)
The security is either a covenant agreement (See Form D.39)
prohibiting building permits or the sale of any lots until the
improvements serving that lot are complete or a bond covering
the cost of improvements not yet made allowing the Town to use
the bond to complete improvements if the developer should fail to
do so or fail to do so quickly as agreed upon (MGL c. 41, § 81U.)
After it has security and after a twenty-day appeal period following
approval, the Planning Board will sign the plan. You must then give
them 10 prints of it (MGL c. 41, § 81V). [Amended 8-23-2011]
(7)
The required land improvements are then made in accordance
with your plan and consistent with Part 8, Required Improvements
for a Approved Subdivision, of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land.
[Amended 8-23-2011]
(8)
When improvements are completed or completed for any
substantial part of the subdivision, you may request a release of
your security. (See Form E.40) Release is requested in writing by
registered mail to the Planning Board with a copy by registered
mail to the Town Clerk (MGL c. 41, § 81U).
(9)
Release of all security discharges your obligation to the Town
under the Subdivision Control Law.41 However, it does not mean
that roads have been accepted by the Town, which is an entirely
separate procedure.

preliminary plans, when a subdivision application (Form C) and
definitive plans are submitted to the Planning Board, a review
fee for the use of outside consultants will be required. (See
Chapter 306, Fees.)
In hiring outside consultants, the Planning Board may engage
engineers, planners, lawyers, urban designers or other
appropriate professionals who can assist the Board in
analyzing a project to ensure compliance with all state laws
and Town regulations.
(b)
Funds received by the Planning Board pursuant to this section
shall be deposited with the Fairhaven Treasurer who shall
establish a special account for the purpose. Expenditures from
this special account may be made at the direction of the Board
without further appropriation. Expenditures from this special
account shall be made only in connection with the review
of a subdivision application for which a review fee has been
collected from the applicant. Failure of an applicant to pay
a review fee shall be grounds for denial of the subdivision
application by the Planning Board.
(c)
Review fees may only be spent by the Planning Board for
services rendered in connection with the subdivision project
from which they were collected. Accrued interest may also be
spent for this purpose. At the completion of the Board's review
of a project, any excess amount in the account, attributable to
a subdivision application, shall be repaid to the applicant or the
applicant's successor in interest. A final report of said account
shall be made available to the applicant's successor in interest.
For the purpose of regulation, any person or entity claiming to
be an applicant's successor in interest shall provide the Board
with documentation establishing such succession in interest.
(d)
Any applicant may take an administrative appeal to the Board
of Selectmen concerning the Planning Board's selection of an
outside consultant. The grounds for such an appeal shall be
limited to claims that the consultant selected has a conflict
of interest or does not possess the minimum required
qualifications. The minimum qualifications shall consist either
of an educational degree in or related to the field at issue or
three or more years of practice in the field at issue or a related
field. The required time limit for action upon the application
by the Planning Board shall be extended by the duration of the
administrative appeal. In the event that no decision is made by
the Board of Selectmen within one month following the filing
of the appeal, the selection made by the Planning Board shall
stand.

§ 316-5. Street acceptances. [Amended 8-23-2011]
When a preliminary plan is submitted, it must be carefully reviewed
for completeness (§ 322-13 of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land)
and conformity with your standards (Part 7, Design Standards,
Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land). It is a good idea at this stage
to discuss the plan with the Board of Public Works and any others
who will get involved. [Amended 8-23-2011]
(1)
Within 45 days of submission you must notify both the applicant
and the Town Clerk by certified mail of action on the plan. (MGL c.

Upon receipt of a definitive plan, the Planning Board must set up a
public hearing (§ 322-14 of Chapter 322, Subdivision of Land). The
Planning Board shall determine the date and advertise the notice of
hearing in each of two weeks, the first at least 14 days prior to the
hearing. The Planning Board will mail a copy of the advertisement,

and regulations shall be effective upon transmittal to the Town Clerk, the
Register of Deeds, and the Recorder of the Land Court.
The purpose of the establishment of subdivision control procedures in
the Town of Fairhaven is to secure for the Town benefits and protection
authorized by MGL c. 41, §§ 81K to 81GG, inclusive (the Subdivision
Control Law), as well as the protection and treatment of surface and
groundwater and the treatment and control of drainage, erosion and
sedimentation. The purpose of these rules and regulations is to specify
and make clear the procedures to be followed and the responsibilities
to be discharged in operations under the Subdivision Control Law. The
powers of the Planning Board under these rules and regulations shall
be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate access to
all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient
for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent
public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of
motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic, and
other emergencies; for ensuring compliance with the Fairhaven Zoning
Bylaw; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage,
utility services, fire, police, streetlighting, and other similar municipal
equipment, and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision;
and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and
with the public ways in the Town and with the ways in neighboring
subdivisions.
A.
It is the intent of these rules and regulations that any subdivision plan
filed with the Planning Board shall receive the approval of such Board
if said plan conforms to the recommendation of the Board of Health and
to these rules and regulations; provided, however, that the Planning
Board may, when appropriate, waive, as provided for in § 322-11, such
portions of these rules and regulations as is deemed advisable.

case of a nonresidential subdivision a preliminary plan is required.
A preliminary plan of a residential subdivision may be submitted by
the applicant to the Board of Health and to the Planning Board for
discussion and approval by the Planning Board. Preliminary plans
are required for nonresidential subdivisions and must be submitted
by the applicant to the Board of Health and to the Planning Board
for discussion and approval by the Planning Board. The submission
of such a preliminary plan will enable the subdivider, the Planning
Board and other municipal agencies to discuss and clarify the
problems of such subdivision before a definitive plan is prepared.
The degree of review and effectiveness of a Planning Board's
comments shall be in direct proportion to the accuracy and amount
of information provided by the applicant on the preliminary plan.
(1)
Staking of a subdivision. In order to facilitate on-site review by the
various reviewing agencies, the applicant shall, at the time of filing
of the preliminary plan, stake and brush cut to a minimum of five
feet of the center line of all proposed ways in the subdivision and
shall stake all points where lot lines intersect rights-of-way.
(2)
A.
Submission. Preliminary plans shall include the following information
and shall be filed with the Planning Board's agent.
The applicant shall submit 10 prints of the plans, accompanied by
two copies of a completed application Form B45 and the appropriate
fee.

(2)
D.
§ 322-13 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-13
1:318
Approval of the preliminary plan by the Planning Board does not
constitute approval of a subdivision, but does facilitate the
procedure in securing approval of the definitive plan. In addition,
such approval does not in any way authorize the owner to proceed
with construction of roadways and/or other work in the subdivision.
(3)
The Planning Board will not approve plans until issues relating
to road layout, road alignment, intersections with existing streets,
vehicular and nonvehicular connections to adjoining properties,
and general project issues have been satisfactorily addressed.
Other strictly engineering issues, such as detailed drainage, water
and sewer engineering, may be addressed at the definitive stage.
If the applicant does not provide engineering analysis at the
preliminary stage, however, the Planning Board will not be able
to provide feedback, and any approval is based on the applicant
being able to satisfactorily address these issues at the definitive
plan stage.

and recreation, historical archeological features, fisheries and
wildlife, water pollution, water supplies.
(1)
Development impact statements: required for subdivisions 20 acres
or greater. The developer shall submit an analysis of the impact of
the proposed development by qualified professionals. Each of the
sections of said analysis (water, sewer, etc.) shall be presented as
a separate document so that it can be forwarded by the Planning
Board to the appropriate Town department for review. The purpose
of said analysis is to assist the Town in assessing the cumulative
impact of development of the Town. Regardless of the above, the
(2)
D.
§ 322-14 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-14
1:324
Planning Board's decision shall be based on criteria set in these
regulations:
Water and sewer:
Projected generation of sewage based on standards in 314
CMR by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection.
[1]
Projected consumption of water based on standards in
"DESIGN," latest edition, Elwyn E. Seelye, or other
respected reference source.
[2]
[3] Fire flow standards cited in these regulations.
Explain impacts of project on sewerage facilities, public
water facilities (including impacts on fire flow
requirements), and on private facilities.
[4]
(a)
Public works:
Additional costs for future plowing and sanding per lane
mile (costs based upon average of past five years for BPW).
[1]
Cost of annual cleaning services (street sweeping and
catch basin cleaning) for the new street.
[2]
[3] Miles of additional pavement added by the subdivision.
(b)
Municipal services such as public works, police, fire, libraries,
recreation.
(c)
Schools.
For purposes of future planning, to provide leeway for
expected changes in school enrollment, the school
enrollment impact analysis should utilize the following
ratios adjusted to housing type:
[a] Single-family detached homes: 0.75 child per unit.
Single-family attached homes (townhouse/rowhouse):
0.5 child per unit.
[b]
[c] Multifamily structures (per unit): 0.375 child per unit.
[1]
The standards used in calculating impacts should be
carefully documented and fully referenced.
[2]
(d)
Traffic study: traffic analysis and mitigation: required for
subdivisions 20 acres or greater. The applicant shall submit traffic
analysis using "Trip Generation Standards" by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers: explain traffic impacts, types of streets,
opportunity for public transit access, impacts on vehicle,
pedestrian, and bicycle circulation.
(3)
§ 322-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-14
1:325
Estimated daily and peak hour vehicle trips generated by the
proposed use, traffic patterns for vehicles and pedestrians
showing adequate access to and from the site, and adequate
vehicular and pedestrian circulation within the site. Previously
generated data may be used; however, it cannot be more than
two years old.
(a)
Traffic flow patterns at the site, including entrances and
egresses and curb cuts on site and within 200 feet of the site.
(b)
A detailed assessment of the traffic safety impacts of the
proposed project or use on the carrying capacity of any
adjacent highway or road, including the projected number of
motor vehicle trips to enter or depart from the site for daily
hour and peak hour traffic levels, road capacities, and impacts
on intersections. Said assessment may be based on the
proposed mitigation [in the plan required by Subsection D(2)
above]. Such analysis shall include incremental impacts at all
significant or constrained intersections where such impacts
may be measurable. Such analysis shall also include a
mitigation plan, as necessary, to mitigate such impacts,
including construction of improvements, payment in lieu of the
project's proportional share of such improvements, or other
soft solutions.
(c)
An overall network analysis showing how the project
distributes traffic and enhances the flow of the existing
network.
(d)
An interior traffic and pedestrian circulation plan designed to
minimize conflicts and safety problems.
(e)
Adequate pedestrian access, including provisions for sidewalks
to provide access to adjacent properties and between
individual businesses within a development.
(f)
Safe provision for school bus stops and, when appropriate,
public transit stops.
(g)
Demonstrate that the project, including any concurrent road
improvements, will not decrease the level of service (LOS) of
all area roads or intersections affected by the project below
the existing conditions when the project is proposed and shall
consider the incremental nature of development and
cumulative impacts on the LOS. The project proponent must
demonstrate that he/she mitigated all cumulative and
incremental traffic impacts. If requested by the applicant, the
Planning Board may accept in-lieu-of payments to fund a
project's proportional share of necessary improvements to
mitigate off-site traffic impacts, including provision of public
transit and pedestrian or bicycle paths, in lieu of requiring
off-site improvements, when it finds that such payments, in
(h)
§ 322-14 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-14
1:326
conjunction with funds from other projects or sources, will be
used to fund improvements to mitigate traffic impacts. The
Board may, in its discretion, allow minor drops in LOS when
roads have surplus capacity (For example, an A LOS might
drop to a B without mitigation.), but shall still consider
incremental and cumulative impacts of traffic impacts. The
Board may exempt residential projects that would have equal
traffic impacts if they were developed as an as-of-right
development without site plan approval and subdivision
approval. The applicant shall provide for mitigation of all
incremental traffic impacts to ensure that facilities are
adequate to accommodate such traffic on area roads.
Easements. Prior to the final plan endorsement, all easements to
be granted by the developer to the Town of Fairhaven shall be
shown on the subdivision plans with bearings and distances, and
their purpose shall be clearly stated. In addition, the applicant shall
submit easement documents, suitable for recording, deeding said
easements to the Town. The easements shall be submitted to the
Planning Board and to the Board of Public Works.
(4)
Restrictive covenants. The applicant shall submit all documents,
including, but not limited to, master deeds, restrictive covenants,
deed restrictions, shared land, detention pond, open space, and
recreation areas. A homeowners' association must be established
to maintain streets and infrastructure until and unless the streets
are accepted by the Town. Covenants must include the requirement
that the homeowners'/landowners' association or other entity
accept all responsibility under Town bylaws to keep all sidewalks in
front of open space associated with the project free of snow. This
requirement shall apply even if omitted from a covenant.
(5)
Wetlands protection. In accordance with MGL c. 131, § 40, and
the Fairhaven Wetlands Protection Bylaw, Chapter 192, Wetlands,
no person shall remove, fill, dredge, or alter any bank, beach,
dune, flat, marsh or swamp bordering on any existing creek, river,
stream, pond, lake or any land under said waters or subject to
flooding without receiving a negative determination of applicability
or an order or conditions from the local Conservation Commission
and/or Department of Environmental Protection.
(6)
Construction costs. The applicant shall submit a detailed estimate
for all construction within the proposed roadway layout and/or
public utility easements, certified by the project's registered
professional engineer. Said estimate shall be based on the
"Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges," 1988 Edition,
as amended, of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and shall
include:
Quantity, item number, unit price and total amount for each
construction item.
(a)
(7)
§ 322-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-14
1:327

(d) Costs adjusted to add an inflation/safety factor of 20%.
Engineering inspection, materials testing, legal and other soft
costs.
(e)
Street-lighting. The applicant shall include a street-lighting plan
for the proposed street in the definitive plans. Said system shall
be in conformance with existing systems in the Town, as well as
with the local electric company street-lighting specifications. The
applicant is responsible for purchasing and installing all equipment
for said system, as well as ensuring that the system is the most
energy efficient. The street-lighting system will not be accepted by
the Town unless Town Meeting accepts the street. The applicant
shall include a complete street-lighting system for the proposed
street in the definitive plans prior to endorsement of those plans.
Said system shall be in conformance with existing systems in the
Town, as supplied by the local electric company.
(8)
Erosion/sedimentation control plan. In order to ensure, mitigate
and prevent erosion/sedimentation of disturbed areas during and
after construction activities, the developer shall submit a plan
showing, in detail, what and when such measures will be
implemented, on both a temporary and permanent basis, including
land disturbances for house construction. Any site disturbing more
than one acre must have a detailed stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) and an erosion control plan submitted
to and approved by the EPA or its designee in accordance with
EPA's NPDES Phase II regulations, the Town of Fairhaven's bylaws
governing such and § 322-26, Stormwater management,
Subsection E, erosion and sediment control plan.
(9)
Review by Board of Health as to suitability of the land. When a
definitive plan of a subdivision is filed with the Planning Board, the
applicant shall also file a complete copy of the submittal with the
Board of Health. The Board of Health shall, within 45 days after the
definitive plan has been submitted, report to the Planning Board, in
writing, with a copy to the person submitting the plan, approval or
disapproval of said plan, and in the event of disapproval shall make
specific findings as to which, if any, of the lots shown on such plan
cannot be used for building sites without injury to the public health and
include such specific findings and the reasons therefor in such report,
and where possible, shall make recommendations for the adjustment
thereof. Failure to report shall be deemed approval by the Board of
Health.
E.
Staking of a subdivision. In order to facilitate on-site review by the
various reviewing agencies, the applicant shall, at the time of filing of
the definitive plan, stake and brush cut to a minimum of five feet of the
F.
§ 322-14 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-14
1:328
center line of all proposed ways in the subdivision and shall stake all
points where lot lines intersect rights-of-way.
Public hearing. Before approval, modification and approval, or
disapproval of the definitive plan is given, a public hearing shall be
held by the Planning Board in accordance with MGL c. 41, § 81T. The
Board may extend the period permitted by statute between submission
of a definitive plan and action thereon upon written request of the
applicant. The applicant or representative shall be present at the
hearing, unless a written request is submitted.
G.
Review by other officials. Before Planning Board action is taken on a
definitive plan, the Board shall have submitted copies of the plan to the
Board of Public Works, Board of Health, Fire and Police Departments,
Conservation Commission and any other interested Town official for
their comments and recommendations. It is recommended that the
applicant meet with the Fire Department and Board of Public Works
prior to submitting a definitive plan.
H.
Certification of approval.
The action of the Board in respect to such plan shall be by vote,
copies of which shall be certified and filed with the Town Clerk and
sent by mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant at his/her address
as stated on the application. If the Board modifies or disapproves
such plan, it shall state in its vote the reasons for its action. Final
approval, if granted, shall be endorsed on the Mylar and/or the
original reproducible of the definitive plan by the signatures of a
majority of the Board (or by the signature of the person officially
authorized by the Board) but not until the statutory twenty-day
appeal period has elapsed following the filing of the certificate
of the action of the Board with the Town Clerk and said Clerk
has notified the Board that no appeal has been filed, or if appeal
has been taken, not until the entry of a final decree of the court
sustaining the approval of such plan. After the definitive plan has
been approved and endorsed, the applicant shall furnish the Board
with five prints thereof.
(1)
Final approval of the definitive plan does not constitute the laying
out or acceptance by the Town of streets within a subdivision. Such
laying out or acceptance shall be by action of the Town Meeting
upon recommendation of the Planning Board, Board of Selectmen
and the Board of Public Works.
(2)
Any amended plans, which are resubmitted for approval, shall
follow the same procedures as the original submission (filing fee,
public hearing, etc.). Any amended plans submitted later than
three months following the date of the expiration of the appeal
period or appeal(s) on the disapproval of the originally submitted
plan must conform to the Subdivision Rules and Regulations and
(3)
I.
§ 322-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-14
1:329
procedures (filing fee, public hearing, etc.) that are in effect at the
time of the amended plan's filing.
Failure of the developer to record the definitive plan within six months
of its endorsement, or to either initiate construction of improvements
or sell lots in a subdivision or major portion thereof within seven years
of the approval of the definitive plan, shall constitute sufficient reason
for the rescission of such approval for the plan or major portion thereof,
in accordance with the requirements of MGL c. 41, § 81W.
J.
After endorsement, the applicant shall submit a CD-ROM or DVD
containing geographic data in accordance with the Standard for Digital
Plan Submittals to Municipalities (Version 1.0) issued by the Office of
Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS).
K.
Performance guarantee. Before endorsement of the Planning Board's
approval of a definitive plan of a subdivision, the applicant shall agree
to complete the required improvements specified in Parts 7 and 8 for all
lots in the subdivision, such construction and installation to be secured
in accordance with MGL c. 41, § 81U of the Subdivision Control Law by
one, or in part by the other, of the following methods which may from
time to time be varied with the applicant.
Approval with financial performance guarantees (surety bonds,
money, three-party lender agreement, or letters of credit). The
applicant shall either file a surety company performance bond
or provide a deposit of money or negotiable securities, including
letters of credit, in an amount determined by the Planning Board,
in consultation with the Board of Public Works, to be sufficient to
cover the cost of all or any part of the improvements specified in
these regulations at state (or, if applicable, federal) prevailing wage
rates not covered by a covenant, Form D, and to cover the costs of
inspections, record plans, street acceptance plans, and legal work,
and a contingency/inflation factor of 20%. Warranty principal shall
be not less than 15% of the estimated cost of those components of
the entire project, which shall be dedicated for public use and shall
cover workmanship and materials.
(1)
Letters of credit, three-party agreement for lender retention of
funds, surety bonds and other financial performance guarantees
must be drafted so that the only requirement that must be met for
the Planning Board to draw on the letter is to notify the financial
institution (grantor) that:
(2)
L.
§ 322-14 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-14
1:330
"We have incurred liability by reason of the failure of the
applicant/developer/owner, within 90 days of the expiration of
this letter, to complete the construction of their project, (insert
name of subdivision and plans), in accordance with the definitive
subdivision plans and submittal, the subdivision approval, the
Fairhaven Zoning Bylaw, and the Rules and Regulations Governing
the Subdivision of Land in Fairhaven. The amount drawn, which
may be more than required to complete the project, will be held in
a segregated bank account until the work can be bid competitively
and the bid awarded and paid for or until the contract for the work
is otherwise let and the work paid for. Any excess over the cost of
completing the work will be returned to the grantor."
Such bond, deposit of money or negotiable securities shall be
approved as to form, the surety or financial institution, and manner
of execution by the Planning Board. For any surety bond:
The surety must agree that any litigation stemming out of the
bond will take place in Massachusetts.
(a)
The bond must include the name and address of the person to
be served for any legal action.
(b)
(c) The bond must specifically include the terms above.
No expiration date may be allowed on the bond, or, in the
alternative, the applicant must provide the Board with
adequate financial assurance that the bond will be renewed
and kept current until the project and warranty performance
period has been completed. The determination of whether or
not the financial assurance is adequate shall be in the sole
discretion of the Board.
(d)
(3)
Approval with covenant.
Instead of filing a bond or depositing money, the applicant
may fulfill a covenant Form D,48 executed and duly recorded
concurrent with recording the subdivision approval by the
owner of record, running with the land, that no lot in the
subdivision shall be sold and no building erected thereon until
such ways, services and, whenever applicable, temporary
turnarounds are constructed and installed, and until record
plans, street acceptance plans, and other required work are
accepted by the Planning Board in accordance with these rules
and regulations so as to adequately serve the lots.
(a)
Such covenant shall be a separate document referred to on the
plan and delivered to the Planning Board. Upon approval of
the covenant by the Planning Board, the applicant shall note
(b)
(4)
48.Editor's Note: Copies of Form D are available at the Planning Board's office and Town
Clerk's office.
§ 322-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-14
1:331
the Planning Board's action on the definitive plan, and the
applicant shall record the covenant, endorsed definitive plan,
and other appropriate documents at the Bristol County S. D.
Registry of Deeds.
Completion time schedule.
The performance guarantee, whether by bond, deposit of
money, letter of credit, or covenant, as previously described
herein, shall be contingent upon the completion of such
improvements, and the required one-year warranty as required
in these rules and regulations within a maximum period of
two years of the date of such bond, deposit of money, or
covenant. There shall be at least a three-month period between
the completion date of all improvements and one-year
warranty period and the expiration date of any bond, deposit
of money, or letter of credit. Said three-month period shall give
the Town the opportunity to collect the financial performance
guarantee so that it will be able to complete the necessary
improvements in case a) the developer is unable to do so; and/
or b) the Planning Board denies any requests for an extension
of time. "Warranty" shall include all workmanship and
materials.
(a)
Upon written request from the applicant, the Planning Board
may, at its discretion, grant an extension of time, and such
agreement shall be executed and affixed to the financial
performance guarantee or covenant.
(b)
In the case of a surety company bond, such an agreement for
an extension shall not be effective until the surety delivers to
the Planning Board a written statement that the surety agrees
to the proposed alteration of the completion schedule and that
such alteration shall not relieve or affect the liability of the
surety company.
(c)
Failure to complete all improvements as required by these
rules and regulations within the time allotted shall cause the
Planning Board a) to draw upon the performance guarantee
(surety bond, deposit of money, letter of credit) in order to
complete said improvements; and/or b) schedule a public
hearing in order to rescind approval of the subdivision in
accordance with appropriate sections of MGL c. 41, § 81.
(d)
(5)
Surety extensions.
When a subdivision is not able to meet the above requirement
of two years, then the security must be extended to a future
date certain. If requesting a subdivision security extension,
the developer of the subdivision shall be required to notify,
by certified mail, all residents, property owners and parties of
interest within the affected subdivision of the date, time and
(a)
(6)
§ 322-14 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-14
1:332
place of the Planning Board meeting at which the extension
request will be reviewed. The Planning Board will take all
parties' concerns in the review of such request, and a majority
of the Board will be needed to obtain approval.
All securities requests will be scrutinized at this time for their
financial stability, and more appropriate forms of securities
may be necessary. The surety company must be listed as
licensed to transact business in Massachusetts and shall
appear on the most recent list as published by the
Massachusetts Division of Insurance.
(b)
The Planning Board reserves the right to consult other
resources, such as but not limited to, state insurance
department, insurance agents, brokers, or other sources of
such information in determining solvency or financial strength
of surety companies. Requests for extensions of surety bonds
will trigger further proof of the above requirements to
determine continued solvency and financial strength.
(c)
Release of performance guarantee.
Procedures for partial release. The subdivider may, upon partial
completion and installation of required improvements in a
subdivision, as specified in these rules and regulations, request
the security for the performance of which was given by bond,
deposit of money, letter of credit, or covenant and make a formal
application, in writing, to the Planning Board for partial release of
his/her performance guarantee, in accordance with the procedures
set forth herein:
Financial performance guarantee. The amount of such bond, or
deposit of money, or letter of credit or three-party agreement
for lender fund retention, held may, from time to time, be
reduced by the Planning Board. The applicant shall present to
the Planning Board a list of all construction items performed
and/or completed, said list to be based on the subdivision
approval, and the subdivision regulations in their entirety. The
amount to be reduced by the Planning Board, after
consultation with the Board of Public Works, shall be based
upon federal or state prevailing wage construction costs at
the time the application for reduction is made. The Planning
Board shall withhold adequate funds to complete the project,
as approved, but shall withhold no less than 20% of the original
approved cost estimate. At the completion of the project (based
on a written acceptance from the Planning Board that the
project has been completed) and a one-year warranty period,
the amount withheld shall be released.
(a)
(b) Covenant.
(1)
M.
§ 322-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-14
1:333
The subdivider may request a release of conditions, Form
E,49 for lots where the required improvements have been
completed for that section of roadway beginning at any
intersection with a Town road and abutting lots up through
the last lot to be released. Lots may only be released if they
abut the completed portion of the road. No partial release
from the covenants will be approved if the total length of
roadway, including a temporary turnaround, abutting said
designated lots, exceeds the Town's maximum allowable
length for dead-end streets, as mentioned in § 322-16,
unless the Planning Board has already approved within the
limits of the development a dead-end street exceeding said
limits.
[1]
In the absence of financial performance guarantees,
adequate covenants will be held to insure completion of
the project, including record plans, street acceptance
plans, site inspections, and legal work. In addition, a
covenant on two lots, which can be built on, will be held
until all work in the subdivision, including the signing of
all necessary legal documents, has been completed.
[2]
Procedures for full release. The subdivider may, upon completion
and installation of required improvements in a subdivision, the
completion of record plans and street acceptance plans, as
specified in these rules and regulations, and the completion of
a one-year labor and materials warranty period, make formal
application, in writing, to the Planning Board for full release of any
outstanding performance guarantee.
Before the Planning Board releases the full interest of the
Town in said performance guarantee:
The Planning Board shall obtain, in writing, from the
Board of Public Works or from a registered professional
engineer chosen by the Planning Board, a certificate or
statement that all work required by these rules and
regulations has been constructed in conformance with the
approved construction plans. In the case where roadways
will remain under private ownership, the project's
registered professional engineer shall supply the abovementioned
certificate or statement.
[1]
The applicant shall present the Planning Board with letters
from the electric, telephone, gas and cable TV companies
stating that their respective underground systems have
been installed to their satisfaction.

Board, Board of Selectmen and the BPW, to the Town
Meeting for a formal street acceptance.
[4]
The applicant may be required to execute an instrument,
in a form approved by the Planning Board, transferring to
the Town or to an approved public utility company, without
cost, valid unencumbered title to all sanitary sewers,
water mains, and appurtenances thereto, and other
utilities constructed and installed in the subdivision or
approved portion thereof, and conveying to the Town or
to an approved public utility company, without cost and
free of all liens and encumbrances, perpetual rights and
easements to construct, inspect, repair, renew, replace,
operate and forever maintain such sanitary sewers, water
mains and other utilities, with any manholes, conduits,
and other appurtenances, and to do all acts incidental
thereto, in, through, and under the whole of all streets
in the subdivision or approved portion thereof, and if any
such sewers or water mains have been constructed and
installed in land not within such streets, then in, through,
and under a strip of land extending a minimum of 10 feet
in width on each side of the center line of all such sewers
and water mains. The Planning Board may require greater
than 10 feet in width on each side of the center line where
it deems necessary.
[5]
If the Planning Board determines that all improvements as
shown on the endorsed definitive plan and all required plans
and legal documents have been completed satisfactorily, it
shall release all the interest of the Town in such performance
guarantee and return the bond to the person who furnished the
same, or release the covenant, by appropriate instrument, duly
acknowledged, which may be recorded.
(b)
If the Planning Board determines after inspection that said
construction or installation has not been completed, or
wherein said construction or installation fails to comply with
these rules and regulations, the Planning Board shall send by
registered mail to the applicant and to the Town Clerk the
details wherein said construction or installation fails to comply

correct all problems mentioned in the above, or to request, in
(d)
§ 322-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-14
1:335
writing, a time extension. Failure of the applicant to finish all
the necessary work within said 30 days, or agreed upon time
extension, shall cause the Planning Board to draw upon the
bond or deposit of money as mentioned below.
Any such bond may be enforced and any such deposit may be
applied by the Planning Board for the benefit of the Town of
Fairhaven, as provided in MGL c. 41, § 81, upon failure of the
performance for which any bond or deposit was given, to the
extent of the reasonable cost to the Town of completing such
construction and installation.
(e)
Release of lots from covenant in exchange for bond or deposit of
money. The subdivider may request a release of lots from covenant
in exchange for a financial guarantee, provided that:
The lots run consecutively and are released on both sides of
the road simultaneously, beginning with the lots nearest any
intersection of the subdivision road and a Town road.
(a)
The amount of the financial guarantee and the financial
guarantee process shall be determined by the Planning Board,
as described above.
(b)
(3)
Deviation from approved plan.
After approval of any definitive plan, the location and width of ways
shown thereon, or any street or way subject to the Subdivision
Control Law, shall not be changed unless the plan is amended in
accordance with the provisions set forth in MGL c. 41, § 81W, as
amended, and approved by the Planning Board.
(1)
In the event the applicant desires to alter or change the grade of
a street or the size, location or layout of a storm sanitary or water
line or appurtenant structure, he/she shall:
Provide the Planning Board with a written statement
requesting such alteration or change.

(1)
The Planning Board may elect not to consider such revised plans
or other additional materials if such plans/materials are not filed
with the Planning Office at least 14 days prior to the date of the
public hearing or meeting at which the developer wishes them to
be considered. This is to ensure that the Town departments and
the public have adequate time to review and comment on said
materials.
(2)
After approval of any definitive plan, the location and width of ways
shown thereon, or any street or way subject to the Subdivision
Control Law, shall not be changed unless the plan is amended in
accordance with the provisions set forth in MGL c. 41, § 81W, as
amended, and approved by the Planning Board.
(3)
In the event the applicant desires to alter or change the grade of
a street or the size, location or layout of a storm sanitary or water
line or appurtenant structure, he/she shall:
Provide the Planning Board with a written statement
requesting such alteration or change.
(a)
Provide the Planning Board with three prints of the original
definitive plan with the proposed changes drawn on said prints
in red.
(b)
(4)
No change or alteration shall be permitted unless the Planning
Board has approved such change or alteration.
(5)
After approval of a change or alteration, the applicant shall cause
such approved changes to be shown on the record plans. (See
§ 322-48.)
(6)
Deviations from material and construction specifications shall not
be allowed, except as specifically authorized by the Planning
Board, upon consultation with the BPW and/or consulting engineer.

maintain said private ways and open spaces for the protection of
the lot owners in the subdivision.
In cases where a homeowners' association is required, there shall
be written into each deed for every building lot in the subdivision
a set of covenants and restrictions, the form and content of which
shall be subject to the review and approval of the Planning Board,
which shall provide for the following:
Establishment of a maintenance trust fund to be drawn upon
from time to time by the association to perform needed
maintenance and reconstruction of private roads, as well as
maintenance of common open spaces in the subdivision. Said
fund shall consist of two parts.
A maintenance endowment shall be established by the
developer in the amount of 10% of the construction
improvements cost, as approved by the Board, prior to
the release of any lot in the subdivision. The principal
amount of the endowment shall not be drawn upon by
the association for at least 25 years from the date of its
establishment, at which time it may be drawn upon for
maintenance or reconstruction of roads.
[1]
Annual maintenance deposits shall consist of interest
generated by the endowment and annual assessments
made to association members, the amount of such annual
assessment to be established by majority vote of the
association.

PART 7
Design Standards
§ 322-15. Purpose; general requirements.
Purpose: These standards are the minimum design standards. Good
construction will often be in excess of these standards. With any code
for design and construction, the engineer's design must guarantee and
be responsible to the adequacy and safety of the design. They cannot
merely meet minimum design standards. Again we use these design
standards as a check at the engineer's design, to ensure that minimum
public safety standards are met.
A.
Streets, sidewalks, water systems, sanitary sewers, storm drain
systems, public and private utilities and other infrastructure shall be
constructed in accordance with this chapter, the Board of Public Works
requirements and the editions of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Department of Public Works a) "Standard Specifications for Highways,
Bridges and Waterways," (to be referred hereto as the "Standard
Specifications"), b) "Construction Standards" on the date of the
subdivision application (to be referred to hereto as the "Construction
Standards"), and c) "Massachusetts Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Guidelines for Urban and Suburban Areas" in effect on the date of
submission of the subdivision application. If conflicts exist, the Planning
Board, in consultation with the BPW, and consultant engineer shall
determine which standard will be enforced.
B.
The subdivision shall be so designed as to protect the safety,
convenience and welfare of the occupants of the subdivision and the
Town of Fairhaven, through reasonable precautions against possible
natural disasters, provisions for traffic safety and convenience,
assurance of adequate sanitary conditions and consideration of
amenities. Proposed subdivision shall conform to overall development
plans and policies, which may be adopted by the Planning Board, and
shall adhere to the principles of sound planning and good engineering.
It shall be the responsibility of the Design Engineer for the adequacy
and safety of the design.
C.
No land shall be divided for residential use if it is of such a character
that it cannot be used for building purposes without danger to health.
D.
Nonbuildable lot. Any lot showing on a plan, which fails to meet the
frontage and/or minimum lot size requirement for the zone, shall be
required to show the following:
"No building shall be placed on lot ___________ without further
subdivision approval as provided for in MGL c. 41, § 81Y." The
preceding text shall be added inside the property lines on each lot
that is nonbuildable. Referencing notes on nonbuildable lots within
such property lines will be permitted only if the subject lot does not
contain space for the full text.
(1)
E.
§ 322-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-15
1:339
§ 322-16. Streets.
The Planning Board may allow the following text, when it appears
appropriate to allow building on the lot, subject to obtaining the
necessary variances from the Zoning Board of Appeals: "This lot is
to be considered nonbuildable."
(2)
All work and materials shall conform to the latest requirements of the
American Disability Act (ADA)50 and the Massachusetts Architectural
Access Board (MAAB). The ADA and MAAB regulations take precedence
over these regulations.
F.
The context of work required is as shown upon approved plans and is
in compliance with the Street Design Drawings in Appendix C.51 Stakes
shall be set which will indicate the exact amount of cut or fill.
G.
General provisions.
All streets in the subdivision shall be designed so that, in the
opinion of the Board, they will provide safe vehicular travel. Due
consideration shall also be given to the future residents of the
subdivision and to the attractiveness of the street layout in order
to obtain the maximum safety, livability and amenity of the
subdivision.
(1)
The proposed streets shall conform to the Master or Study Plan as
adopted in whole or in part by the Board.
(2)
Provisions satisfactory to the Board shall be made for the proper
projection of the streets, or for access to adjoining property which
is not subdivided or developed. It is the Board's policy not to
approve streets that do not connect to existing neighborhoods or
do not provide for connections in the future. A right-of-way from
the end of all culs-de-sac and dead-end roads to adjoining property
must be part of the street layout and must be shown on street
acceptance plans and deeds unless there is compelling evidence
that the adjoining property will never be developed. If the adjoining
property shall never be developed, there shall be a pedestrian and
bicycle trail up to the property line, unless wetlands and grade
make that impossible.
(3)
Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out
either directly opposite each other or with a minimum offset of
150 feet between their center lines. This minimum offset shall
also be observed whenever one or more streets entering opposite
sides of another street exist, whether located within or outside the
boundary of the proposed development.

51.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 322-15 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-16
1:340
Streets entering the same side of another street shall be laid out
with a minimum offset of 150 feet between their center lines.
This minimum offset shall also be observed whenever one or more
streets entering the same side of another street exist, whether
located within or outside the boundary of the proposed subdivision.
(5)
Temporary dead-end or cul-de-sac streets shall conform to the
provisions of alignment, width, and grade that would be applicable
to such streets if extended.
(6)
The center line of roadways shall coincide with the center line of
the street right-of-way, unless the Board specifically approves a
modification by waiver.
(7)
The center line of all intersecting streets or ways shall be a straight
line from the point of intersection of said center line for a distance
of no less than 100 feet.
(8)
On any street where the grade exceeds 5% on the approach of the
intersection, a leveling area, with a maximum slope of 3%, shall be
provided for a distance of not less than 50 feet measured from the
nearest gutter line of the intersecting street.
(9)
Vertical curves are required wherever the algebraic difference in
grade between center line tangents is 2% or more, with a minimum
length of vertical curve of 10 feet per one-percent change of grade
on minor streets and lanes, and 20 feet per one-percent change on
collector streets, or 100 feet, whichever is greater.
(10)
Reserve strips prohibiting access to streets or adjoining property
shall not be permitted, except where, in the opinion of the Board,
such strips shall be in the public interest.
(11)
Traffic calming: The street design shall make every effort to
reasonably calm the traffic within the subdivision and on
surrounding streets to ensure pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly
design and to prevent a decrease in traffic safety as a result of
the additional traffic the project will generate. Traffic calming
may utilize methods detailed in ITE's "Traditional Neighborhood
Development" or "Traffic Calming: State of the Practice," but must
utilize methods that will not make snow plowing or road
maintenance especially burdensome for the Town.
(12)
Grading and location of elements shall conform to the standard
cross-sections illustrated in the Street Design Drawings in
Appendix C.52

Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with the street design
drawings in Appendix C.55
A.
All sidewalks shall be handicapped accessible from the roadway at
all intersections. Wheelchair ramps to accomplish the above shall be
designed and constructed according to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Architectural Access Board Rules and Regulations, as
amended.
B.
All subdivisions with 10 or more lots located in an area where school
busing is provided or is likely to be provided in the future must provide
at least one bus waiting area for school children. This area must be
between 50 square feet and 100 square feet, depending on the size
of the subdivision (number of students generated). The waiting area
shall not include the width necessary to meet the sidewalk standards.
It must be constructed of cement/monolithic concrete; abutting the
outside edge of the sidewalk, and shall contain a bench. The location
shall be approved by the Planning Board. All subdivisions consisting of
15 or more lots must incorporate a bus shelter in addition to a bench.
C.
Where the street system within a subdivision does not connect with
or have, in the opinion of the Planning Board, adequate vehicular,
pedestrian, and/or bicycle access from a Town, county or state public
way or private way, the Planning Board shall require, as a condition
of approval of a plan, that such adequate access be provided by the
subdivider, and/or that the subdivider make physical improvement(s)
of access to and within such a way, in accordance with the provisions
for these subdivision regulations, either from the boundary of the
subdivision to a Town, county or state public way or private way, or
along such public way for a distance which, in the opinion of the
Planning Board, is sufficient to provide adequate access to the
subdivision.
A.
Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which a
subdivision has its access is considered by the Planning Board to be
inadequate to either provide for emergency services or carry the traffic
which is expected, in the opinion of the Board, to be generated by such
subdivision, the Planning Board shall require the subdivider to dedicate
a strip of land for the purpose of widening the abutting public way to

§ 322-19. Routes out of subdivision to be provided.
In any area not protected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hurricane
barriers, each lot shall be serviced with streets providing a route out of the
subdivision, no part of which route lies below the thirteen-foot elevation
above mean sea level (M.S. L.).
§ 322-20. Easements.
§ 322-21. Open space.
a width commensurate with that required within the subdivision and
to make physical improvements to and within such public way to the
same standards required within the subdivision or by these subdivision
regulations. Any such dedication of land for the purpose of the way and
any such work performed within such public way shall be made only
with permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over
such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall be
borne by the subdivider.
The Planning Board shall disapprove of a subdivision plan where, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, the existing surrounding municipal
infrastructure (e.g., street width and construction, sanitary sewer,
public water, storm sewer, etc.) is insufficient and/or incapable of
handling the additional volumes (e.g., traffic, sewage, stormwater, etc.)
anticipated, by the Planning Board, to be generated by the project. The
Planning Board may accept or require off-site improvements to mitigate
any of these impacts.
C.
Easements for utilities across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines
shall be provided where necessary and shall be a minimum of 20 feet
wide.
A.
Easements and provisions for vehicular access shall be provided along
the entire length of storm drain lines.
B.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, the Board may require that there be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way of adequate width to
conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, and to provide for construction or other necessary
purposes.
C.
Before approval of a plan the Board may also in proper cases require
the plan to show a park or parks suitably located for playground or
recreation purposes or for providing light and air. The park or parks
shall not be unreasonable in area in relation to the land being
subdivided and to the prospective uses of such land. The Board may
by appropriate endorsements on the plan require that no building be
erected upon such park or parks without its approval for a period of
three years.
A.
§ 322-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-21
1:343
§ 322-22. Fencing.
Fencing shall be required in subdivisions abutting limited or controlled
access highways or expressways, or other limited or controlled access
roads. Fencing may be required in other areas where physical features
require such safety.
§ 322-23. Guardrails.
Guardrails shall be provided at points of hazard along the roadway, such
as fixed objects and the pavement edge, high fills, fills on sharp curvature,
along watercourses, steep cliffs, along deep ditches in cuts and similar
locations as required by the MA Highway and Bridge Standards (4:1 slopes).
Type and installation of guardrails shall be approved by the BPW.
§ 322-24. Protection of natural features.
All natural features, such as large trees, watercourses, scenic points,
historic plots, stonewalls and similar community assets shall be preserved,
if, in the opinion of the Planning Board, they will add attractiveness and
value to the subdivision.
§ 322-25. Landscaping; street trees and tree belts.
If the Board requires the developer to set aside land for parks or open
space, it shall determine that such land is suitable for the intended
purpose with respect to soils, topography, drainage or other
characteristics, which could restrict the use of the site.
B.
Tree belts shall be provided on each side of the roadway in
conformance with the street design drawings, Appendix C.56 When
sidewalks are required, the tree belt shall be between the curb and
the sidewalk with the trees planted along the center line of the tree
belt. The finished grade of such tree belts shall have a slope of 1/
2 inch per foot toward the roadway. Where unusual physical land
characteristics of topographic conditions exists, and where no sidewalk
is to be constructed, the Planning Board may approve the construction
of a tree belt of a greater slope with the finished slope not projecting
above a plane sloped three horizontal to one vertical from the back of
the curb.
The top six inches of tree belt shall consist of good quality loam
extending to the right-of-way, screened, raked, and rolled with
lawn grass seed applied in sufficient quantity to assure adequate
coverage, rolled when the loam is moist and maintained until grass
cover satisfactory to the Planning Board has been established.
(1)
There shall be no small trees or shrubs, and no herbaceous plants
taller than one foot, within the tree belt.

§ 322-26. Stormwater management.
Street shade trees shall be on both sides of subdivision streets in
the tree belt when possible and otherwise within the right-of-way or
within five feet of the right-of-way. There shall be one tree planted
an average of every 30 feet of street frontage along each lot. Any
mature deciduous shade trees preserved may be applied toward this
average. The Planning Department and/or Tree Warden shall approve
the specific locations of the trees.
B.
Street trees shall not be permitted within 25 feet of the curbline of the
intersection of two streets.
C.
Trees shall be mature deciduous trees or newly planted trees of no
less than two-inch caliper measured six inches above soil root ball.
They shall be single-stemmed with a single, straight leader at time
of installation. All tree species must meet American Association of
Nurserymen Standards. Grouping is permitted, using both sides of the
sidewalk for tree planting, in order to frame or enhance a view.
D.
Street trees shall be deciduous shade trees, and no more than 35%
of any one species shall be used throughout the subdivision. The
recommended list of street trees is found in Appendix D.57
E.
Planting operations and requirements for street trees shall be in
accordance with the American Association of Nurserymen Standards
for Planting. The developer shall be responsible for maintaining the
health of trees until two growing seasons after plantings, the as-built
plans of the street are approved by the Board, or until the intended
public ways are accepted at Town Meeting. The Board may require that
surety be posted to replace shade trees that do not survive two growing
seasons. These standards shall be indicated on detail sheets.
F.
Stormwater management for each development shall accomplish the
following:
Reproduce, as nearly as possible, the hydrologic conditions in the
groundwater and surface water prior to the development;
(1)
Reduce stormwater pollution to the maximum extent possible using
best management practices (BMPs);
(2)
Have a long-term maintenance plan acceptable to the Board and
BPW;
(3)
(4) Be appropriate for the site given physical constraints.
A.
Submittal requirements. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant
to submit a stormwater management plan (SMP) for all subdivisions
greater than three lots detailing the existing environmental and
B.
57.Editor's Note: Appendix D is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 322-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-26
1:345
hydrological conditions of the site, proposed alterations of the site, and
all proposed components of the drainage system and any measures
for the detention, retention, or infiltration of water for the protection
of water quality and protection from flooding. The SMP shall contain
sufficient information for the Planning Board to evaluate the
effectiveness and acceptability of those measures proposed by the
applicant for controlling flooding and pollution from stormwater runoff.
The SMP shall contain maps, charts, graphs, tables, photographs,
narrative descriptions, calculations, plans showing construction details
of all systems and structures, and citations to supporting references,
as appropriate, to communicate the information as required by these
regulations. (See Appendix B for a list of required information.58)The
Planning Board reserves the right to require a SMP on subdivisions
of three lots or less if deemed necessary for flood control or pollutant
removal. The applicant shall submit a brief written description of how
the SMP complies with Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
Stormwater Management Regulations.
For subdivisions of three lots or less, the applicant's engineer shall
submit documentation, stamp and certify that the design meets the
DEP Stormwater Management Regulations.
(1)
Design standards. The design, construction, and maintenance of the
best management practices (BMPs), and the submittal of information
to evaluate the BMPs, shall be consistent with Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) Stormwater Management Regulations
and the standards and specifications of Appendix A59 of the "Rules
and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land, Fairhaven,
Massachusetts."
C.
BMP location. Stormwater basins and/or ponds shall be located only on
a common parcel used for service and utilities. Said BMP parcel shall
not be required to meet minimum zoning requirements for lot size or
frontage. However, at a minimum, a twenty-foot right-of-way shall exist
between the BMP parcel and the roadway. This common lot shall be
conveyed to the Town of Fairhaven at time of street acceptance.
D.
The applicant shall submit an erosion and sediment control plan.
The erosion and sediment control plan should include a written
description of the plan as well as an emergency response outline
(including response phone numbers) and a maintenance schedule.
The plan shall meet the following objectives and criteria:
Keep disturbed areas small: No more than 60 feet in width and
100 feet in length of a single lot, or five acres of the overall
tract at one time. Said plan shall identify design issues and

§ 322-26 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-26
1:346
methods employed to address such items as topography, soils,
vegetation, steep slopes, wetlands and water bodies.
Stabilize and protect disturbed areas quickly: Exposed areas
and stockpiles shall be revegetated within 40 days of being
exposed. The Board, depending on weather conditions, may
require slope and stockpile stabilization sooner. Methods for
stabilizing disturbed areas include mechanical, structural and
vegetative. In some cases, some or all of these methods should
be combined in order to retard erosion. These methods shall
be identified in the erosion and sedimentation control plan.
(b)
Keep stormwater runoff velocities low: Velocities of runoff
should be in the range of two to 10 feet per second. The
removal of the existing vegetative cover during the
development and the resulting increase in impermeable
surface area after development will increase both the volume
and velocity of runoff. These increases must be taken into
account when providing for erosion control.
(c)
Protect disturbed areas from stormwater runoff: Conservation
measures can be utilized to prevent water from entering and
running over the disturbed area. Diversions and other control
practices to intercept runoff from higher elevations, store or
divert it away from vulnerable areas, and direct it towards
stabilized outlets should be utilized. Selected measures should
be identified on the plan and in text.
(d)
Retain sediment within site area: The best way to control
sediment is to prevent erosion; however, sediment can be
retained by two methods:
[1] Filtering runoff as it flows and detaining sediment; or
Detain runoff for a period of time so that the soil particles
settle out.
[2]
(e)
Conveyance of stormwater.
The entire drainage system of storm drainage lines shall be capable
of conveying the twenty-five-year storm, including catch basins,
manholes and culverts.
(1)
Water velocities in pipes and gutters shall be between two and 10
feet per second. Water velocities in nonpaved areas (e.g. swales,
ditches) shall not be more than published values for maximum
permissible velocities based on surface cover type and soil types.
(2)
Water velocities in catch basins shall not exceed 1/2 foot per
second. Catch basins shall be designed (inlet capacity and spacing)
such that the flow in the gutter during a twenty-five-year design
storm is not more than three feet in width as calculated utilizing
(3)
F.
§ 322-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-26
1:347
methodologies described in "Drainage of Highway Pavements,
Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 12," as published by the U.S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. In
any event, water shall not be allowed to run for more than 300 feet
on paved surfaces.
Catch basins shall be Scituate-Rays precast or approved equal.
Catch basin grates shall be Lebarron Grate, Heavy Duty LF 246,
or approved equal. Catch basin grates shall be in the gutter to
facilitate snow removal.
(4)
Manholes shall be Scituate-Rays precast or approved equal.
Manhole covers shall be Lebarron Grate, Heavy Duty LA 246, or
approved equal.
(5)
The standard depth of catch basins shall be a minimum four feet
below the invert of the outlet. Manholes shall be constructed at
each junction point of storm drain lines. Catch basins shall not
serve as manholes.
(6)
Storm drains shall be of at least 12 inches in diameter inside, with
at least 24 inches of cover, and shall be of reinforced concrete Class
IV pipe if having less than forty-eight-inch cover within a street
right-of-way. Aluminum pipe of at least comparable strength may be
substituted in appropriate locations if approved by the Fairhaven
Board of Public Works (BPW). All drain pipes except subdrains
shall be reinforced concrete or ductile iron. Waivers from these
standards shall be allowed upon recommendation of the BPW.
(7)
Easements and provisions for vehicular access shall be provided
along the entire length of storm drain lines.
(8)
Roof drains; cellar drains or any other private non-preexisting
drainage systems shall not be allowed to connect to the Town's
existing drainage system, unless written approval from the BPW is
obtained.
(9)
On-site infiltration measures shall be used to approximate the
parcel's pre-development recharge.
(10)
The drainage system shall remove 80% of the average annual postdevelopment
load of total suspended solids (TSS).
(11)
Stormwater shall pass through an oil separator manhole prior to
release to an outfall.
(12)
Drainage outfalls shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly
to or cause erosion in wetlands or water bodies. A thirty-foot
buffer zone of existing vegetation shall be retained between all
point source discharges of stormwater and surface waters and
wetlands. However, the provision of this section shall not prohibit
the selective clearing of trees and shrubs, the establishment of
(13)
§ 322-26 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 322-26
1:348
new vegetation better suited to the proposed conditions, or the
discharge of stormwater across such buffer areas as any of these
actions may be permitted by the Conservation Commission under
the order of conditions.
Erosion and sedimentation controls (as identified on the approved
plans) shall be used during all construction phases.
(14)
Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed predevelopment
rates.
(15)
No increase in stormwater runoff over pre-development conditions
shall be permitted for all storms up to the one-hundred-year event.
(16)
Cross culverts. Culverts and stormwater outlet structures shall have
reinforced concrete headwalls designed in accordance with good
practice. At cross culverts (where a roadway bisects a stream or manmade
watercourse), drainage easements shall be established up
gradient of the culvert and delineated on the definitive plan based on
the projected one-hundred-year headwater elevation.
G.
Inspection. After the stormwater management system has been
constructed and before the performance guarantee for the development
has been released, the applicant shall submit an as-built plan detailing
the actual stormwater management system as installed. The consulting
engineer for the Planning Board and/or the BPW shall inspect the
system to confirm its as-built features. This engineer shall also evaluate
the effectiveness of the system in an actual storm. If the system is found
to be inadequate by virtue of physical evidence of operational failure,
even though it was built as called for in the definitive plan, it shall
be corrected before the performance guarantee is released. Examples
of inadequacy shall be considered but not limited to: errors in the
infiltrative capability, errors in the maximum groundwater elevation,
failure to properly define or construct flow paths, or erosive discharges
from basins. The cost of having the Planning Board's and/or the BPW's
consulting engineer review and evaluate the as-built plans and the
stormwater management system shall be borne by the developer.
H.
Maintenance. All stormwater management systems shall be maintained
in accordance with these regulations and Appendix A.60 The applicant
shall submit a maintenance plan for the stormwater management
system. The proponent shall provide copies of the stormwater
management plan to the Planning Board (10 copies). The applicant shall
be required to arrange for maintenance and inspection, at no cost to

The Town of Fairhaven has entered into an agreement with SEMASS
Partnership, the operator of a waste disposal facility, located in Rochester,
Massachusetts, pursuant to which the town must deliver, and SEMASS must
accept, a certain amount of waste for disposal. The town must pay a tipping
fee for waste so delivered, which fee is determined by the terms of the
agreement. The town must pay the agreed tipping fee if it delivers less than
a minimum tonnage. The town must pay market rate tipping fee if it exceeds
a certain maximum tonnage. In the interest of serving all of its residents,
the Town of Fairhaven wishes to make the opportunity to use the SEMASS
facility available to those persons licensed to remove waste in the Town of
Fairhaven. In order to enable the town to offer below-market rate disposal
to private haulers of waste generated in Fairhaven, the following regulation
is established.
§ 471-14. Determination of quantity of waste.
The Board of Health or its designated agent (hereinafter referred to as
the "Board") shall from time to time determine the quantity of waste
periodically generated in the Town of Fairhaven, which waste (hereinafter
"private haul waste") is removed for disposal by each person licensed
(hereinafter "licensee") by the Board of Health pursuant to MGL c. 111,
§ 31A. Each person so licensed may be required by the Board of Health to
provide any information requested by it in order to determine quantities of
waste generated by the customers of a licensee.
§ 471-15. Notice of election; bond.
Prior to the commencement of the deliveries of waste by the Town of
Fairhaven to the SEMASS facility, and upon the issuance or reissuance
of a license to haul waste, the Board shall deliver to each licensee a
written notification that he/she may elect to deliver private haul waste to
the SEMASS facility subject to these regulations. Any such licensee may
elect to deliver private haul waste to the SEMASS facility (hereinafter a
"participating licensee") by delivering to the Board within 14 days a notice
of election in a form provided by the Board (hereinafter "notice of election").
Such notice of election shall state the quantity of private haul waste which
the participating licensee shall deliver to SEMASS annually. That quantity
shall not exceed the quantity of waste determined by the Board for the
licensee pursuant to § 471-14 above. The notice of election shall be subject
to approval by the Board of the quantity of waste so designated in the notice
of election. Each participating licensee must produce a performance bond
whose amount shall be the assessed tipping fee for 1/3 the quantity of waste
designated in the participating licensee's notice of election. The assessed
§ 471-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 471-15
1:397
tipping fee shall be determined by the Board of Health from time to time,
but no less than once a year.

necessary passes or other identification documents necessary for use of the
SEMASS facility. The participating licensee shall be subject to all of the
applicable rules and regulations established by SEMASS, or by anyone so
authorized by SEMASS, for the operation and use of the facility.
§ 471-17. Commencement of delivery by private hauler.
A participating licensee shall commence delivery of private haul waste up
to the amount designated by him/her in his/her notice of election to the
SEMASS facility no sooner than the date designated to him/her in writing
by the Board. The participating licensee may deliver private haul waste to
the SEMASS facility subject to the same restrictions imposed upon the town
under the terms of its agreement with SEMASS. The town shall not be liable
to any participating licensee because of the failure or refusal of SEMASS to
accept his/her delivery of private haul waste for any reason.
§ 471-18. Responsibility of participating licensee for costs and
charges.
§ 471-19. Payment of bills; disputes.
A participating licensee shall be responsible for all costs incurred by
the town under its agreement with SEMASS, which costs are
attributable to the quantity of private haul waste specified by the
participating licensee in his/her notice of election to the Board. The
participating licensee shall pay the assessed tipping fee for waste
delivered by him/her to SEMASS. In addition, if the town is required to
pay tipping fees for waste not delivered, the participating licensee shall
pay a pro rata share to the extent he/she failed to deliver the quantity
of private haul waste so specified by him/her. If the town is required to
pay tipping fees for waste delivered in excess of the contract quantity,
the participating licensee shall pay a pro rata share to the extent he/she
exceeded the quantity of private haul waste so specified by him/her.
A.
The participating licensee shall be responsible for those charges made
by SEMASS to the town for delivery by the participating licensee of
waste unacceptable to SEMASS under its contract with the town, or any
other charges or costs incurred by the town as a result of the delivery
of waste or any other act or omission by the participating licensee.
B.
The town will bill the participating licensee promptly upon receipt of
any billing from SEMASS. The participating licensee shall pay any such
billing within 20 days of receipt of any such billing received from the
town. Any dispute concerning the amount of any bill may be submitted
in writing by the participating licensee to the Board along with payment

§ 471-15 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 471-19
1:398
§ 471-20. Amendment of notice of election.
The Board may, from time to time, review the quantity of waste designated
by a participating licensee in his/her notice of election to determine whether
it varies from the quantity of private haul waste actually removed by him/
her in the Town of Fairhaven. Upon the finding that it does so vary from
the quantity of such waste actually removed, the Board may amend the
participating licensee's notice of election by amending the designated
amount of waste to be delivered to the SEMASS facility. In its sole
discretion, the Board may at any time accept a notice of election from
any licensee who is not a participating licensee or may amend a notice
of election of a participating licensee upon his/her request, if it finds that
the participating licensee has changed the quantity of private haul waste
removed by him/her.
§ 471-21. Order by Board; appeals.
The Board or its authorized agent may issue such orders as it or he/she
deems necessary to further the purpose and provisions of this regulation.
A participating licensee shall comply with such order in every case. Any
person subject to such an order may appeal such order to the Board in
writing within seven days of receipt of the order. An appeal to the Board
from an order of the Board's agent shall be heard and decided by the
Board within 14 days of receipt of the notice of appeal. There shall be no
administrative appeal of an order issued by the Board after said hearing.

receipt shall be an absolute bar to the right of the participating licensee
to dispute the amount billed. The Board shall hold a hearing on any
disputed bill and issue its decision in writing within 30 days of receipt of
the written notice of dispute. Prior to any such hearing, the Board may
review and adjust any bill so disputed, and if adjusted to the satisfaction
of the licensee, as evidenced by his/her signature, no hearing need be
held.
Any bill by the town to a participating licensee which remains unpaid
20 days after receipt of the bill by the participating licensee shall
constitute a debt owed by him/her to the town collectible in an action in
contract. In any such contract action, a participating licensee who has
failed to follow the administrative procedure for disputing the amount
of the bill as set forth in this section shall have waived, and be barred
from raising as an issue, any dispute concerning the amount of the bill.
The contract remedy shall be in addition to any penalty which the town
may impose upon any person for violations of these regulations, and
exercise of the contract remedy shall not prevent enforcement of any
penalty under these regulations.

PART 1
General Provisions
[Adopted 5-31-1996 (Ch. XVI of the 1979 Regulations)]
§ 479-1. Rationale.
§ 479-2. Authority.
The Fairhaven Board of Health pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31, Tercentary
Edition and amendments thereto, adopts the following regulation governing
no smoking in municipal buildings" as a reasonable health regulation
designed to protect and improve the health of municipal employees and the
residents of the Town of Fairhaven.
§ 479-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to:
The 1986 Surgeon General's Report on the "Health Consequences of
Involuntary Smoking" clearly documents that nonsmokers are placed
at risk for developing disease as a result of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke or secondhand smoke. In 1993, the Environmental
Protection Agency classified environmental tobacco smoke as a known
human carcinogen. Further numerous studies have found that tobacco
smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing
secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in
nonsmokers. There exists conclusive evidence that tobacco smoke
causes cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, negative
birth outcomes, allergies, as well as irritations to the eyes, nose and
throat. Tobacco use is the leading cause of premature deaths in the
United States. Evidence further demonstrates that tobacco use is
extremely addictive.
A.
Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke presents a serious and
substantial public health risk. Of particular concern is the workplace
environment of nonsmokers, where they may be subjected to sustained,
involuntary exposure. Both smokers and those exposed to secondhand
smoke are at risk. At special risk are children, elderly persons,
individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive
airway disease.
B.
The Greater New Bedford Tobacco Control Program Advisory Board
(comprised of representatives of the Boards of Health from the Towns
of Dartmouth, Fairhaven and Mattapoisett and the City of New Bedford)

PART 2
Youth Access to Tobacco Products
[Adopted 4-14-1997]
§ 479-13. Rationale.
§ 479-14. Authority.
The Town of Fairhaven Board of Health, pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31,
Tercentary Edition, and amendments thereto, adopts the following
regulation affecting youth access to tobacco products as a reasonable
health regulation designed to protect and improve the health of its residents
and the general public.
§ 479-15. Purpose.
The purpose of this regulation is to establish restrictions on the sale and
distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products in order to reduce the
number of children and adolescents who use these products and to reduce
the life-threatening consequences associated with tobacco use in the Town
of Fairhaven.
§ 479-16. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this regulation, shall, unless the context
clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
BOARD OF HEALTH  The Town of Fairhaven Board of Health.
DISTRIBUTOR  Any person who furthers the distribution of cigarettes or
other tobacco products at any point from the original place of manufacture
to the person who sells or distributes the product to individuals for personal
consumption.
Tobacco use is a leading public health problem in the Town of Fairhaven
and throughout the United States, and there exists conclusive evidence
that tobacco smoke causes cancer, respiratory diseases, various cardiac
diseases, negative birth outcomes, allergies and irritations to the eyes,
nose and throat of both the smoker and nonsmoker exposed to
secondhand smoke.
A.
Furthermore, cigarette smoking and other tobacco use by minors
continues to be a problem with grave public health consequences.
More than 80% of all smokers begin smoking before the age of 18
(the legal age to purchase cigarettes in the commonwealth), and an
estimated 3,000 minors begin smoking every day in the United States.
In recognition of the United States Surgeon General's conclusion that
nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or heroin and that tobacco is an
initial drug preferred by young people and is associated with other drug
use, action is needed to curtail the easy access of cigarettes and other
tobacco products to minors.
B.
§ 479-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 479-16
1:407
EMPLOYEE  Any individual who performs services for an employer in

nonprofit entity or other organized group, including the Town of Fairhaven
and any department or agency thereof, who or which employs two or more
employees.
MANUFACTURER  Any person, including any repacker and or relabeler,
who manufactures, fabricates, assembles, processes or labels a finished
cigarette or other tobacco products.
MINOR  A person under the age of 18 years of age.
PACKAGE  A pack, box, carton or container of any kind in which cigarettes
are offered for sale, sold or otherwise distributed to consumers.
POINT OF SALE  Any location at which a consumer can purchase or
otherwise obtain cigarettes or other tobacco products for personal
consumption.
RETAILER  Any individual who sells cigarettes or smokeless tobacco
to individuals for personal consumption or who operates a facility where
vending machines or self-service displays are permitted.

services to the public.

the vending of cigarettes, cigars, tobacco or tobacco products upon the
insertion of coins, trade checks, swipe cards, slips or any other payment,

of Appeals for comprehensive permits granted under the Anti-Snob
Zoning Act (Chapter 774 of the Acts of 1969), MGL c. 40B, §§ 20-23, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. They are required by MGL
c. 40B, § 21, and by 760 CMR 31.02. The purpose of that act and
these rules is to facilitate the development of affordable housing in
Massachusetts. Further explanation of the background and purpose is
provided in the regulations of the Housing Appeals Committee, 760
CMR 30.01.
A.
These rules alone are not sufficient to describe comprehensive permit
procedures before the Zoning Board of Appeals. They must be read
in conjunction with and implemented in a manner consistent with the
complete regulations of the Housing Appeals Committee, 760 CMR
30.00 and 31.00, and with the Guidelines for Local Review of
Comprehensive Permits, published periodically by the Department of
Housing and Community Development. In addition, the Board's
regulations governing variances, special permits, and administrative
appeals for the conduct of hearings under MGL c. 40A apply to
comprehensive permit applications. In case of inconsistency or conflict
between those general rules for conduct and these rules, these rules
shall govern.
B.
These rules and regulations may be adopted and from time to time
amended by majority vote of the Fairhaven Zoning Board of Appeals
members present and voting, provided that such adoption or
amendment is taken after a public hearing on any proposed changes.
C.
These rules and regulations are effective when voted and a copy filed
with the office of the Town Clerk.65
D.
65.Editor's Note: These rules and regulations were filed with the Town Clerk 8-2-2006.

(5)
B.
§ 493-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 493-3
1:423
of 75 units. This cost is a reasonable estimate of the administrative
costs for counsel retained to assist the Board with the multitude of
legal issues that must be explored in the MGL c. 40B process. In
the event that such sum is insufficient to fund the necessary legal
services, the Board may require additional deposits. The Board, in
its sole and unfettered discretion, may waive any or all of this fee.
Alternatively, the applicant may opt to pay for the Board's legal
counsel in the manner prescribed by MGL c. 44, § 53G, or § 493-4
hereof.
Within seven days of filing of the application, the Board shall notify each
local official of the application by sending such official a copy of the
list required by § 493-3A(11), above, as well as any other information
that will enable such local official to assess the proposed project. Based
upon that list, it shall also invite the participation of each local official
who has a substantial interest in the application by providing such
official with a copy of the entire application.
C.
In order to allow review by local officials, the applicant shall provide
the Town Clerk 24 copies of the complete application for the following
boards, officials and departments for review: [Amended 5-7-2016
ATM by Art. 36]
The nine members of the ZBA

D.
The applicant shall provide to the Board for copying purposes one
unbound copy of the complete application and 11-inch-by-17-inch
copies of all plans (with match lines). The Board, at its sole discretion,
reserves the right to distribute the application to other municipal
departments or officials or to expert consultants for their review and

1:424
§ 493-4. Review fees.
advice, including, but not limited to, traffic engineering, civil
engineering, architectural, accounting, and legal counsel. The Board
reserves the right to require that the applicant, at his/her expense,
provide additional copies of the application.
When reviewing an application for, or when conducting inspections
in relation to, a comprehensive permit application, the Board may
determine that the assistance of outside consultants is warranted due
to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed project, because of a
project's potential impacts, or because the Town lacks the necessary
expertise to perform the work related to the comprehensive permit
application. Whenever possible, the Board shall work cooperatively
with the applicant to identify appropriate consultants and to negotiate
payment of the consultant fees. Alternatively, the Board may, by
majority vote, require that the applicant pay a reasonable project
review fee of a sufficient sum to enable the Board to retain consultants
chosen by the Board alone. The Board may require that an applicant
deposit a lump sum in order to retain consultants. In the event that such
sum is insufficient to fund the necessary consulting services, the Board
may require additional deposits.
A.
In hiring outside consultants, the Board may engage engineers,
scientists, financial analysts, planners, lawyers, facilitators, architects,
urban designers or other appropriate professionals who can assist the
Board in analyzing a project to ensure compliance with all relevant
laws, bylaws and regulations. Such assistance may include, but not be
limited to, analyzing an application, monitoring or inspecting a project
or site for compliance with the Board's decision or regulations, or
inspecting a project during construction or implementation.
B.
Funds received by the Board pursuant to this section shall be deposited
with the Municipal Treasurer, who shall establish a special account
for this purpose, consistent with the terms and provisions of MGL c.
44, § 53G. Expenditures from this special account may be made at
the direction of the Board without further appropriation. Expenditures
from this special account shall be made only for services rendered in
connection with a specific project or projects for which a project review
fee has been or will be collected from the applicant. Accrued interest
may also be spent for this purpose. Failure of an applicant to pay a
review fee shall be grounds for denial of the comprehensive permit
application.
C.
At the completion of the Board's review of a project, any excess amount
in the account, attributable to a specific project, shall be repaid to
the applicant or the applicant's successor in interest. A final report of
said account shall be made available to the applicant or applicant's
successor in interest. For the purpose of this regulation, any person or
entity claiming to be an applicant's successor in interest shall provide
the Board with documentation establishing such succession in interest.
D.
§ 493-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 493-4
1:425
§ 493-5. Public hearing and decision.
Any applicant may take an administrative appeal from the selection of
the outside consultant to the Board of Selectmen. Such appeal must
be made in writing and may be taken only within 14 days after the
Board has mailed or hand-delivered notice to the applicant of the
selection. The grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to claims that
the consultant selected has a conflict of interest or does not possess
the minimum, required qualifications. The minimum qualifications shall
consist either of an educational degree in, or related to, the field at
issue or three or more years of practice in the field at issue or a related
field. The required time limit for action upon an application by the
Board shall be extended by the duration of the administrative appeal.
In the event that no decision is made by the Board of Selectmen within
one month following the filing of the appeal, the selection made by the
Board shall stand.
E.
The Board shall hold its initial public hearing on the application within
45 days of its receipt. It may request the appearance at the hearing,
or at any subsequent hearing(s), of such representatives of a local
board as it considers necessary or helpful in reviewing the application.
In making its decision, the Board shall take into consideration the
recommendations of a local board.
A.
At the Board's discretion, the Board may establish a negotiating
subcommittee to negotiate with the developer to resolve site, massing,
technical, and buffering issues. The negotiating subcommittee shall
normally consist of the following: one of the members of the Board to
act as a liaison, the Planning and Economic Development Director, the
Building Commissioner, an independent mediator, the developer and/
or members of the development team, and any other representatives
of the Board's choosing. The Board's liaison will report back to the full
Board on the progress of negotiations. The actions and opinions of the
liaison and/or the negotiating subcommittee shall not be construed to
be binding on the full Board.
B.
The Board shall render a decision, based on a majority vote of the
Board, within 40 days after termination of the public hearing, unless
such time period is extended by written agreement of the Board and the
applicant. The hearing is deemed terminated when all public testimony
has been received and all information requested by the Board has been
received.
C.
The Board may dispose of the application in the following manner:
Approve a comprehensive permit on the terms and conditions set
forth in the application;
(1)
(2) Deny a comprehensive permit as not consistent with local needs; or
D.
§ 493-4 FAIRHAVEN CODE § 493-5
1:426
§ 493-6. Changes in application.
§ 493-7. Appeals.
Approve a comprehensive permit with conditions, including but
not limited to the number of permitted housing units; the height,
size, shape or general appearance of the proposed buildings; the
configuration of the site plan; and any other reasonable condition
that is necessary to address local concerns while not rendering the
construction or operation of such housing uneconomic. In order
to assist the Board with determining the permissible extent of
conditions, the Board may require that the applicant provide a
revised pro forma at the Board's request, during the latter stages
of the public hearing after the parties have had an opportunity
to review the proposed project and any revisions thereto. The
economic viability of a project may be determined with reference
to the average profit earned by other developers of residential
housing, as adjusted for the type of housing and the geographical
area.
(3)
It shall be the applicant's burden to demonstrate that the waiver of
any particular local regulation, bylaw or ordinance is necessary in
order to maintain the project's economic viability. There shall be a
presumption that the waiver of any local bylaw, ordinance or regulation
will adversely affect local concerns.
E.
In the event that, during the public hearing, the applicant proposes any
changes in his/her application or project plans that, in the Board's sole
and unfettered discretion, constitute a material or substantial change
to the project, the applicant shall provide a new site eligibility letter
from the designated subsidizing agency.
A.
In the event of material or substantial changes, the Board may request,
and the applicant shall provide, any and all information specified in
§ 493-3 hereof that is deemed by the Board to be necessary to evaluate
such changes.
B.
In the event of a material or substantial change, any and all plans
and supporting information shall be provided to all of the local entities
identified in § 493-3D, above.
C.
If the applicant submits a revised plan for the Board's consideration
and said plan is the plan that is the subject of the Board's hearing and
deliberation, then the application shall be deemed to be revised, subject
to the foregoing provisions.
D.
If the Board approves the comprehensive permit, any person aggrieved
may appeal within the time period and to the court provided in MGL c.
40A, § 17.
A.
§ 493-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 493-7
1:427
§ 493-8. When effective and recording.
§ 493-9. Performance guarantee.
As a condition of the comprehensive permit, the applicant shall post a bond,
or other form of surety, as a safeguard for performance, and/or a penal sum
in a form and amount acceptable to the Board, prior to the expiration of the
twenty-day appeal period, unless the Board shall specify otherwise. If the
applicant is not the owner and must purchase the property in question in
order to assume such obligations, or if another form of ownership or control
is in force, such person or entity shall comply with the provisions of this
section within 20 days following the date of such purchase or control. If said
performance guarantee shall lapse before completion and certification of
final inspection by the Board, a new guarantee shall be filed expeditiously
by the applicant/controller of the land and/or project. Sum of bond shall be
determined by the engineer or engineers as set forth by the Board to be
the total of cost of roadways, sewer or septic system, water system or wells,
parking areas, landscaping and such estimated by the Board's engineer.
§ 493-10. Severability of provisions.
The provisions of these rules and regulations are severable. If any provision
of these rules and regulations is held invalid, the other provisions shall
not be affected thereby. If the application of these rules and regulations
or any of their provisions to any person or circumstances is held invalid,
the application of these rules and regulations and their provisions to other
persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
Appendix
Chapter A501
If the Board denies the comprehensive permit or approves the permit
with conditions or requirements considered by the applicant to be
unacceptable, the applicant may appeal to the Housing Appeals
Committee as provided in MGL c. 40B, § 22.
B.
No comprehensive permit shall take effect until a copy of the decision,
bearing the certification of the Town Clerk that 20 days have elapsed
after the filing of the decision and no appeals has been filed, is recorded
in the Registry of Deeds and is indexed under the name of the owner of
record of the land.
A.
No comprehensive permit shall take effect until copies of the Board
of Health and Conservation Commission written decisions of approval
or a determination of applicability or order of conditions and until the
Fairhaven Board of Health certifies the wells and septic systems and
they all meet the relevant sections of Title V, bearing the date filed with
the Town Clerk, are recorded in the Registry of Deeds and are indexed
under the name of the owner of record of the land.

AN ACT ESTABLISHING IN THE TOWN OF FAIRHAVEN
REPRESENTATIVE TOWN GOVERNMENT BY LIMITED TOWN
MEETINGS.
Be it enacted, etc., as follows:
Section 1. Upon the acceptance of this act by the Town of Fairhaven,
as hereinafter provided, the selectmen and board of registrars of voters,
acting jointly, and hereinafter referred to as the districting board, shall
forthwith divide the territory thereof into not less than four nor more than
eight voting precincts, each of which shall be plainly designated and shall
contain not less than five hundred registered voters.
The precincts shall be so established as to consist of compact and
contiguous territory, to be bounded as far as possible by the center line of
known streets and ways or by other well defined limits. Their boundaries
shall be reviewed and, if need be, wholly or partially revised by the
districting board in November, once in five years, or in November of any
year when so directed by a vote of a representative Town meeting not
later than October thirtieth of that year. The Town clerk shall notify every
registered voter affected by a change in precinct boundaries or a change
in polling place.
The districting board shall, within twenty days after any establishment
or revision of the precincts, but not later than December twentieth of that
year, file a report of their doings with the Town clerk, the registrars of
voters and the assessors, with a map or maps or descriptions of the
precincts and the names and residences of the registered voters therein.
The districting board shall also cause to be posted in the Town hall a map
or maps or description of the precincts as established or revised form time
to time, with the names and residences of the registered voters therein;
and it shall also cause to be posted in at least one public place in each
precinct a map or description of that precinct with the names and
residences of the registered voters therein. The division of the Town into
voting precincts and any revision of such precincts shall take effect upon
the date of the filing of the report thereof by the districting board with the
Town clerk. Whenever the precincts are established or revised, the Town
clerk shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the state secretary,
stating the number and designation of the precincts. Meetings of the
registered voters of the several precincts for elections, for primaries, and
for voting upon any question to be submitted to all the voters of the town,
shall be held on the same day and at the same hour and at such place or
places within the Town as the selectmen shall in the warrant for such
meeting direct. The provisions of the general laws relating to precinct
voting at elections, so far as the same are not inconsistent with this act,
shall apply to all elections and primaries in the Town upon the
establishment of voting precincts as hereinbefore provided.
§ A502-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A502-2
1:439
Section 2. Other than the officers designated in section three as Town
meeting members at large, the representative Town meeting membership
shall in each precinct consist of the largest number divisible by three which
will not exceed five percent of the registered voters in the precinct. The
registered voters in every precinct shall, at a special election called for that
purpose, to be held not sooner than thirty days after the establishment of
precincts under this act, or at the first annual Town election held after the
establishment thereof, and at the first annual Town election following any
precinct revision where the number of precincts is changed, conformably
to the laws relative to elections not inconsistent with this act, elect by
ballot the number of registered voters in the precinct, other than the
officers designated in section three as Town meeting members at large,
provided for in the first sentence of this section, to be Town meeting
members of the town. The first third in order of votes received of members
so elected shall serve three years, the second third in such order shall
serve two years, and the remaining third in such order shall serve one year,
from the day of the annual Town meeting, or, in case such election is at a
special meeting, from the next annual Town meeting; in case of a tie vote
affecting the division into thirds, as aforesaid, the members elected from
the precinct shall by ballot determine the same; and thereafter, except as
is otherwise provided herein, at each annual Town election the registered
voters of each precinct shall, in like manner, elect one third of the number
of Town meeting members to which that precinct is entitled for the term
of three years, and shall at such election fill for the unexpired term or
terms any vacancy or vacancies then existing in the number of Town
meeting members in their respective precincts. The name of Town meeting
candidates for three-year terms and of candidates to fill vacancies shall be
listed together in one group on the ballot, and all three-year terms shall
first be filled in order of the votes received, then the vacancies for two
years, if any, in such order, and then any vacancies for one year. Upon
every revision of the precincts where the number of precincts is changed,
the terms of office of all Town meeting members from every precinct shall
cease upon the election of their successors. The Town clerk shall, after
every election of Town meeting members, forthwith notify each member by
mail of his election.
§ A502-2 FAIRHAVEN CODE § A502-2
1:440
Section 3. Any representative Town meeting held under the provision
of this act, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be limited to the
voters elected under section two, together with the following, designated
Town meeting members at large; namely, any member of the general court
of the commonwealth who is a resident of the town, the moderator, the
Town clerk and treasurer, the members of the board of selectmen, the tax
collector, the members of the board of health, the members of the school
committee, the members of the board of assessors, the members of the
sewer commission, the members of the park commission, the chairman of
the finance committee, the members of the planning board, and the tree
warden. All the foregoing shall be included within the general designation
of Town meeting members. The Town clerk shall notify the Town meeting
members of the time and place at which representative Town meetings are
to be held, the notices to be sent by mail at least seven days before the
meeting.
The Town meeting members, as aforesaid, shall be the judges of the
election and qualifications of their members. One hundred Town meeting
members shall constitute a quorum for doing business; but a less number
may organize temporarily and may adjourn from time to time, and at an
adjourned meeting seventy-five Town meeting members shall constitute a
quorum. Notice of every adjourned representative Town meeting shall be
posted by the Town clerk in at least one public place in each precinct,
and he shall notify the members by mail of the adjournment at least
forty-eight hours before the time of the adjourned representative Town
meeting. The notices shall state briefly the business to be acted upon at
any meeting and shall include notice of any proposed reconsideration. All
Town meetings shall be public. The Town meeting members as such shall
receive no compensation. Subject to such conditions as may be determined
from time to time by the representative Town meeting, any voter of the
Town who is not a Town meeting member may speak at any representative
Town meeting, but shall not vote. A Town meeting member may resign by
filing a written resignation with the Town clerk, and such resignation shall
take effect upon the date of such filing. No elected member whose official
position entitles him to be a member at large shall act as a member at
large during such time as he remains an elected member. A Town meeting
member who removes from the Town shall cease to be a Town meeting
member and an elected Town meeting member who removes from one
precinct to another or is so removed by a revision of precincts shall not
retain membership after the next annual election.
§ A502-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A502-2
1:441
Section 4. Nomination of candidates for Town meeting members to be
elected under this act shall be made by nomination papers signed by not
less than ten voters of the precinct in which the candidate resides, filed
with the registrars of voters for certification at least thirty-five days before
the election and filed with the Town clerk at least twenty-eight days before
the election; provided, that any Town meeting member may become a
candidate for re-election by giving written notice thereof to the Town clerk
at least forty-two days before the election. No nomination papers shall be
valid in respect to any candidate whose written acceptance is not thereon
or attached thereto when filed.
Section 5. The articles in the warrant for every Town meeting, so far as
they relate to the election of the Town officers, Town meeting members,
and, as herein provided, to referenda and all matters to be acted upon and
determined by ballot of the town, shall be acted upon and determined by
the voters in their respective meetings by precinct. All other articles in the
warrant for any Town meeting, beginning with the elected, shall be acted
upon and determined exclusively by Town meeting members at a meeting
to be held at such time and place as shall be set forth by the selectmen
in the warrant for the meeting, subject to the referendum provided for by
section eight.
Section 6. A moderator shall be elected by ballot for a three-year term,
and shall serve as moderator of all Town meetings, except as otherwise
provided by law, until a successor is elected and qualified. Nominations for
and election of a moderator shall be as in the case of other elective Town
officers, and any vacancy in the office may be filled by the Town meeting
members at a meeting held for that purpose. If a moderator is absent, a
moderator pro tempore may be elected by the Town meeting members.
§ A502-2 FAIRHAVEN CODE § A502-2
1:442
Section 7. Any vacancy in the full number of Town meeting members
form any precinct, whether arising from a failure of the registered voters
thereof to elect, or from any other cause, may be filled until the next annual
election by the remaining elected Town meeting members of the precinct
from among the registered voters thereof. Notice of any vacancy shall be
given by the Town clerk to the remaining members from the precinct in
which the vacancy or vacancies exist and he shall call a special meeting of
such members prior to any annual or special Town meeting for the purpose
of filling any vacancy. He shall cause to be mailed to every such member,
not less than seven days before the time set for the meeting, a notice
specifying the object, time and place of the meeting. At the said meeting
one third of the members from such precinct shall constitute a quorum,
and they shall elect from their own number a chairman and a clerk. The
choice to fill any vacancy shall be by written ballot, unless waived by a
two-thirds vote of those present, and a majority of the votes cast shall be
required for a choice. The chairman and clerk shall count the ballots and
shall make a certificate of the choice and forthwith file the same with the
Town clerk, together with a written acceptance by the member or members
so chosen who shall thereupon be deemed elected and qualified a Town
meeting member or members, subject to the right of all the Town meeting
members to judge of the election and qualifications of the members as set
forth in section three.
Section 8. A vote passed at any representative Town meeting
authorizing the expenditure of twenty thousand dollars or more, as an
appropriation other than Town charges, shall not be operative until after
the expiration of five days, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, from the
dissolution of the meeting. If, within said five days a petition, signed by not
less than five percent of the registered voters of each precinct, containing
their names and addresses as they appear on the list of registered voters, is
filed with the selectmen requesting that the question or questions involved
in such vote be submitted to the voters of the Town at large, then the
selectmen, within fourteen days after the filing of the petition, shall call a
special meeting, which shall be held within ten days after the issuing of
the call, for the purpose of presenting to the voters at large the question
or questions so involved. The polls shall be opened at two o'clock in the
afternoon and shall be closed not earlier than eight o'clock in the evening,
and all votes upon any questions so submitted shall be taken by ballot, and
the check list shall be used in the several precinct meetings in the same
manner as in the election of Town officers. The questions so submitted
shall be determined by a majority vote of the registered voters of the
Town voting thereon, but no action of the representative Town meeting
shall be reversed unless at least twenty percent of the registered voters
shall vote to disapprove such action. The questions so submitted shall be
stated upon the ballot in substantially the same language and form in which
they were stated when presented to said representative Town meeting by
the moderator as appears from the records of the said meeting. If such
petition is not filed within the said period of five days, the vote of the
representative Town meeting shall become operative upon the expiration
of the said period.
§ A502-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A502-2
1:443
Section 9. The Town of Fairhaven, after the acceptance of this act,
shall have the capacity to act through and be bound by its said Town
meeting members who shall, when convened from time to time as herein
provided, constitute representative Town meetings; and the representative
Town meetings shall exercise exclusively, so far as will conform to the
provisions of this act, all powers vested in the municipal corporation.
Action in conformity with all provisions of law now or hereafter applicable
