building, or premises shall fail or neglect, after presentation of a search
warrant, to permit entry therein by the municipal officer or employee.

Council or any commission, board or officer or employee of the City and does

exercised in light of the following standard:  The discretionary power to
grant, deny, or revoke any matter shall be considered in light of the facts
and circumstances then existing and as may be reasonably foreseeable, and due

   1.   Standard Civil Penalties.



      A.   First offense – not to exceed $750.00



      B.   Each repeat offense – not to exceed $1,000.00



   Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist constitutes a
repeat offense.



   2.   Special Civil Penalties.



      A.   A municipal infraction arising from noncompliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement, referred to in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8, by
an industrial user is punishable by a penalty of not more than $1,000.00 for
each day a violation exists or continues.



      B.   A municipal infraction classified as an environmental
violation is punishable by a penalty of not more than $1,000.00 for each
occurrence.  However, an environmental violation is not subject to such
penalty if all of the following conditions are satisfied:



         (1)   The violation results solely from conducting an
initial startup, cleaning, repairing, performing scheduled maintenance,
testing, or conducting a shutdown of either equipment causing the violation
or the equipment designed to reduce or eliminate the violation.



         (2)   The City is notified of the violation within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time that the violation begins.



         (3)   The violation does not continue in existence for
more than eight (8) hours.



3.04  CIVIL CITATIONS.



   Any officer authorized by the City to enforce this Code of Ordinances
may issue a civil citation to a person who commits a municipal infraction. 
A copy of the citation may be served by personal service as provided in Rule
of Civil Procedure 1.305, by certified mail addressed to the defendant at
defendant’s last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by
publication in the manner as provided in Rule of Civil Procedure 1.310 and
subject to the conditions of Rule of Civil Procedure 1.311.  A copy of the
citation shall be retained by the issuing officer, and the original citation
shall be sent to the Clerk of the District Court.  The citation shall serve
as notification that a civil offense has been committed and shall contain the
following information:



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[4])



   1.   The name and address of the defendant.

   7.   The penalty for failure to appear in court.



   8.   The legal description of the affected real property, if

   If the citation affects real property and charges a violation relating
to the condition of the property, including a building code violation, a
local housing regulation violation, a housing code violation, or a public
health or safety violation, after filing the citation with the Clerk of the
District Court, the City shall also file the citation in the office of the
County Treasurer.



3.05  ALTERNATIVE RELIEF.



   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this chapter does not preclude
the City from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same action. 
Such alternative relief may include, but is not limited to, an order for
abatement or injunctive relief.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[8])



3.06  CRIMINAL PENALTIES.



   This chapter does not preclude a peace officer from issuing a criminal
citation for a violation of this Code of Ordinances or regulation if criminal
penalties are also provided for the violation, nor does it preclude or limit
the authority of the City to enforce the provisions of this Code of
Ordinances by criminal sanctions or other lawful means.

   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the
actual, imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous
substance onto the land, into a water of the State or into the atmosphere
which creates an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety

   Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection,
dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the
hazardous substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the

notice setting a deadline for accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the
City will proceed to procure cleanup services and bill the responsible person
for all costs associated with the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished
within the deadline.  In the event that it is determined that immediate
cleanup is necessary as a result of the present danger to the public health,
safety and welfare, then no notice shall be required and the City may proceed
to procure the cleanup and bill the responsible person for all costs
associated with the cleanup.  If the bill for those services is not paid

costs of assessing the injury, destruction or loss.

the agents of the City in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous
condition caused by that person.

specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper
influences and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the
curfew hour.

(Ord. 11-07 - July 11 Supp.)




   5.   Enforcement Procedures.

evidence of the age of the minor, such as a birth certificate, driver’s
license or other government-issued identification, a law enforcement officer
encountering a person who he or she suspects of violating this chapter as a
minor shall use his or her best judgment in determining age.



      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody.  Grounds for
arrest are that the person refuses to sign the citation without
qualification; persists in violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper
identification or to identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate
threat to the person’s own safety or to the safety of the public.  A law
enforcement officer who arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the
minor in custody either in a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured
setting.  The officer shall not place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs,
on the minor unless the minor physically resists or threatens physical
violence when being taken into, or while in, custody.  A minor shall not be
placed in detention following a curfew violation, unless the officer refers
the minor to Juvenile Court Services for other charges or a judge has entered
an order allowing the child to be placed in detention.



      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult.  After a minor is
taken into custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the responsible
adult as soon as possible.  The minor shall be released to the responsible
adult upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.



      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision.  If a law enforcement
officer determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the
law enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other
person legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable
time, the law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an
adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or
another adult person who is known to the child.



   6.   Penalties.



      A.   Responsible Adult's First Violation.  Any responsible
adult as defined in this section who permits or allows the minor to violate
any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a simple misdemeanor. 
The fine for a first violation shall be $65. In lieu of issuing a criminal
citation, the law enforcement officer may, by certified mail, send to the
responsible adult, written notice of the violation with a warning that any
subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance
against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable penalties.



      B.   Responsible Adult's Second or Subsequent Violation.  Any
responsible adult as defined in this section who, following receipt of a
warning or citation for a first violation, permits or allows the minor to
violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction or a simple misdemeanor.



      C.   Minor's First Violation.  In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the minor is guilty of a simple misdemeanor. The fine
for a first violation shall be $65. In lieu of issuing a criminal citation,

states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties.



      D.   Minor's Second or Subsequent Violation.  For the minor's
second and subsequent violations of any of the provisions of this section,
the minor is guilty of a municipal infraction or a simple misdemeanor.



      E.   If the minor is placed in a shelter care facility, any
costs incurred by the City as a result of such placement shall be reimbursed
to the City. The Court may enter an order of restitution for such costs
against the responsible adult in a criminal proceeding under this section or
a personal judgment for such costs against the responsible adult in a civil
action under this section.




(Ord. 11-07 - July 11 Supp.)

smoke, use, possess, purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco
products, or cigarettes.  Possession of cigarettes or tobacco products by a

Notes

2 
†EDITOR’S NOTE:  A suggested form of notice for the abatement of
nuisances is included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances.  Caution
is urged in the use of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly
where cost of abatement is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to
whether or not a nuisance does in fact exist.  If compliance is not secured
following notice and hearings, we recommend you review the situation with
your attorney before proceeding with abatement and assessment of costs. 
Your attorney may recommend proceedings in court under Chapter 657 of the
Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

   Any person who, while operating a motor vehicle, strikes a domestic
animal in the City shall stop at once, shall render reasonable assistance,
and shall immediately report such injury or death to the animal’s owner. 
In the event the owner of said animal cannot be ascertained and located, such
person shall at once report the accident to the City.  This section shall in

   3.   The City may impound any animal if, upon taking its owner or
custodian into custody for any lawful reason, no other person or party can be
readily found to provide appropriate and adequate care and supervision to the
animal.  In such instances, the person in custody shall be notified of the
impoundment.



   4.   The person authorized to impound pet animals, upon receiving
any pet animal, shall make a complete registration for such animal, entering
the date, species, breed, color, and sex of such animal, any tattoo number or
other special characteristics, and whether licensed.  If such animal is

number of the license tag.  Not later than two days after the impounding of
any pet animal, the owner, if known, shall be notified of such impoundment.



   5.   The City, upon impounding of a dog or cat, shall record the
breed, color, and sex of the animal and whether or not it is wearing a
current license tag.  If the dog or cat is currently licensed, the City
shall enter the name and address of the owner or custodian and the number of
the license tag.  If the dog or cat is not returned to its owner or
custodian, the City shall make a reasonable and diligent effort to notify the
owner or custodian within 24 hours or as soon thereafter as possible by mail,
telephone, or personal notice that the dog or cat has been impounded and

impoundment of the owner’s animal, said owner has failed to claim and
redeem any such impounded animal, such animal may be adopted, transferred to
any State institution pursuant to the provisions for the purposes of Chapter
351A of the Code of Iowa, or humanely euthanized and disposed of.  In the
event that the owner is not willing to accept service by certified mail or by
personal service, then, after a period of seven days following the attempt to
make service on the owner, the animal control personnel shall have the right
and duty to dispose of said animal in the manner provided for by the City.



   7.   If a pet animal is not licensed, and if the owner is unknown,
it shall be the duty of the City to keep the animal for seven days from the
date that the animal is first picked up, and then said animal may be disposed
of as provided for in this section.



   8.   The registry of impounded pet animals not wearing a license tag

by the City that are not included or contemplated herein.



   2.   Any dog or cat impounded pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, when all conditions have been met for release, may be redeemed upon

sustenance, mutilate, beat, or kill such animal by any means which causes
unjustified pain, distress or suffering.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 717B.3)

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 717B.8)



55.23  LIVESTOCK.



   It is unlawful for a person to keep livestock within the City, except
in compliance with the City’s zoning regulations.



   1.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the keeping of
domestic chickens (members of the subspecies of Gallus gallus domesticus)
shall be permitted on single-family residences and zero-lot line duplexes
(where each unit owner owns a separate and distinct portion of the lot), so
long as such keeping is in strict compliance with this subsection and all
other applicable City ordinances unless, despite compliance with the
following, the presence of any particular chickens endangers the health,
safety, peace, quiet, comfort, enjoyment of, or otherwise becomes a public
nuisance to nearby residents or occupants or places of business.



      A.   No person shall keep chickens inside a single family
dwelling unit, multi-family dwelling units or rental units.



      B.   A tenant must obtain the landlord's written permission to
keep chickens, which shall be submitted as part of the application for a
permit.



      C.   Chickens must be confined in a coop or fowl house not
less than 18 inches in height or, in the alternative, within a fenced pen
area. Chickens must be kept within the coop, the fowl house, or the fenced
pen area at all times unless removed for a temporary time for cleaning or for
the safety of the chicken.  Chickens must be housed in the coop from dusk
until dawn.



      D.   The coop, the fowl house, or the fenced pen area shall be
located in the rear yard (as defined in Section 167.01) only, must be of such
a design to be reasonably expected to prevent entry by dogs, cats, or other
animals, shall be completely enclosed (except fenced pen area), shall be well
maintained, and shall be well drained so there is no accumulation of moisture.



      E.   The materials used in making a coop or fowl house
(stationary or mobile) shall be uniform for each element of the structure
such that the walls are made of the same material, the roof has the same
shingles or other covering, and any windows or openings are constructed using
the same materials.  The use of scrap, waste board, sheet metal, or similar
materials is prohibited.  Fencing materials must meet all requirements set
forth in the zoning regulations; however, except as set forth herein, coops
and fowl houses are not subject to building code requirements.



      F.   The coop, the fowl house, or the fenced pen area shall
have a minimum of four (4) square feet of floor area for each chicken but
shall not be any larger than twelve (12) square feet of area for each
chicken.  The coop, fowl house, or fenced pen area shall be a minimum of
fifteen (15) feet from any property line, shall not exceed eight (8) feet in
height, and shall fully comply with all applicable zoning regulations.



      G.   Any coop, fowl house, or fenced pen area shall be kept
clean, sanitary and free from accumulation of chicken excrement and
objectionable odors. All droppings and body excretions shall be either placed
in fly-proof containers and double-bagged in plastic bags or, in the
alternative, used as fertilizer on the same property or, with the owner’s
permission, on other property within the City, so long as the droppings and
body excretions are spread and incorporated into the soil within twenty four
(24) hours.



      H.   Odors from chickens, chicken manure or other chicken
related substances shall not be perceptible beyond the boundaries of the
permitted tract of land.  Noise from chickens shall not to disturb persons
on adjoining properties or beyond based on an objective or reasonable person
standard.



      I.   All chicken feed shall be stored in rodent-proof
containers.



      J.   No more than six (6) chickens shall be kept or maintained
per property.



      K.   All chickens shall have wings clipped at any given time
so as to eliminate the possibility of flight from the permittee’s property.



      L.   All such chickens must be hens; no roosters are permitted.



      M.   All chickens covered by a permit shall be banded in
accordance with procedures and requirements established by the City.



      N.   The City shall not be liable for injury or death of
chickens caused by dogs, cats, or other animals, domestic or wild, whether
such animals are licensed by the City or not.  Further, injury or death of a
chicken caused by an animal is not, in and of itself, sufficient grounds for
the City to determine that the animal is a vicious animal pursuant to Chapter
56 of this Code of Ordinances.  Any dead chicken, not caused by
slaughtering, shall be disposed of immediately upon discovering in a manner
so as not to cause a nuisance pursuant to Chapter 50 of this Code of
Ordinances.



      O.   Any slaughter of chickens not regulated by state law or
otherwise forbidden or regulated shall be done only in a humane and sanitary
manner and shall not be done open to the view of any public area or adjacent
property owned by another.



   2.   No person shall keep any chickens unless they possess a City of
North Liberty permit issued by the City Clerk.



      A.   The City Clerk shall provide an application form upon
request, which shall include consent forms for landlords and owners of
adjacent properties.



      B.   The fees and associated costs shall be set by resolution.



      C.   Permits will be granted for one (1) year valid from
January 1 through December 31.  Permits may be purchased at any time during
the year but will be valid only through December 31.  Bands will be issued
with the permit.  The permittee shall place and keep leg bands on all of his
chickens showing the permit number.



      D.   The applicant shall successfully complete an approved
class in raising chickens in an urban setting prior to being issued a
permit.  The Permitting Officer shall maintain a current list of such
approved classes.



      E.   Each chicken shall be banded at all times.



      F.   By the granting of the permit to raise chickens and the
application thereof, the permittee authorizes that the City or its agents
have the right to go onto permittee’s property any time and without prior
notice for the limited purpose of inspection of the premises to ensure that
all applicable conditions have been met.



      G.   Within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any
permit, the permittee shall apply for and secure a renewal of the permit in
the manner provided for in this chapter. Failure to renew a permit within the
time herein provided shall result in a delinquent fee, in addition to the
regular permit fee, as set by the city council. All applicants shall be
furnished with permit rules and regulations at the time the application is
made. Permit rules and regulations shall be approved by resolution of the
city council.



      H.   The permit is a limited license for the activity, and no
vested zoning rights arise from the permit being issued.



      I.   The permit does not run with the land.  Private 
restrictions  on  the  use  of  the  property  shall  remain 
enforceable and shall supersede the permit.  The private restrictions
include, but are not limited to, deed restrictions, condominium restrictions,
neighborhood association bylaws, covenants and restrictions, and rental
agreements. A permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private
restrictions that prohibit keeping of chickens is void.



   3.   In the event that an applicant or permittee does not fully and
strictly comply with the requirements of this section, the application may be
denied or the permit may be revoked.  If an application is denied or a
permit is revoked, the applicant or permittee shall be so informed in writing
and also informed of the right to appeal said decision.



      A.   In any instance where the City Clerk has denied, revoked,
suspended, or not renewed a permit, the applicant or permit holder may appeal
the Clerk’s decision to the City Administrator within ten (10) business
days of receipt by the applicant or holder of the permit of the notice of the
decision.  The applicant or holder of the permit will be given an
opportunity for a hearing. The decision of the City Administrator or any
decision by the Clerk that is not appealed in accordance to this chapter
shall be deemed final action.



      B.   When an application for a permit is denied or when a
permit is revoked:



         (1)   The applicant may not re-apply for a new permit
for a period of 1 year from the date of the denial or revocation unless the
denial or revocation is due to administrative reasons only, as determined by
the City Clerk.



         (2)   Any chickens shall be removed immediately.



         (3)   Any coop, fowl house, fencing or other structures
shall be removed within ten (10) days of the date of the permit being denied
or revoked.



   4.   An owner or possessor of animals on property that is newly
annexed has ninety (90) days from the date of annexation to bring the
property into compliance required by this section.



   5.   Any property owner possessing chickens in violation of the
City’s Animal Code prior to the date this ordinance becomes effective,
which is an illegal nonconforming use, shall have thirty (30) days to meet
all requirements of this section and all other applicable provisions of the
City’s code of Ordinances.

(Ord. 13-07 - July 13 Supp.)



69.10  SNOW EMERGENCY.



   The purpose of this section is to provide for a system whereby persons
are notified of snow emergencies.  Without such an ordinance, cars remain
parked on certain streets and effective plowing is curtailed.  Consequently,
parking places are hard to obtain and cars often park too far from the curb,
creating a hazard to other motorists.



   1.   A snow emergency shall automatically go into effect when snow
accumulation reaches two inches.  At such time as two inches of snow
accumulates on City streets, a snow emergency will go into effect and the
parking restrictions set forth herein shall be in effect immediately and
without further notice.  The City may provide additional notice of the snow
emergency as it deems appropriate and necessary.



   2.   In addition to the provision for automatic snow emergency set
forth in subsection 1 above, whenever the Mayor determines, on the basis of
falling snow, sleet, freezing rain, or on the basis of a credible weather
forecast, that weather conditions will make it necessary that motor vehicle
traffic be expedited and that parking on City streets be prohibited or
restricted for snow plowing or other purposes, the Mayor may declare a snow
emergency by notifying the City Clerk. 



   3.   No person shall park, abandon, or leave unattended any vehicle
on any public street during an automatic or declared snow emergency.



   4.   An automatic snow emergency shall take effect immediately when
snow accumulation reaches two inches.  A declared snow emergency shall take
effect at a time set by the Mayor but not earlier than two hours after it is
declared.  The Mayor shall declare a snow emergency by notifying the City
Clerk, stating the beginning time and, if known, the ending time for the snow
emergency.  If the office of the Clerk is closed, the Mayor shall file such
notice promptly when the office next is opened during normal business
hours.  The Mayor may cancel such declaration or change the beginning or
ending time.  Notice shall be given for such cancellations or changes in the
same manner as the original snow emergency declaration.  The City Clerk
shall ensure that notice of declared snow emergencies is promulgated in a
timely manner to the public by all appropriate means, as well as promulgate
by the same means the cancellation of any snow emergencies.



   5.   Enforcement and Towing.  Any person who violates the
provisions of this section shall be subject to criminal prosecution in
accordance with Chapter 70 and to civil enforcement in accordance with
Chapter 4.  Each 12-hour period that a vehicle is parked or allowed to
remain on any street in violation of this section constitutes a separate and
distinct offense.  Any vehicles found to be parked where not permitted
during a snow emergency may be impounded in accordance with the provisions of
Section 70.06.



   6.   Appeal.  A violation of this section may be appealed to the
City Administrator within thirty (30) days of the date of the violation and
prior to a complaint being filed in District Court.  In the event of a
timely appeal, the City Administrator shall conduct a summary review and then
either determine that the case will be enforced in accordance with the
provisions of this section and Chapter 70 or, in the alternative, order
administratively that the case be dismissed.



69.11  PARKING OF UNREGISTERED VEHICLES ILLEGAL.



   No person shall stop, stand, or park an unregistered vehicle upon
public property.  Only vehicles that are currently registered and have the
registration properly displayed on the rear license plate are permitted to be
parked on public property.



69.12  FIRE LANES.



   No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle on any designated fire
lane that would prevent such fire lane from being immediately accessible to
the Fire Department or in any other manner to deter or hinder the Fire
Department from gaining immediate access to the fire lane.  In addition to
parking being prohibited on fire lanes, any obstructions or structures on
fire lanes are illegal and subject to immediate removal by the City without
notice.



   1.   The Fire Chief shall establish and designate public and private
fire lanes as deemed necessary for the efficient and effective operation of
fire vehicles, personnel, and apparatus, subject to approval of the City
Administrator.



   2.   The owner of a property with a designated fire lane shall
maintain any fire lane as required by the Fire Chief for the purpose of
keeping the fire lane clearly marked and identifiable. Such marking, posting,
and maintenance shall be at the owner's expense.



   3.   Fire lanes shall be marked by signs, red curbs, or roadway
striping.  The design, specifications and placement of markings shall be
subject to approval of the Fire Chief.



   4.   Emergency vehicles parked on the established fire lanes shall
be exempt from this section.



   5.   A written request to the Fire Chief for temporary parking on a
fire lane shall be submitted for approval at least seven days from the
requested time period.  With prior approval of the Fire Chief and notice to
the Police Chief, such vehicles shall be exempt from this section.

80.02  AUTHORITY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.



   A police authority, upon the authority’s own initiative or upon the
request of any other authority having the duties of control of highways or
traffic, shall take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and
may take into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property.  The police
authority may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a
private entity, equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing,
preserving, storing, or disposing of abandoned vehicles.  A property owner
or other person in control of private property may employ a private entity
who is a garage keeper to dispose of an abandoned vehicle, and the private
entity may take into custody the abandoned vehicle without a police
authority’s initiative.  If a police authority employs a private entity to
dispose of abandoned vehicles, the police authority shall provide the private
entity with the names and addresses of the registered owners, all lienholders
of record, and any other known claimant to the vehicle or the personal
property found in the vehicle.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[2])



80.03  NOTICE BY MAIL.



   The police authority or private entity that takes into custody an

right to reclaim the vehicle and personal property within ten (10) days after
the effective date of the notice upon payment of all towing, preservation,
and storage charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody and upon
payment of the costs of the notice.  The notice shall also state that the
failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to exercise their right to
reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the time provided shall be
deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants of all right, title,
claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and that failure to
reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to the sale of the
vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a demolisher and to
disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction.  If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a police
authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity may
claim a garage keeper’s lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of
Iowa, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle.  If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity

rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the
planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters.  If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a
hearing or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property
within the ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants
shall no longer have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the
vehicle or the personal property.  A court in any case in law or equity
shall not recognize any right, title, claim, or interest of the owner,
lienholders or claimants after the expiration of the ten-day reclaiming
period.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])



80.04  NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.



   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity
and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section 80.03.  The published notice may contain multiple listings of
abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the
same time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for
mailed notice in Section 80.03.

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])



80.06  DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.

police authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether
or not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall
dispose of the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])



80.07  DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.



   The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is
found any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor
vehicle whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of
such motor vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without
notification procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more
wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally
inoperable.  The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of
authority.  The applicant shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a
junking certificate and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu
of the certificate of title.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])



80.08  PROCEEDS FROM SALES.



   Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law.  Any balance shall be held for the
owner of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and
then shall be deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund.  Where the sale of
any vehicle fails to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police
authority shall apply for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])



80.09  DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.



   Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor
vehicle for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish

or demolish a vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking
certificate issued for the vehicle.

full to avoid discontinuance of service.



92.04  SERVICE DISCONTINUED.



   Water service to delinquent customers shall be discontinued in
accordance with the following:



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



   1.   The Utility Billing Clerk shall notify each delinquent customer
that service will be discontinued if payment of the combined service account,
including late payment charges, is not received by the date specified in the
notice of delinquency. Such notice shall be sent by ordinary mail or
hand-delivered to the customer in whose name the delinquent charges were
incurred and shall inform the customer of the nature of the delinquency and
afford the customer the opportunity for a hearing prior to the discontinuance.

   The owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall
be jointly and severally liable for water service charges to the premises. 
Water service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien
upon the premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk to the County
Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



92.06  LIEN EXEMPTION.



   The lien for nonpayment shall not apply to a residential rental
property where water service is separately metered and the rates or charges
for the water service are paid directly to the City by the tenant, if the
landlord gives written notice to the City that the property is residential
rental property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges.  The

the City shall refund the deposit if the water service charges are paid in
full.  A change in the ownership of the residential rental property shall
require written notice of such change to be given to the City within ten
business days of the completion of the change of ownership.  The lien
exemption does not apply to delinquent charges for repairs to a water service.

93.08  Termination of Private Wells and Water Systems



 



93.01  REQUIRED CONDITIONS.



   Except as hereinafter provided, private wells and water systems shall
not be maintained by any individual or property owner, nor shall any new
wells be established within the City limits.  Private wells and water
systems shall be allowed only as set forth herein:



   1.   If no part of a tract of ground on which a private well or
water system is proposed is within 100 feet of a City water main.



   2.   If the property owner or individual applying for a private well
permit can show that denying the permit and not allowing the private well or
water system will cause the individual or property owner undue hardship. 
Undue hardship in this case means that the particular tract of land is so
topographically situated that connection to the City water main system would
be unfeasible and that the particular conditions causing the unfeasibility of
the connection are in no way caused or contributed to by the property owner
or permit applicant.  The Council shall rule on all questions of undue
hardship and their decision shall be final.



   3.   Under certain circumstances a shallow well, sometimes known as
a sand point, may be authorized by the Council, upon the applicant’s
entering into an agreement with the City which states that under no
circumstances will the well be used for furnishing a potable water supply,
that no connections to any property owner’s house will be allowed, and that
the well shall be used only for limited purposes.



93.02  REGISTRATION REQUIRED FOR EXISTING WELLS.



   The owner of any well existing at the time of the adoption of the
ordinance codified in this chapter is required to have the well registered
with the City Clerk.  The registration shall set forth the location of the
well, the property owner who owns the well, and the number of individuals and
description of properties that are using the well.  Owners of existing
private wells or water systems in the City must apply for and be granted a
private well permit.



93.03  PERMIT REQUIRED FOR NEW WELLS.



   All individuals who desire to construct or maintain a new private well
or water system in the City shall first make application to the City Clerk
for a private well permit.  The Council shall establish the contents of the
permit application by resolution.



93.04  ANNUAL TESTING.



   All wells, including existing wells and future wells, shall be tested
annually, and results of those tests shall be furnished to the City Clerk. 
An individual well owner may have a sample of the water taken to the nearest
place for testing, and a copy of that test shall be placed with the City
Clerk.  All annual tests shall be taken and completed during the month of
September of each and every year, but shall in any event be filed with the
Clerk on or before October 1 of each and every year.  If any owner of a well
fails to comply with this annual requirement, the City Clerk shall send
notice to said owner advising that within 15 days after receipt of notice, if
the well is not properly tested, the City will have the well declared
abandoned, and the owner will no longer be able to use the same.  Any owner
of a well who receives a test that indicates that there is not potable water
has a duty and an obligation to immediately advise the City to take steps to
terminate the use of that well, and if the situation cannot be corrected, the
well shall be abandoned forthwith.



93.05  NONRENEWAL OF PERMIT.



   In the event that any private well or water system does not meet the
health and safety regulations set forth herein, or if the owner fails to
obtain annually a test of the well, then the permit required under this
chapter shall expire, and the owner of the well or system shall immediately
stop using the well, until such time as the health standards are met and the
problem corrected.  In the event that the owner fails to make such
corrections, the well shall be deemed abandoned and the well owner is
required to take such action to make sure that the well is not used.  If any
existing well or water system is not used for a six-month period, or if the
private well or water system does not meet the health and safety regulations
set forth herein, then, at the expiration of the current private well permit
for the premises, the permit shall not be renewed unless all provisions of
this chapter are complied with.



93.06  HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS.



   All private wells and water systems for which permits are granted shall
meet the minimum health and safety standards as set forth by the appropriate
County and State health officials.  In addition, all permit holders shall
grant to the appropriate City official the right to inspect and test the
private well and water system maintained upon the permit holder’s
property.  Should the private well or water system so inspected not meet
minimum County or State health or safety standards for a continuous period of
six months, the private well permit shall be required to make connection to
the City’s water system under the terms of this Code of Ordinances.



93.07  FEES.



   1.   There is no charge for the initial registration and annual
renewal of well permits in the City.  In the event that a property owner

94.01  WATER SHORTAGE; IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTROL.



   From time to time, during and following drought conditions, the
aquifers which supply the water to the North Liberty municipal water utility
may become significantly and seriously depleted so that there will not then
be a sufficient supply of water to meet all customary and usual demands
indefinitely.  Under those conditions the Council may find and declare by
resolution a public emergency water shortage, during which time the following
measures and provisions shall be in effect to produce an orderly and suitable
curtailment of water consumption and shall be implemented as follows:



   1.   When the Council has been notified either by the Superintendent
or by the City Engineer that from an examination of City water supplies it
appears that the City would be entering a critical period, the Council shall
direct the City Clerk to send a notice to all customers of the water system
of the City containing a warning as to the condition of the water supply and
advising of the possibility that rationing measures may have to be
implemented and that if the critical condition exists, an additional notice
will be sent to all customers requesting that they voluntarily conserve water
usage in order to protect the City’s water supply.



   2.   In the event that the municipal water supply reaches the point
that it becomes critical and the Council is so advised, the Council shall
immediately, by special meeting if necessary, adopt a resolution establishing
that the procedures outlined in this chapter shall become immediately
effective.  Notice of said resolution and of this chapter shall immediately
be sent to all customers and notice shall also be given by use of the media
operating in the City.  Upon the adoption of said resolution by the Council,
the Superintendent shall also be fully prepared to establish a base
allocation for each water customer of the City and notification shall be
given of the allocation of water usage for that particular customer’s
office, business or residence, and the said customer shall have 30 days from
the date of the notice to appeal the base allocation.  Said appeal shall be
taken by filing a notice of objection with the City Clerk’s office at the
City Hall.



   3.   Either the Superintendent or the City Engineer shall, upon
determining that a water emergency no longer exists, or that the critical
period has passed, so notify the Council and the Council shall by resolution
cause the implementation of controls to be terminated.  Notice of the
termination shall be given to each customer.



94.02  BASE ALLOCATION.



   The base allocation of water for each customer shall be determined by
taking the usage for the period commencing November 1 through March 31 of
each winter period and from that base, determining the average monthly usage
for said customer.



94.03  APPEAL AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE BASE ALLOCATION.



   Any customer may file an appeal with the Superintendent to adjust the
base allocation amount.  The Superintendent may grant an adjustment to the
customer appealing based on the following criteria:



   1.   For single-family residential use, the base allocation may be
increased to 1,500 gallons per person per billing period for all individuals
residing at the applicant’s residence for a period of more than 30 days.



   2.   For commercial, industrial, institutional, or other residential
use, the base allocation may be increased based on factors appropriate to the
individual customer, such as the average of the water billed during the
previous winter (November 1 through March 31) and production, service,
occupancy data provided by the customer.



94.04  PREMIUM RATE FOR EXCESS CONSUMPTION.



   In addition to the water rates duly enacted by the Council, all
customers shall pay a premium rate of one cent per gallon of water consumed
in excess of the base allocation established pursuant to Section 94.02.



94.05  ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUM RATE CHARGES.



   Any customer may file for adjustment of premium rate charges with the
Superintendent.  The Superintendent may grant an adjustment of the premium
rate charges in accordance with the following criteria:



   1.   The cause of the high consumption was mechanical in nature
(such as broken or leaky pipes or fixtures) rather than human carelessness.



   2.   The customer shall furnish proof that the mechanical failure
was repaired promptly.  This should be in the form of a repair invoice or
statement or a materials receipt.



   3.   The adjustment shall be granted only for the billing period
prior to the correction of the failure.



   4.   For those accounts granted an adjustment of the premium rate,
the charge will be $5.00 plus normal rate.



94.06  PROHIBITED AND RESTRICTED WATER USES.



   During the period of any designated emergency under the terms of this
chapter, no person shall use the potable process water of the City’s water
treatment plant for the following purposes:



   1.   No outdoor watering or irrigation in any way whatsoever;



   2.   No car washing allowed within the City limits;



   3.   No water used to fill private swimming pools, children’s
wading pools, reflecting pools, or any other outdoor pool or pond of any kind
or description whatsoever;



   Provided however, water reclaimed or recycled after some other primary
use, such as water that has been used for washing, may be used without
restriction.  Additionally, water derived from sources other than City’s
municipal water utility, such as water condensed from the atmosphere by air
conditioners or sump pumps or collected from rain or snow, may be used
without restriction.



94.07  VIOLATION; PENALTY.



   Any person who, in making application to the Superintendent for
adjustment of the base allocation or premium charges, intentionally provides
false or incorrect statements or information shall automatically have his or
her request denied and shall additionally be liable to a penalty of $25.00
for the first offense and a penalty of $100.00 for the next and each
succeeding or additional violation.  In the event that any customer violates
any section of this chapter, the customer shall be given notice thereof and
the opportunity for a hearing within ten days after the notice, which hearing
shall be held before the Council.  If, after having said hearing it is
determined by the Council that said individual or corporation so charged has
violated this chapter, then the Superintendent is authorized to reduce the
flow of water and service to such customer and if the violation is flagrant,
to stop service to said customer when it has been determined that the
customer is using water in a manner not in accordance with this chapter.

the opinion of the Superintendent that such wastes can harm either the
sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or
constitute a nuisance.  In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of
these wastes, the Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as
the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage
treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of
treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent

preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.



97.07  CONTROL MANHOLES.



   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable
control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances
in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of
the wastes.  Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent.  The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the
owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.



97.08  TESTING OF WASTES.



   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable
samples taken at said control manhole.  In the event that no special manhole
has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken.  Normally, but not always, B.O.D., ammonia nitrogen,
sulfate, suspended solids, TKN, COD, TOC, and total FOG  samples are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's and temperature
are determined from periodic grab samples.)

101.05  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS. 



   1.   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. 
The City may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters
of the United States.  If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the City may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United
States, or to minimize danger to persons.



   2.   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any
person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have such
person’s MS4 access terminated, if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge.  The City will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of MS4 access.  The violator may petition to the City for a
reconsideration and hearing. 



   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the City



101.06  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.



   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES Iowa
Department of Natural Resources storm water discharge permit shall comply
with all provisions of such permit.  When an NPDES permit is required, a
copy of the permit shall be filed with the City.  Proof of compliance with
such permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City prior to the
allowing of discharges to the MS4.



   1.   Notice of Intent (NOI) Submittal.  The operator of a facility,
including construction sites, required to have an NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with such activity shall submit a copy of the notice
of intent (NOI) to the City at the same time the operator submits the
original NOI to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and EPA, as
applicable.  The copy of the NOI may be delivered either in person or by
mailing to:



   NOI to Discharge Storm Water



   North Liberty City Administration



   3 Quail Creek Circle



   P.O. Box 77



   North Liberty, IA  52317-0077



   2.   Notice of Intent (NOI) Offense.  A person commits an offense
if the person operates a facility that is discharging storm water with
industrial or construction activity without having submitted a copy of the
NOI and NPDES permit to the City.



101.07  COMPLIANCE MONITORING.



   This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges
associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.



   1.   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter.  If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements
to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.



   2.   Facility operators shall allow the City ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination,
and copying of records that must be kept under conditions of an NPDES permit
to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by State and Federal law.



   3.   The City shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge.



   4.   The City has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense.  All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



   5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the operator at the written or oral request of the City and shall not be
replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.



   6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a permitted
facility is a violation of storm water discharge permit and of this
chapter.  A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense
if the person denies the City reasonable access to the permitted facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.



   7.   If the City has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water is discharged, and the City is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.



101.08  USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   The City will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters
of the United States.



   1.   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at said owner’s expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and nonstructural BMPs.



   2.   Any person responsible for a property or premises which is or
may be the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at
the person’s expense, the BMP’s necessary to prevent further discharge of
pollutants to the MS4.



   3.   Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing discharge of storm water associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed a compliance with the
provisions of this section.



   4.   These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP) as required for compliance with the NPDES permit.



101.09  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.



   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes (or
such person’s lessee) shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow
of water through the watercourse.  In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.



101.10  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.



   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting in (or may result in)
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm
drain system, or waters of the United States, such person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such
release.  In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, the person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services.  In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, the person shall notify the City in person or by telephone or
facsimile not later than the next business day.  Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
City within three business days of the telephone notice.  If the discharge
of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence.  Such records shall be retained for at least three years.



101.11  NOTICE OF VIOLATION.



   Whenever the City finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the City shall order compliance
by written notice of violation to the responsible person.  Such notice shall
require, without limitation:



   1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed.  The notice shall further advise that,
should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a
contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.



101.12  APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.



   Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination
of the City.  The notice of appeal must be received within three days from
the date of the notice of violation.  Hearing on the appeal before the
appropriate designee of the City shall take place within three days from the
date of receipt of the notice of appeal.  The decision of the City or its
designee shall be final.



101.13  ABATEMENT MEASURES.



   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements
set forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within
the time set forth in the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the City, then representatives of the City shall enter upon the
subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property.  It is
unlawful for any person, owner, agent, or person in possession of any
premises to refuse to allow the City or designated contractor to enter upon
the premises for the purposes set forth above.  Within thirty days after
abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the
cost of the abatement, including administrative costs.  The property owner
may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within
15 days.  If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined
by the decision of the municipal authority, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.



101.14  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.



   It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter.  If a person has
violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the City may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person
from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.



101.15  COMPENSATORY ACTION.



   In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized
by this chapter, the City may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory
actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops,
creek cleanup, etc.



101.16  VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.



   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is
declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator’s expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or
otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.



101.17  CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.



   Any person that has violated or continues to violate this chapter shall
be subject to prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.  The City may

   There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa
corporation, hereinafter called the “Company,” and to its successors and
assigns the right and franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain and
operate in the City of North Liberty, Iowa, hereinafter called the
“City,” a gas distribution system, to furnish natural gas along, under
and upon the streets, avenues, alleys and public places to serve customers
within and without the City and to furnish and sell natural gas to the City
and its inhabitants. For the term of this franchise the Company is granted
the right of eminent domain, the exercise of which is subject to City Council
approval upon application by the Company. This franchise shall be effective
for a twenty (20) year period beginning on the effective date of the
franchise, provided, however, that either the City or the Company may, during
the first ninety (90) days following the tenth (10th) anniversary of the
effective date of the franchise, provide written notice to the other party of
its desire to amend the franchise. The parties shall negotiate these
amendments in good faith for a period of up to ninety (90) days following
receipt of notice. If, at the conclusion of the negotiation period, the City
determines in good faith that the franchise, if continued without amendment,
will have a material or significant adverse impact on the City or the
Company’s natural gas customers located within the corporate limits of the
City, the City may terminate the franchise. The City shall have the burden to
objectively demonstrate the material or significant adverse impact. †



110.02  RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.

restrictions and limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa (2011) or as
subsequently amended or changed.



110.03  PIPES AND MAINS.



   The Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for
the purpose of laying, relaying, repairing or extending gas pipes, mains,
conduits, and other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as
not to unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water pipes,
drains or sewers or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may
hereafter be located by authority of the City.



110.04  CONSTRUCTION AND RELOCATION.



   The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in the Company exclusively or in the Company and other
entities), in accordance with Iowa law including the Company’s tariff on
file with and made effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently
be amended (“Tariff”), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its
existing facilities or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or
alley in the City in such a manner as the City may reasonably require for the
purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or
repair of the street or alley.  The City and the Company shall work together
to develop a suitable alternative route or construction method so as to
eliminate or minimize the cost and expense to the Company for relocation of
its installations.If the City has a reasonable alternative route for the
street, alley or public improvements or an alternative construction method,
which would not cause the relocation of the Company installations, the City
should select said alternative route, or construction method.  All costs
associated with relocating the Company facilities within the City
right-of-way for public projects shall be borne by the Company.  This
includes, but is not limited to, relocation plans, surveying, staking,
seeding and restoration, and construction costs.  A “public project” is
one that is reasonably necessary for the public use of public ways of the
City.  If project funds from a source other than the City are available to
pay for the relocation of utility facilities, the City should attempt to
secure said funds and provide them to the Company to compensate the Company
for the costs of relocation.



110.05  EXCAVATIONS.



   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places
for the installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, the Company shall
not unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the
surface, restoring it to the condition that existed prior to excavation. 
The Company shall not be required to restore or modify public rights-of-way,
sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition
superior to its immediate previously existing condition or to a condition
required for the City to comply with city, state or federal rules,
regulations or law, but shall comply with applicable City ordinances and
design standards in its restoration activities.  The Company agrees any
replacement of road surface shall conform to current City code regarding
depth and composition.



110.06  UTILITY EASEMENTS.



   Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way
shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has natural gas facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide
the Company with not less than sixty (60) days advance notice of the City’s
proposed action and shall grant the Company a utility easement covering
existing and future facilities and activities.



110.07  RELOCATION COSTS NEGOTIABLE.

public right-of-way at the direction of the City within the previous five (5)
years shall be open for negotiation with the City.



110.08  RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.



   Pursuant to relocation of the Company facilities as may be required by
this franchise, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its
existing facilities or equipment in order to facilitate the project of a
commercial or private developer or non-public entity, the City shall
reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-public entity to
reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to
relocation of its existing facilities or equipment.  The Company shall not
be required to relocate in order to facilitate such private project at its
expense. 



110.09  INDEMNIFICATION.

claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses on account of injury or
damage to any person or property to the extent caused or occasioned by the
Company’s negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation
or maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise,
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend,
indemnify and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent
arising from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.



110.10    INFORMATION. 



   Upon reasonable request, the Company shall provide the City, on a
project specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location,
relative to boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or
over which it has control that is located in City right-of-way. The Company
and City recognize the information provided will, under current Iowa law,
constitute public records, but that nonetheless, some information provided
may be confidential under state or federal law or both.  Therefore, the City
shall not release any information with respect to the location or type of
equipment which the Company owns or controls in the right of way which may
constitute a trade secret or which may otherwise be protected from public
disclosure by state or federal law. Furthermore, the City agrees that no
documents, maps or information provided to the City by the Company shall be
made available to the public or other entities if such documents or
information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of
Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical Energy
Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, and
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be
amended from time to time.



110.11    APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. 



   The Company shall construct, operate and maintain its facilities in
accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its
successors.



110.12    QUALITY AND QUANTITY. 



   During the term of this franchise, the Company shall furnish natural
gas in the quantity and quality consistent and in accordance with the
applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors and Iowa
law.



110.13    FRANCHISE FEE. 



   There is hereby imposed upon and shall be collected from the natural
gas customers of the Company receiving service pursuant to the Tariff located
within the corporate limits of the City and remitted by the Company to the
City, a franchise fee from each revenue class as set forth below of the gross
receipts, minus uncollectable amounts, derived by the Company from the
delivery and sale of natural gas to customers within the corporate limits of
the City:



·   Residential Customers            zero (0) percent



·   Commercial Customers            zero (0) percent



·   Industrial Customers            zero (0) percent



·   Public Authority Customers          zero (0) percent

110.14    FEE EXEMPTIONS. 



   The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt certain types or classes
of sales from imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease or
eliminate the franchise fee. The City does therefore exempt the customer
classes or customer groups shown below from franchise fees. The City reserves
the right to cancel any or all the franchise fee exemptions and also reserves
the right to grant exemptions to additional customers or customer classes in
compliance with Iowa law and Section 110.15 of this chapter.



·   Customer classes initially exempted by the City:  None.



110.15    MODIFYING FEES. 



   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once
in any twenty-four (24) month period. Any such ordinance exempting certain
types or classes of customers, or increasing, decreasing, modifying or
eliminating the franchise fee shall become effective, and billings reflecting
the change shall commence, on an agreed upon date which is not less than
sixty (60) days following written notice to the Company by certified mail. 
The Company shall not be required to implement such new ordinance unless and
until it determines that it has received appropriate official documentation
of final action by the City Council.



110.16    COLLECTION OF FEES. 



   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees.  The Company will commence collecting
franchise fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first
calendar month following ninety (90) days from receipt of information
required of the City to implement the franchise fee, including the City’s
documentation of consumers subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise
fees. The City shall provide the information and data required in a form and
format acceptable to the Company.  The Company will, if requested by the
City, provide the City with a list of premises considered by the Company to
be within the corporate limits of the City.



110.17    IDENTIFYING CUSTOMERS.



   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customers subject
to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall be
solely responsible for notifying the Company of changes to its corporate
limits, including, over time, annexations, severances, or other alterations
thereto, and customers that it wishes to be subject to or, to the extent
permitted by law, exempt from paying the franchise fee. The City shall
provide to the Company, by certified mail, copies of annexation ordinances in
a timely manner to ensure appropriate franchise fee collection from customers
within the corporate limits of the City. The Company shall have no obligation
to collect franchise fees from customers in annexed areas until and unless
such ordinances have been provided to the Company by certified mail. The
Company shall commence collecting franchise fees in the annexed areas no
sooner than sixty (60) days after receiving annexation ordinances from the
City.



110.18    FRANCHISE FEE INDEMNIFICATION. 



   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising
out of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee,
except to the extent such claims result from the Company’s own negligence.
In addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees
from any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly
identified, by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being
subject to a different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the
imposition of franchise fees.



110.19    FEE REMITTANCE. 



   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following
each quarter as follows:



·   January, February and March



·   April, May and June



·   July, August and September, and



·   October, November and December



The Company shall provide the City with notice at least thirty (30) days in
advance of any changes made in this collection schedule, including any
alterations in the calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance
periods.



110.20    FEE ADMINISTRATION. 



   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are
not charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the
Company, reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by
the Company in collecting franchise fees that the Company deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.



110.21    FEE REFUNDS. 



   The Company shall not under any circumstances be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or
calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers,
the City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company
to provide such data or information.



110.22    OTHER FRANCHISE FEES. 



   At any time after the City enters into a franchise agreement with
another person to sell natural gas at retail to City consumers and a
franchise fee or its lawful equivalent is imposed at zero or at a lesser rate
than provided in this ordinance, either the City or the Company may provide
written notice to the other to amend the franchise agreement to address the
level of the franchise fees then imposed or scheduled to take effect during
the term of this franchise agreement.  The parties shall have a ninety (90)
day period after the date of the written notice to negotiate such an
amendment to the franchise agreement.  The parties may negotiate changes in
the levels of fees during this period, or, if they cannot agree upon such an
amendment, either party shall have the unilateral right to terminate the
franchise.



110.23    OBLIGATION TO COLLECT. 



   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this ordinance
is modified or repealed if legislation is enacted by the Iowa General
Assembly or if the Supreme Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding
franchise fees or if the Iowa Utilities Board issues a final nonappealable
order (collectively, “final franchise fee action”) that modifies, but
does not repeal, the ability of the City to impose a franchise fee or the
ability of the Company to collect from City customers and remit franchise
fees to City. Within sixty (60) days of final franchise fee action, the City
shall notify the Company and the parties shall meet to determine whether this
ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the franchise fee on a
continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements.  After final franchise
fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the franchise fee
ordinance, the Company may temporarily discontinue collection and remittance
of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is required to do
so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.  The other provisions
of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be
completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to the City the
franchise fee, effective as of the date specified below, with no liability
therefore, under each of any of the following circumstances as determined to
exist in the sole discretion of the Company:



      1.   The imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise
fee is ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the
date of such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.



      2.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making
imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective
as of the date lawfully specified by the General Assembly.



      3.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies
the Company the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee, provided
such denial is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the
date of the final agency order from which the appeal is taken.



110.24    MANAGEMENT FEES. 



   The City shall not, pursuant to Section 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa,
impose or charge Company right-of-way management fees for permits for Company
construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting or
inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.



110.25    TERMINATION. 



   Either the City or the Company (“party”) may terminate this
franchise if the other party shall be materially in breach of its
provisions.  Upon the occurrence of a material breach, the non-breaching
party shall provide the breaching party with notification by certified mail
specifying the alleged breach.  The breaching party shall have sixty (60)
days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-breaching party and the
parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for cure. If the breach is not
cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may terminate this
franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of this franchise
if it has operated in compliance with federal law, state law, and this
ordinance.  A party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise
if the alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the
other party.

such right so as to minimize the impact of any such taking.



   2.   The Company shall obtain City’s consent, which shall not be

   3.   In the event the City raises the rate of franchise fees above
zero percent (0%), the Company will commence collecting franchise fees on or
before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month following
ninety (90) days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the change to the franchise fee rate. This information shall include but not
be limited to a copy of the City’s Revenue Purpose Statement and written

as being subject to the franchise fee or being exempt from the imposition of
the franchise fee.

such ordinance increasing, decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise
fee shall become effective, billings reflecting the change shall commence on
an agreed upon date which is not less than ninety (90) days following written
notice to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall not be required to

Iowa law.



   9.   The City shall be solely responsible for the proper use of any
amounts collected as franchise fees, and shall only use such fees as
collected for a purpose as allowed by applicable law.



   10.   The Company shall not under any circumstances be required to
return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City
customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of
franchise fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying
customers or calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of customers or
individual customers, the City shall reimburse the Company for reasonable
expenses incurred by the Company to provide such data or information.



   11.   Collection of the franchise fee shall cease at the earlier of
the modification or repeal of the franchise fee or the end of the ordinance
term.



      A.   In the event the City contemplates (i) entering into a
franchise agreement with another person/entity to sell electricity at retail
to City consumers that imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at a
lesser rate than provided in this ordinance, or (ii) adding additional
territory wherein  a franchise fee would not be imposed upon all persons
selling electricity to consumers within the additional territory, then not
later than ninety (90) days prior to taking the action set forth in
subsection (i) or (ii), the City shall provide written notice to the
Company.  The Parties shall have a ninety (90) day period following receipt
of the written notice by Company to negotiate in good faith a mutually
acceptable amendment to the franchise fees imposed.  If the Parties cannot
agree on a mutually agreeable fee level, after negotiating in good faith for
ninety days, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this
franchise agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other
Party.



      B.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by
this ordinance shall be modified if the  Iowa General Assembly enacts
legislation, or any Iowa court issues a final judicial decision regarding
franchise fees, or the Iowa Utilities Board issues a final nonappealable
order (collectively, “Final Franchise Fee Action”) that modifies, but
does not repeal, the ability of the City to impose a franchise fee or the
ability of Company to collect from City customers and remit franchise fees to
City. Within sixty (60) days of Final Franchise Fee Action, the City shall
notify Company and the parties shall meet to determine whether this ordinance
can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the franchise fee on a continuing
basis to meet revised legal requirements. After Final Franchise Fee Action
and until passage by the City of revisions to the franchise fee ordinance,
Company may temporarily adjust or discontinue collection and remittance of
the franchise fee if it believes in good faith that it is required to do so
in order to comply with revised legal requirements.



      C.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by
this ordinance is repealed, effective as of the date specified below with no
liability therefor, if:



         (1)   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of
a franchise fee is ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa,
effective as of the date of such ruling or as may be specified by that Court;
or



         (2)   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation
making imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful,
effective as of the date lawfully specified by the General Assembly; or



         (3)   The Iowa Utilities Board, or any successor agency,
denies the Company the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee
provided such denial is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as
of the date of the final agency order from which the appeal is taken.



   12.   With the exception of the franchise fee imposed by this
ordinance, the Company shall not be required to make any payments or pay any
fees to the City in exchange for the Company’s provision of electrical
services to its customers in the City and for the Company’s use of streets,
alleys and public places in the said City and other administrative or
regulatory costs with regard to said franchise; and said poles, lines, wires,
conduits and other appliances for the distribution of electric current along,
under and upon the streets, alleys and public places in the said City to
supply individuals, corpora-tions, communities, and municipali-ties both
inside and outside of said City with electric light, heat and power shall be

   The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa,

cutting or inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.



111.12    TERM OF FRANCHISE. 



   The term of the franchise granted by this ordinance and the rights
granted thereunder shall continue for the period of twenty-five (25) years

the Anniversary Date of this franchise by notifying Company in writing of its
desire to do so, said notification to be given within thirty (30) days of the
tenth (10th) or twentieth (20th) anniversary respectively of this
franchise.  If Company is not notified of the cancellation by the tenth
(10th) or twentieth (20th) anniversary then this franchise shall continue
without cancellation until the twenty-fifth (25th) year.



111.13    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. 



   This ordinance sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between
the Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may
not be superseded, modified or otherwise amended without the written approval
and acceptance of the Company.  Upon written acceptance by the Company, this
ordinance shall supersede, abrogate and repeal the prior electric system
ordinance between the Company and the City as of the date this ordinance is
accepted by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the City enact any ordinance or place any limitations, either operationally
or through the assessment of fees other than those approved and accepted by

the provisions of Chapter 115 of this Code of Ordinances and this chapter. 
If the terms and conditions specified in this chapter conflict with Chapter
115, the provisions of Chapter 115 shall apply.

   1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to award a franchise
renewal for a cable television system to Galaxy Telecom, L.P.  Franchisee
will endeavor to provide top quality cable service.



   2.   Enactment.  Franchisee is hereby granted a nonexclusive
franchise to operate a cable television system within the City in accordance
with Chapter 115 of this Code of Ordinances, which establishes standards,
regulations, and procedures for the granting of a cable television franchise,

filed by the Franchisee with the City.



   4.   Use of Public Ways.  For the purpose of operating and
maintaining a cable television system in the City, Franchisee may erect in,
over, under, or upon, across, and along the public streets, alleys, and ways
within the City such wires, cables, fiber optics, conductors, ducts,
conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments,

alleys, or other public ways or public places.  The City specifically
reserves the right to grant at any time during the term of the franchise or
renewal thereof, if any, such additional franchises for a cable

to those contained herein, taking into account the size and population of the
franchised area, including (but not limited to) franchise fees, external
costs, access fees, if applicable, design, term, density requirements, and
system capacity requirements.  In the event that the City grants another

dwelling units in the area by the length (in miles or fractions thereof) of
the total length of aerial or underground cable necessary to make service
available to the residential dwelling units in such area in accordance with
Franchisee’s system design parameters.  The cable length shall be measured

   In order to develop and promote public educational, and government
access programming for the system’s access channels, Franchisee hereby
agrees to provide the following:



   1.   Access Channels.  Franchisee shall maintain the current number
and position of the access channel.  Within 120 days after the date of the
franchise renewal, Franchisee shall provide the City a second channel for PEG
access.  After the upgrade, the Franchisee shall use its best efforts to
maintain the cable channel position of the access channels in existence on
the effective date of the franchise.  After the upgrade and upon the request
of the City, whenever the access channels as set forth in this section show
documented proof of performance that they are in use 80% of the cablecast
week for any six-week consecutive timeframe, given at least 12 hours per day,
seven days per week cablecast schedule, with at least 80% (of the time the
channel is programmed) unduplicated locally originated programming, the
Franchisee shall make up to two additional access channels available as
necessary for access use within six months of receipt of request by the
City.  Programming consisting primarily of text messages shall not be
included in calculating PEG access use.  Such additional PEG access capacity
shall be dedicated for the type of access specified by the City.  All active
access channels shall be placed on the basic tier of service, unless both
parties mutually agree otherwise.



   2.   Local Programming Fee.  As soon as practicable after the date
of the franchise renewal, but in no event later than 120 days, the City and
the Franchisee shall provide for the assessment and collection of a $0.50 per
subscriber/per month local programming fee as follows:



      A.   Representatives of the City and the Franchisee shall
develop a joint notice to subscribers that describes the purpose of the fee
and the City’s plans for the proceeds from the fee.



      B.   The City and Franchisee shall also cooperate on other
means of explaining the fee to subscribers, including the use of newspaper
announcements and announcements on the cable system.



      C.   Within 45 days after the delivery of the joint notice to
subscribers, Franchisee shall adjust its monthly bills to include the $0.50
per subscriber fee.



      D.   On a quarterly basis thereafter, Franchisee shall pay to
the City the equivalent of $0.50 per subscriber per month, adjusted for
nonpayment.



      E.   The City shall use the proceeds of the fee to help
support PEG access programming.



      F.   Within 15 months after the initial assessment of the fee,
the City shall complete a review of the fee.  After the initial review, the
City may conduct similar reviews periodically at its discretion.  A review
shall include an opportunity for public comment on matters relating to the
fee.  After a review, if the City determines that collection of the fee is
no longer necessary or desirable for the support of PEG programming, the City
shall notify Franchisee that it will cease assessing the fee and that payment
of the fee to the City is no longer required.



      G.   Both parties agree that this fee shall not be deducted
from the cable franchise fee.



   3.   Optical Transmission Equipment.  The Franchisee agrees to
provide one digital, optical transmission package upon request of the City,
if the Franchisee converts the basic service tier to digital transmission
technology.  The Franchisee agrees to connect the optical equipment using
coaxial cable or fiber optics with the local origination site specified by
the City.



   4.   Signal Quality.  Franchisee shall assure that the access
channel delivery system from the City Hall and all other origination points
specified herein meet the same technical standards as the remainder of the
system as set forth in Section 114.08 of this chapter.



   5.   Treatment.  The Franchisee will confer with the City on the
content and format of any separate line item on the monthly bill related to
local programming.



   6.   Origination Sites.  The Franchisee shall maintain and/or

lines from the locations from which local programming can be originated on
the effective date of the franchise to the Franchisee’s headend.



   7.   Access Capital Grant and Access Channel.  Within 120 days

provide the City with an $11,000 up-front capital grant to be used for the
cost of the technical interconnection to the Government Channel 4 from Iowa
City, Iowa, which Galaxy shall perform at the City’s request.  This
Government Channel 4 shall be imported and broadcast on the North Liberty
Cable System on a basic service channel to be agreed upon with the City. 
All negotiations with Iowa City for permission for this technical
interconnection, for Government Channel 4 from Iowa City, and all related
programming costs shall be the responsibility of the City of North Liberty. 
In the event that the City is unsuccessful in its negotiations with Iowa City
and is therefore unable to obtain Government Channel 4, the $11,000 capital
grant may be used for PEG access equipment and/or access facilities, as the
City deems appropriate.



   8.   Access Publicity.  The Franchisee agrees to insert into
subscriber handbooks information about local access channels.  The cost of
printing, etc. of this information shall be the sole responsibility of the
access programming provider (government, education, public).  The Franchisee
reserves the right to approve content.  The Franchisee agrees to allow
billing messages or bill stuffers to be included in subscriber’s bills at
the rate of one per year subject to approval of content by the Franchisee,

insertion shall be the responsibility of the access programming providers
(government, education, public).



114.12  INTERCONNECTION.



   Franchisee’s system shall be designed to be interconnected with other
adjacent systems.  At a minimum, the system shall be capable of

subscribers’ service charges.

origin, age, sexual orientation, or marital status.  In the employment of
persons, Franchisee shall fully comply with applicable local, State and
Federal law, and shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are

renewed by the City in accordance with Chapter 115.



114.17  POLICE POWERS.



   In accepting the franchise, Franchisee acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police powers of the City to adopt and enforce
general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and it
agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by
the City pursuant to such power.



114.18  FRANCHISE FEE.



   Franchisee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of five percent of
gross annual revenues or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is
higher, during the period of its operation under the Franchise, pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 115.  Any increase in the franchise fee shall be
implemented as soon as practicable, but no longer than forty-five (45) days.



114.19  REGULATION.



   1.   The City shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority under
the provisions of Chapter 115 and this chapter.  Regulation may be exercised
through any duly designated City office or duly established Board or
Commission or other body of the City.



   2.   Franchisee, by accepting the rights hereby granted, agrees that
it will perform and keep all lawful acts and obligations imposed,
represented, or promised by the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 115, and
the renewal proposal.



114.20  REMEDIES.



   1.   Schedule of Liquidated Damages.  Because Franchisee’s
failure to comply with certain material provisions of this chapter and
Chapter 115 will result in injury to the City or to subscribers, and because
it will be difficult to estimate the extent of such injury, the City and
Franchisee hereby agree that the liquidated damages and penalties stated in
Chapter 115 represent both parties’ best estimate of the damages resulting
from the specified injury.



   2.   Violations.  For the violation of any of the following, the
City shall notify Franchisee in writing of the violation.  The City shall
provide Franchisee with a detailed written notice of any Franchise violation
upon which it proposes to take action, and there shall be a 30-day period
within which Franchisee may demonstrate that a violation does not exist or to
cure an alleged violation or, if the violation cannot be corrected in 30
days, submit a plan satisfactory to the City to correct the violation.  If
an alleged violation is proven to exist, following a duly noticed public
hearing, and no cure or action on a plan acceptable to the City has been
received by the City within 30 days, such liquidated damages shall be
chargeable to the Letter of Credit as set forth in Chapter 115 if not
tendered by Franchisee within 30 days.  Franchisee may petition the Council
for relief with just cause.  The imposition of liquidated damages shall not
preclude the City from exercising the other enforcement provisions of Chapter
115, including revocation, or other statutory or judicially imposed
penalties.  Liquidated damages may be imposed as follows:



      A.   For failure to complete construction or extend service in
accordance with franchise:  $100/day for each day the violation continues.



      B.   For failure to comply with requirements for public
educational and government access:  $100/day for each day the violation
continues.



      C.   For failure to submit reports, maintain records, provide
documents or information:  $100/day for each day the violation continues.



      D.   For violation of customer service standards required by
this chapter, Chapter 115, or by FCC regulation:  $100/day per standard
violated.



      E.   For violation of the books and financial records
provisions of this chapter and Chapter 115:  up to $100/day for each day the
violation continues.



      F.   For violation of other material provisions of this
chapter or Chapter 115:  up to $100/day for each day the violation continues.



114.21  COOPERATION.



   The parties recognize that it is within their mutual best interests for
the cable television system to be operated as efficiently as possible in
accordance with the requirements set forth in this agreement. To achieve
this, parties agree to cooperate with each other in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this franchise. Should either party believe that the other
is not acting timely or reasonably within the confines of applicable
regulations and procedures in responding to a request for action, that party
shall notify the person or agents specified herein. The person or agent thus
notified will use its best effort to facilitate the particular action
requested.



114.22  WAIVER.



   The failure of the City at any time to require performance by
Franchisee of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the right of the
City hereafter to enforce the same. Nor shall the waiver by the City of any
breach of any provision hereof be taken to be a waiver of any succeeding
breach of such provision, or as a waiver of the provision itself.



114.23  CUMULATIVE PROVISION.



   The rights and remedies reserved to the City by this franchise are
cumulative and shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other
rights or remedies which the City may have with respect to the subject matter
of this franchise, and a waiver thereof at any time shall have no effect on
the enforcement of such rights or remedies at a future time.



114.24  NO LIABILITY.



   Nothing herein shall be deemed to create civil liability by one party
for action, omissions or negligence of the other party, or of a party's
agents, employees, officers or assigns. Each party shall be solely liable for
claims against it by third parties, whether arising under the Cable Act or
under any other provision of law.

Such captions shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the agreement.



114.27  NO JOINT VENTURE.



   Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a joint venture or
principal-agent relationship between the parties, and neither party is
authorized to, nor shall either party act toward third persons or the public,
in any manner which would indicate any such relationship with the other.

   The City finds that the development of cable communications systems has
the potential of great benefit and impact upon the residents of the City. 
Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable
television, the City finds that the public health, safety, and general
welfare can best be served by establishing certain regulatory powers in the
City, as this chapter shall designate.  It is the intent of this chapter to
provide for the means to attain the best possible communication and
developmental results in the public interest and for such public purpose. 
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include
these findings as an integral part thereof.

which they are offering securities to the public) of 20 percent or more of a
North Liberty cable system or the franchise under which the system is
operated.  A change in the control or controlling interest of an entity

the City on a grantee solely because of its status as a grantee.  The term
“franchise fee” does not include:



      A.   Any tax, fee, or assessment of general applicability

shall not deduct the following:  (i) any operating expense; (ii) any
accrual, including without limitation any accrual for commissions; or (iii)
any other expenditures, regardless of whether such expense, accrual, or
expenditure reflects a cash payment, but revenue shall be counted only once
in determining gross revenues.  Gross revenues also include the revenue of
any affiliate, subsidiary, parent, or any person or entity in which each
grantee has a financial interest, derived from the operation of the cable
television system to provide cable services, to the extent such revenue is
derived through any means that has the effect of avoiding the payment of
franchisee fees that would otherwise be paid to the City.  Revenues of both
grantee and an affiliate, subsidiary, parent, or any person or entity in
which the grantee has a financial interest that represent a transfer of funds
between them and that would constitute gross revenues of both the grantee and
the affiliate, subsidiary, parent, or any person or entity in which the
grantee has a financial interest shall be counted only once for purposes of
determining gross revenues.  Gross revenues shall not include franchise
fees, any other fee, assessment, sales, or other similar tax imposed by law
on subscribers or that grantee is legally obligated to collect.

customers.  In all cases, normal business hours must include some evening
hours at least one night per week and/or some weekend hours.

seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of the cable system.

renew a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, maintain,

under this chapter shall be consistent with Federal laws and regulations and

State law shall control.



   8.   Chapter Revisions.  Any franchise granted under this chapter
is made subject to any revisions of this chapter and the general ordinances
of the City, provided that such revisions do not materially alter or impair
the obligations of grantee set forth in any franchise agreement.



   9.   Term.  A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall
become effective in accordance with the franchise agreement.  The term shall
be stated in the franchise, but shall in no event exceed fifteen years.



   10.   Other Licenses or Permits.  A franchise granted under this
chapter shall not take the place of any other license or permit legally
required of a grantee.



115.07  FRANCHISE ACCEPTANCE.



   To accept a franchise granted under this chapter, a grantee must file
any required bonds, funds, and proof of insurance, as well as written notice
of acceptance with the City Clerk within 60 days of the effective date of the
franchise agreement.  Such written notice shall include a certification that
the grantee:



   1.   Will comply with this chapter, any franchise agreements made
pursuant to this chapter, and all applicable City, County, State and Federal
regulations in regard to the construction, operation, and maintenance of a
cable system;



   2.   Accepts the franchise relying on its own investigation and
understanding of the power and authority of the City to grant the franchise
and the terms and conditions thereof;



   3.   Acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into the
franchise by any understanding or promise or by other statement, whether
written or verbal, by or on behalf of the City or by any other third person
concerning any term or condition of the franchise or chapter not expressed
herein;



   4.   Shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City for any
loss, cost, expense or damage by reason of the City’s failure to have
authority to grant any or all parts of the franchise, and will not at any
time claim in any proceeding involving the City that any agreed upon term or
condition of this chapter or the franchise is unreasonable or arbitrary, or
that the City had no power or authority to grant or make any such term or
condition.  The grantee shall accept the validity of the terms and
conditions of this chapter or the franchise in their entirety, except where
such term or condition is irreconcilable with any Federal or State law or FCC
rules and regulations.



   5.   Agrees that, in the event of any conflict between the chapter
and the franchise agreement, the terms of the chapter shall prevail.



   A grantee of a franchise granted or transferred under this chapter will
pay for the actual printing cost and publication cost incurred in granting
the franchise, not to exceed $5,000.00.



115.08  TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



   1.   Transfer of Franchise.  Any franchise granted under this
chapter shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public.  Any
franchise so granted cannot, in any event, be sold, transferred, leased,
assigned, or disposed of, including (but not limited to) by forced or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, or other means, without the prior
written consent of the City, and then only under such reasonable conditions
as the City may establish, subject to Section 537 of the Cable Act and
applicable FCC regulations.  Such consent, as required by the City, shall be
given or denied no later than 120 days following any request, and shall not
be unreasonably withheld.  If the City fails to render a final decision on
the request within 120 days of receiving a transfer request, such request
shall be deemed approved unless the requesting party and the City agree to an
extension of time.  Prior consent shall be required when transferring the
franchise between wholly owned subsidiaries of the same entity.



   2.   Ownership or Control.  The grantee shall promptly notify in
writing the City of any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by
any other party of, control of the grantee.  A rebuttable presumption that a
transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer
by any person or group of persons consisting of 20 percent or more of the
beneficial ownership interest of the grantee.  Every change, transfer, or
acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to
cancellation unless and until the City shall have consented in writing
thereto, which consent shall be given or denied no later than 120 days
following any request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld.  If the City
fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days of receiving
a transfer request, such request shall be deemed approved unless the
requesting party and the City agree to an extension of time.  For the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or
acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the qualifications of the
prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the City in any
such inquiry.  In seeking the grantee’s consent to any change in ownership
or control, the grantee shall have the responsibility:



      A.   To show to the satisfaction of the City whether the
proposed purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the “proposed transferee”),
which in the case of a corporation, shall include all directors and all
persons having a legal or equitable interest of five percent or more of the
voting stock:



         (1)   Within ten years before the transfer request, has
been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral turpitude, including
(but not limited to) any violation of Federal, State or local law or
regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation, or complaint
charging such acts;



         (2)   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud,
deceit or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any
court of competent jurisdiction; or



         (3)   Previous or pending legal claim, lawsuit, or
administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system or
operation of cable system.



      B.   To establish, to the satisfaction of the City, the
financial solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting all current
financial data for the proposed transferee which the grantee was required to
submit in its franchise application, and such other data as the City may
request, where the same shall be audited, certified, and qualified by a
certified public accountant.



      C.   To establish to the satisfaction of the City that the
financial and technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as
shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining
term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms.



   3.   Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or
its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation
of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that the financial
institution, or its designee, intend to take control and operate the cable
system in the event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. 
Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such
operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all
franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system.  The financial institution shall not exercise
control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by
the City in its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the
right to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another grantee. 
Except insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar
laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and further subject to
applicable Federal, State or local law, if the City finds that such transfer,
after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public
interest qualities of the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the City
shall transfer and assign the right and obligations of such franchise as in
the public interest.  The consent of the City to such transfer shall be
given or denied no less than 120 days after any request, and shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  In cases of either a transfer of the franchise or a
proposed change in ownership or control of the grantee involving a wholly
owned subsidiary of grantee, upon written request of the grantee, the City
may waive or modify the requirements of this section.  The City shall
provide grantee notice of its decision on such request as soon as practicable
after receipt.  Notwithstanding grantee’s request under this section, the
120-day period for rendering a decision on a transfer of the franchise or a
change in ownership or control shall commence upon the City’s receipt of
grantee’s notice of proposed transfer or change in ownership or control.



   4.   The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by the
grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in
and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise.



   5.   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the City shall
not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion
of initial construction of the cable system.



   6.   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the
franchise agreement.



   7.   The City may approve the transfer, deny the transfer with
cause, or conditionally approve the transfer, provided that the City shall
not unreasonably refuse to approve the transfer or condition the transfer
upon unreasonable conditions.  The conditions the City may attach to the
transfer approval may include, but are not limited to:  charges that are
incidental to the awarding of the franchise, as allowed under Federal law;
remedy of any existing or historical violations of City ordinances or the
franchise agreement, provided that for violations occurring before the date
of the transfer request, City has given notice of such violations to the
grantee before City has received the transfer request; payment of all fees
and penalties owed by the grantee at the time of transfer approval; and a
guarantee by the proposed transferee to abide by any and all ordinances,
agreements, and conditions placed upon the franchise and system by the City
and existing grantee, unless mutually removed by the City and grantee.



   8.   When the grantee approves a transfer under this section, the
new grantee shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in
Section 115.07, including the filing of all necessary bonds, funds, proofs of
insurance, and certifications.



115.09  FRANCHISE RENEWAL.



   1.   The City may decide to renew a franchise granted under this
chapter if the grantee files a written request for such a renewal.  At the
time of such request, the City may update this chapter and reevaluate the
needs of the community for cable service and the performance of the grantee.



   2.   The applicable Federal law shall govern the procedures and
standards for renewal of any franchise awarded pursuant to this chapter.



   3.   To the extent that the Federal law is not applicable, the City
in its sole discretion and judgment shall have the right to grant, deny, or
conditionally grant renewal of a franchise, provided that the City shall not
unreasonably refuse to renew the franchise or unreasonably condition the
renewal.  The conditions the City may place on its approval include, but are
not limited to:  charges that are incidental to the awarding of the
franchise renewal as allowed under Federal law; updating this chapter and
surveying community cable needs; remedy of historical or existing violations
of the franchise or this chapter, provided that for violations occurring
before the date of the transfer request, City has given notice of such
violations to the grantee before City has received the renewal request;
payment of all fees and penalties owed by the grantee at the time of the
renewal; acceptance of any updated ordinance; and acceptance of any updated
franchise agreement.



   4.   When the City approves a franchise renewal, the grantee shall
accept the renewed franchise under the procedures set out in Section 115.07.



   5.   At the expiration (and denial of renewal) of a franchise, the
City may, in a lawful manner and upon payment of fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system is valued as a going concern
exclusive of any value attributable to the franchise itself, obtain,
purchase, acquire, take over, and hold the cable system.



115.10  FRANCHISE FEE.



   1.   Quarterly Franchise Payment.  Grantee shall pay the City a fee
of five percent of grantee’s annual gross revenue or such other maximum
amount as allowed by applicable law.  Such payment shall commence as of the
effective date of the franchise or any renewal date.  The City shall be
furnished, on an annual basis, a statement within 120 days of the close of
the calendar year, either audited and certified by an independent certified
public accountant or certified by a financial officer of the grantee,
reflecting the total amount of the revenue and all payments, deductions and
computations for the period covered by the payment.  Upon ten days’ prior
written notice, City shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of
grantee’s records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
procedures, and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five
percent or more, the grantee shall pay the actual costs of such an audit.



   2.   Acceptance by City.  No acceptance of any payment by the City
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee
under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligations of the
grantee.



   3.   Failure to Make Required Payment.  In the event that any
payment is not made as required, interest on the amount due, as determined
from the annual gross revenues as computed by the City or its designee, shall
accrue from the date of the required submittal at an annual rate of 12
percent.



   4.   Payment Schedule.  The franchise fee shall be paid on a
quarterly basis according to the following schedule:  March shall be
reflected in an April 30 payment; revenues for April through June shall be
reflected in a July 30 payment; revenues for July through September in an
October 30 payment; and revenues for October through December in a January 31
payment.



   All cable revenues to the City shall be placed in the City’s General
Fund, and allocated to the telecommunication department and/or
telecommunications commission at the City’s discretion.



115.11  REVOCATION.



   1.   Grounds for Revocation.  If the grantee has been given due
notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, the City reserves the right to
revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which
shall represent a default under this chapter and a material breach of the
franchise:



      A.   If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of
its material obligations under this chapter or under such documents,
agreements, and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the
City and the grantee, subject to the provisions on cure.



      B.   If the grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full
force and effect, the liability and indemnification coverage or the security
fund or bonds as required herein.



      C.   If any court of competent jurisdiction, or any Federal or
State regulatory body by rules, decisions, or other action, determines that
any material provision of the franchise documents, including this chapter,
the franchise agreement and grantee’s proposal is invalid or unenforceable
prior to the commencement of initial system construction.



      D.   If the grantee ceases to provide service for a period
exceeding 30 days for any reason within the control of the grantee over the
cable system, or abandons the management and/or operation of the system.



      E.   If the grantee willfully violates any of the material
provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement or attempts to practice
any fraud or deceit upon the City.



      F.   If the grantee becomes insolvent, or upon listing of an
order for relief in favor of grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding.



      G.   If the grantee transfers a controlling interest of the
franchise without the prior approval or consent of the City as required in
Section 115.08.



   2.   Procedure Prior to Revocation.



      A.   The City shall make a written demand that the grantee
comply with any requirements, limitations, terms, conditions, rules, or
regulations or correct any action deemed cause for revocation.  Such written
demand shall detail the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance and shall
provide the grantee with 30 days in which to correct the alleged
noncompliance.  In the event the stated violation is not corrected to the
City’s satisfaction within said 30 days, the City shall schedule a public
hearing and notify the grantee in writing of said public hearing.



      B.   At the scheduled public hearing, the City shall hear any
persons interested therein and shall provide the grantee with an opportunity
to provide testimony and evidence.  The City, following the public hearing,
shall issue a written decision no sooner than 30 days following the
hearing.  The City shall determine, based upon the preponderance of the
evidence, whether the grantee committed a material breach of this chapter or
the franchise agreement and, if so, whether such breach was willful and
whether said franchise shall be revoked.



      C.   If the City determines that the grantee has willfully
committed a material breach, then the City may, by resolution, declare the
franchise terminated and that the grantee’s security fund and bonds be
forfeited.  Alternatively, the City may, at its option, direct the grantee
to take appropriate remedial action within such time and under such terms and
conditions as the City may prescribe in order to avoid termination of the
franchise.



      D.   Upon revocation of the franchise, the City may, in a
lawful manner and upon payment of fair market value, determined on the basis
of the cable system as a going concern exclusive of any value attributable to
the franchise itself, obtain, purchase, acquire, take over and hold the cable
system.



115.12  PROCEDURES ON TERMINATION.



   1.   Disposition of Facilities.  Subject to Federal, State and
local laws, in the event a franchise expires, is revoked, or otherwise
terminated, the City may order the removal of the above-ground system
facilities from the franchise area within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the City or require the original grantee to maintain and
operate its cable system for a period not to exceed 24 months as indicated in
subsection 4 of this section.



   2.   Restoration of Property.  In removing its plant, structures,
and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation
that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as
good condition as that prevailing prior to the grantee’s removal of its
plant, structures, and equipment without affecting the electrical or
telephone cable wires, or attachments.  The grantee’s insurance, indemnity
obligations, performance bonds and security funds required by this chapter
and by the franchise agreement shall continue in full force and effect during
the period of removal and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms
and conditions of this section.



   3.   Restoration by City; Reimbursement of Costs.  In the event of
a failure by the grantee to complete any work required by subsection 1 of
this section and/or subsection 2 of this section, or any other work required
by City by law or ordinance, within 30 days after receipt of written notice,
and to the satisfaction of the City, the City may cause such work to be done
and the grantee shall reimburse the City the cost thereof within 30 days
after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the City may recover such
costs through the security fund or bonds provided by grantee.  The City
shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.



   4.   Extended Operation.  Subject to Federal, State and local law,
upon either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, the City may require
the grantee to continue to operate the cable system for a defined period of
time not to exceed 24 months from the date of such expiration or
revocation.  The grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in interest,
continue to operate the cable communications system under the terms and
conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and to provide the
regular cable service and any of the other services that may be provided at
that time.



   5.   City’s Rights Not Affected.  The termination and forfeiture
of any franchise shall in no way affect any of the rights of the City under
any provision of law.



115.13  RECEIVERSHIP, CONDEMNATION, AND FORECLOSURE. 



   1.   Operation by Receiver.  Any franchise granted shall, at the
option of the City, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a
receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees designated to take over and
conduct the business of the grantee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, condemnation, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding
unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:



      A.   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days
after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the
receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all defaults
under the franchise; and



      B.   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days,
execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by
each and every term, provision, and limitation of the franchise agreement.



   2.   Involuntary Sale.  In the case of a foreclosure or other
involuntary sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee, or any
part thereof, the City may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and
to the purchaser at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights and
privileges of the grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after
service of such notice, unless:



      A.   The City shall have approved the transfer of the
franchise, as and in the manner in this chapter provided; and



      B.   Such successful purchaser shall have covenanted and
agreed with the City to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions
of the franchise agreement.



115.14  FRANCHISE PROCESSING COSTS.

and upon any services rendered by the grantee.



   5.   Other Costs.  The processing costs provided for in this
section shall be in addition to any other inspection or permit fee or other
fees due to City under any other ordinance.



115.15  AUTHORITY FOR USE OF STREETS.



   1.   Use of Streets.  For the purposes of operating and maintaining
a system in the City, grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace,
reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, across, and along the streets
within the City, lines, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults,
manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments, and other property
and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the
system, provided that all applicable permits are applied for and granted, all
fees paid, and all other City codes and ordinances otherwise complied with. 
However, no rights hereunder may be transferred by grantee to any other
entity except grantee’s construction agents.



   2.   Filing Plans.  Prior to construction or alteration, grantee
shall in each case file plans with all appropriate City departments and
receive written approval of such plans, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  Grantee shall provide in writing a monthly progress
report to City through the completion of construction or alteration.



   3.   Noninterference.  Grantee shall construct and maintain the
system so as not to interfere with other uses of streets.  Grantee shall
make use of existing poles and other facilities available to grantee whenever
practicable.  Grantee shall notify all residents directly affected by
proposed construction prior to the commencement of that work.



   4.   Denial of Use by City.  Notwithstanding the above grant to use
the streets, no street shall be used by grantee if City in its sole opinion,
determines that such use is inconsistent with the conditions or provisions by
which such street was created or dedicated, or presently used.



115.16  CONDITIONS ON USE OF STREETS.



   1.   Limit Interference.  All transmission and distribution,
structures, lines, and equipment erected by grantee within the City shall be
so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets
and other public places and the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners who adjoin such streets and other public places.



   2.   Restoration of Streets.  In case of disturbance of any street
or public place, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a
manner approved by the City Engineer, replace and restore such area in as
good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done.



   3.   Tree Trimming.  The grantee shall comply with the provisions
of Chapter 150 of this Code of Ordinances.  Each grantee shall be
responsible for, shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City and its
officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all damages arising
out of or resulting from the removal, trimming, mutilation of, or injury to
any tree or trees proximately caused by the grantee or its officers, agents,
employees, contractors, or subcontractors.



115.17  ERECTION OF POLES.



   1.   Consent to Erection of Poles.  No franchise shall be deemed to
expressly or implicitly authorize the grantee to construct or install poles
or wire-holding structures within streets for the purpose of placing cables,
wires, lines, or otherwise without the written consent of the City.  Such
consent shall be given upon such terms and conditions as the City Engineer
may prescribe, which shall include a requirement that the grantee perform, at
its sole expense, all tree trimmings required to maintain the poles clear of
obstructions.



   2.   The grantee may lease, rent, or in any other manner by mutual
agreement obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables, and other equipment
and facilities from utility companies operating within the City, and use
towers, poles, lines, cables, and other equipment and facilities for the
system.  When and where practicable, the poles used by the grantee’s
distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by such utility
companies operating within the City, provided mutually satisfactory rental
agreements can be reached.  It is the City’s desire that all holders of
public franchises in the City cooperate with the grantee and allow the
grantee the use of their poles and pole line facilities whenever possible so
that the number of new or additional poles installed in the City may be
minimized.



   3.   Access to Poles.  With respect to any poles or wire holding
structures which a grantee is authorized to construct and install within
streets, a public utility serving the City may, if denied the privilege of
utilizing such poles or wire-holding structures by the grantee, apply for
such permission to the Public Works Director.  If the Public Works Director
finds that such use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly
interfere with the grantee’s operations, the Public Works Director may
authorize such use subject to such terms and conditions as the Public Works
Director deems appropriate.  Such authorization shall include the condition
that the public utility pay to the grantee any and all actual and necessary
costs incurred by the grantee in permitting such use.  Nothing herein shall
be construed as a right for the grantee to utilize public utility property.



115.18  UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION.



   1.   Underground Installation Required.  Except as hereinafter
provided, in all areas of the City where the cables, wires, and other like
facilities of a public utility are placed underground, each grantee shall
construct and install its cables, wires, and other facilities underground at
time of construction unless it is impossible or impractical to do so due to
weather or other conditions beyond the control of the grantee, upon written
request from the City.  Such cable wire could remain above ground.  The
grantee must install the wire as soon as conditions permit and no later than
six months after original installation.  Amplifier boxes and pedestal
mounted terminal boxes may be placed aboveground if existing technology
reasonably requires, but shall be of such size and design and shall be so
located as not to be unsightly or unsafe.  In any area of the City where
there are certain cables, wires, and other like facilities of a public
utility underground and at least one operable cable, wire, or like facility
of a public utility is suspended above the ground from poles, a grantee may
construct and install its cables, wires, and other facilities from the same
pole with permission of the utility company which owns the poles.



   2.   Relocation Underground.  With respect to any cables, wires,
and other like facilities constructed and installed by a grantee above
ground, the grantee shall, at its sole expense, reconstruct and reinstall
such cables, wires, or other facilities underground pursuant to any project
under which the cables, wires, or other like facilities of all like utilities
are placed underground within an area.



115.19  RELOCATION.



   If, during the term of a franchise, the City, a public utility, a
sanitary district or any other similar special district elects to alter,
repair, realign, abandon, improve, vacate, reroute, or change the grade of
any street or to replace, repair, install, maintain, or otherwise alter any
aboveground or underground cable, wire, conduit, pipe, line pole,
wire-holding structure, or other facility utilized for the provisions of
utility or other services or transportation or drainage, sewage or other
liquids, the grantee shall, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, at its
sole expense, remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables,
underground conduits, manholes and any other facilities which it has
installed.  If such removal or relocation is required within the subdivision
in which all utility lines, including those for the system, were installed at
the same time, the entities may decide among themselves who is to bear the
cost of relocating; provided, the City shall not be liable to a grantee for
such costs.  Reasonable advance written notice shall be mailed to the
grantee advising the grantee of the date or dates that the removal or
relocation is to be undertaken. 



115.20  PLACEMENT OF BUILDINGS.



   Each grantee shall, upon request by any person holding a building
moving permit or other approval issued by the City, temporarily remove,
raise, or lower its wires to permit the movement of buildings.  The expense
of such removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the persons requesting
same, unless if requested by the City, in which case there shall be no
reimbursement to grantee.  Grantee shall be authorized to require such
payment in advance.  A grantee shall be given not less than 30 days’
written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.



115.21  SYSTEM DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.



   1.   System Design.  A cable system shall comply with the terms
specified in the franchise agreement.  Service shall be provided to
subscribers in accordance with the schedules and line extension policies
specified in Section 115.04 of this chapter.  Cable system construction and
provision of service shall be nondiscriminatory and grantee shall not delay
or deter service to any section of the franchise area on the grounds of
economic preference.



   2.   System Construction Schedule.



      A.   Grantee shall comply with the requirements of the system
construction or upgrade schedule contained in the franchise agreement.

information on a monthly basis, by submitting a copy of its normal internal
progress reports, showing specifically whether schedules are being met and
the reason for any delays.



   3.   All Channels Emergency Alert.  The grantee shall, in the case
of any emergency or disaster, make its entire system available without charge
to the City or to any other governmental or civil defense agency that the
City shall designate.  The system shall be engineered to comply with the
emergency alert system requirements of federal law and FCC regulations and
the franchise agreement.  The franchising authority shall hold the grantee,
its agents, employees, officers, and assigns hereunder, harmless from any
claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by the City,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.



   4.   Power Outage.  As specified in the franchise, the grantee will
install a back-up generator at its head end that will provide the needed
power to generate the head end in the event of a power outage.



   5.   Subscribers Control.



      A.   Switching Device.  The grantee, upon request from any
subscriber, shall install, at cost, a switching device to permit a subscriber
to continue to utilize the subscriber’s television antenna.  The grantee
shall not require the removal (or offer to remove) any subscriber’s antenna
lead-in wire.



      B.   Parental Control Devices.  Grantee shall provide to
subscribers, upon request, parental control devices that allow any channel or
channels to be locked out.  Such devices shall block both the video and
audio portion of such channels to the extent that both are unintelligible. 
The lockout device described herein shall be made available to all
subscribers requesting it, beginning on the first day that any cable service
is provided.



   6.   Interconnection.  The cable system shall be designed to be
interconnected with other adjacent systems.  At a minimum, the system shall
be capable of interconnection with the access channel programming to other
adjacent systems.



115.22  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.



   1.   Each grantee shall construct, install, and maintain its system
in a manner consistent and in compliance with all applicable laws,
ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, and technical
standards equivalent to those established by the FCC.  Each grantee shall
provide to the City written reports of the grantee’s annual proof of
performance tests conducted pursuant to FCC standards and requirements.



   2.   Each grantee shall at all times comply with the National
Electrical Safety Code (established by the National Bureau of Standards);
National Electrical Code; National Bureau of Fire Underwriters; applicable
FCC and other Federal, State, and local regulations; and codes and other
ordinances of the City.



   3.   In any event, the system shall not endanger or interfere with
the safety of persons or property within the City or other areas where the
grantee may have equipment located.



   4.   All working facilities, conditions, and procedures used or
occurring during construction and maintenance of the system shall comply with
the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.



   5.   Construction, installation, and maintenance of the system shall
be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner and in close coordination

within 60 days after the effective date of the franchise agreement, a
detailed test plan describing the methods and schedules for testing the cable
system on an ongoing basis to determine compliance with the provisions of the
franchise agreement.  The tests for basic cable service shall be performed
at intervals no greater than 12 months.  The tests may be witnessed by
representatives of the City, and comprehensive written test reports shall be
submitted to the City.  If any of the locations tested fail to meet the
performance standards, the grantee shall be required to indicate what
corrective measures have been taken, and the entire test shall be repeated. 
A second failure of the location tested may be considered breach of the
franchise agreement.



   3.   Special Tests.  At any time after commencement of service to
subscribers, the City may require additional tests, full or partial repeat
tests, different test procedures, or tests involving a specific
subscriber’s terminal.  Requests for such additional tests will be made on
the basis of complaints received or other evidence indicating an unresolved
controversy or significant noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to
the particular matter in controversy.  The City shall endeavor to so arrange
its requests for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or
inconvenience to grantee or to the subscriber.



   4.   Costs of Tests.  The costs of all tests required by
subsections 2 and 3 of this section, and re-testing as necessary, shall be

(i) the City and the grantee from agreeing to exceed the customer service
standards set forth herein; (ii) the establishment or enforcement of any
State or municipal law or regulation concerning customer service or consumer

standard shall be met no less than 95 percent of the time, measured on a
quarterly basis.



   9.   Notification of Service Interruption to City Administrator. 
The grantee shall promptly notify the City Administrator, in writing, or if
appropriate, by oral communication, of any significant interruption in the
operation of the system.  For the purposes of this section, a “significant
interruption in the operation of the system” means any interruption of
sound or picture on one or more channels of a duration of at least 18 hours
to at least five percent of the subscribers.



   10.   Customer Satisfaction Surveys.  The Telecommunications
Commission may periodically develop and distribute customer satisfaction and

prepared and conducted in good faith so as to provide reasonably reliable
measures of subscriber satisfaction with:  (i) audio and signal quality;
(ii) responses to subscriber complaints; (iii) billing practices; (iv)
programming services; and (v) installation practices.



   11.   FCC Rules.  The grantee shall conform with FCC Rules.

   2.   Breach for Noncompliance.  A repeated and verifiable pattern
of noncompliance with the consumer protection standards contained in this
chapter or franchise agreement, after grantee’s receipt of due notice and
an opportunity to cure, may be termed a breach of franchise, subject to any
and all remedies prescribed in this chapter, the Cable Act and applicable
law.  The grantee shall not be required to acquire equipment or perform
surveys to measure compliance with the telephone answering standards
contained in this chapter or franchise agreement, unless a historical record
of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply.



115.27  COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.



   1.   Complaints to Grantee.  Grantee shall establish written
procedures for receiving, acting upon, and resolving subscriber complaints
without intervention by the City.  The procedures shall prescribe the manner
in which a subscriber may submit a complaint, either orally or in writing. 
Grantee shall complete its investigation of a subscriber’s complaint within
ten days after receiving the complaint, and grantee shall notify the
subscriber of the results of the investigation and its proposed action or
resolution, if any, within two business days.  The grantee shall also notify
the subscriber of the subscriber’s right to file a complaint with the City
in the event the subscriber is dissatisfied with the grantee’s decision.



   2.   Complaints to City.  A subscriber who is dissatisfied with
grantee’s proposed decision shall be entitled to have the complaint
reviewed by the City.  The subscriber shall initiate the review by filing a
written complaint, together with the grantee’s decision, if any, with the
City, and by the City notifying the grantee of the filing.  The subscriber
shall make such filing and notification within 20 days of receipt of
grantee’s decision or, if no grantee decision has been provided, within 30
days after filing the original complaint with grantee.  The City may extend
these time limits for reasonable cause.



   3.   Review by the City.  The City shall determine, upon a review
of a subscriber complaint and the grantee’s decision, if any, whether
further action is warranted.  In the event the City does not initiate
further proceedings within 60 days of the filing of the complaint, the
grantee’s proposed action or resolution shall be final.  If the City
decides to initiate further investigation, the City shall require the grantee
and the subscriber to submit, within 15 days of notice thereof, a statement
of the facts and arguments in support of their respective positions.  The
City shall issue a written decision within 15 days of receipt of the
statements or, if a hearing is requested, within 30 days of the conclusion of
the hearing, setting forth the basis of the decision.



   4.   Remedies for Violation.  The City may, as a part of a
subscriber complaint decision issued under the provisions of this chapter,
impose civil penalties on the grantee, following written notice and 30 days
to cure, following receipt of said notice.  Upon grantee’s request, before
imposition of such penalties, City shall schedule a public hearing at which
grantee may present testimony and evidence and examine witnesses and the
complainant.



115.28  SUBSCRIBER NOTICE.



   1.   Operating Policies.  As subscribers are connected or
reconnected to the cable system, and at least annually, and at any time upon
request, and when grantee’s procedures change, under normal operating
conditions, the grantee shall provide each subscriber with written
information concerning products and services offered, prices and options for
programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other
services, installation and service maintenance policies, instructions on how
to use the cable services, channel positions of programming carried on the
system, the procedures for billing and making inquiries or complaints
(including the name, address, and local telephone number of the employee or
employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed)
and also furnish information concerning the City office responsible for
administration of the franchise including the name and telephone number of
the office.  The notice shall also indicate grantee’s business hours,
legal holidays, and procedures for responding to inquiries after normal
business hours.  The grantee shall provide all subscribers and the City
written notice no less than 30 days prior to any proposed change in these
policies.



   2.   A grantee, under normal operation conditions, shall provide all
subscribers and the City with notice of any change in rates, programming
services, or channel positions at least 30 days prior to the changes using

required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a
regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge
imposed by a Federal agency, State, or City on the transaction between the
grantee and subscribers.



   3.   Billing.  Bills shall be clear, concise, and understandable
and shall include the grantee’s toll-free or collect telephone number. 
Bills shall be fully itemized, with itemizations, including (but not limited
to) basic and premium service charges and equipment charges.  Bills shall
also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including
optional charges, rebates, and credits.  In case of a billing dispute, the
grantee shall respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within 30
days.  Refund checks will be issued promptly, and no later than either (i)
the customer’s next billing cycle following resolution of the request or 30
days, whichever is earlier, or (ii) the return of the equipment supplied by
the grantee if service is terminated.  Credits for service shall be issued
no later than the customer’s next billing cycle following the determination
that a credit is warranted.



   4.   Copies to City.  Copies of all notices provided to subscribers
shall be filed concurrently with the City.



115.29  QUALITY OF SERVICE.



   The overall quality of service provided by grantee to subscribers may
be subject to evaluation by City, not less often than once annually.  In
addition, City may evaluate the quality of service at any time, based upon
the number of subscriber complaints received by the grantee and the City, and
grantee’s response to those complaints.  City’s evaluation that service
quality is inadequate may lead to direction of grantee to cure the
inadequacies.  Grantee shall commence corrective action within 30 days after
receipt of written notice.  Failure to do so shall be deemed a breach of the
franchise and subject to the remedies prescribed in this chapter.  The City,
after due process, may utilize the performance bond and/or security fund
provided for in this chapter to remedy any such franchise breach.



115.30  TENANT’S RIGHTS.



   Grantee shall be required to provide service to tenants in individual
units of a multiple housing facility with all services offered to other
dwelling units within the franchise area, so long as the owner of the
facility consents in writing, if requested by grantee, to the following:



   1.   Grantee’s providing the service to units of the facility;



   2.   Reasonable conditions and time for installation, maintenance,
and inspection of the system on the facility premises;



   3.   Reasonable conditions promulgated by grantee to protect
grantee’s equipment and to encourage widespread use of the system; and



   4.   No discrimination in rental charges, or otherwise, between
tenants who receive cable service and those who do not.



115.31  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.



   1.   Discrimination Prohibited.  Grantee shall not deny service,
access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, PEG access channel
users, or general citizens on the basis of income, race, color, religion,
national origin, age, gender, marital status or physical or mental
disability.  Grantee shall comply at all times with the Cable Act and all
other applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and all
executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are
incorporated and made part of this chapter by reference.



   2.   Equal Employment.  Grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal
employment opportunity requirements of Federal, State and local law and
regulations in effect on the date of the franchise grant, and as amended from
time to time.



   3.   Personal Information.  The grantee’s policy with regard to
personally identifiable information shall be consistent with Federal law.



   4.   Equal Accessibility.  The entire system of the grantee shall
be operated in a manner consistent with the principle of fairness and equal
accessibility of its facilities, equipment, channels, studios, and other
services to all citizens, businesses, public agencies, and other entities
having a legitimate use for the system, and no one shall be arbitrarily
excluded from its use.



   5.   Discontinuation of Service.



      A.   If a subscriber fails to pay any proper fee or charge for
any service, the grantee may discontinue said service, provided that the
subscriber has been given no less than 15 days’ prior notice of the
intention to discontinue service.



      B.   If the grantee receives payment of all outstanding fees
and charges, including any late charges, prior to the expiration of the 15th
day after transmittal of said notice from the grantee, then the grantee shall
not discontinue said service.



      C.   After any service has been discontinued, upon request of
the subscriber accompanied by payment in full of all fees or charges due the
grantee and the payment of an appropriate reconnection charge, if any, the
grantee shall promptly reinstate said service.



   Subscribers and users shall retain the right to deactivate their
terminals, but shall continue to be responsible for charges until the grantee
is notified to terminate service.  The subscriber shall not be charged any
fee for the cancellation of cable service.  Grantee may charge reasonable
fees for service downgrades as permitted under the Cable Act and FCC
Regulations.



   6.   Private Easements.  No cable, line, wire, amplifier,
converter, or other piece of equipment owned by the grantee shall be
installed by the grantee within private easements without first securing the
written permission of the owner of the property involved, unless otherwise
permitted under Federal law.



115.32  CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.



   1.   Right to Continuous Service.  It shall be the right of all
subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and
other obligations to the grantee are honored.  In the event that the grantee
elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the City gives
notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this franchise, the grantee
shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted service.  In the event of a change of grantee, or in the event
a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with
the City, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all
subscribers.  During such period, grantee shall be entitled to the revenue
for any period during which it operates the system, and shall be entitled to
reasonable costs for its services when it no longer operates the system.



   2.   Right of City to Operate System.  In the event grantee fails
to operate the system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of
the City or without just cause, the City may, working in conjunction with any
financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise,
operate the system or designate an operator until such time as grantee
restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent
operator is selected.  If the City is required to fulfill this obligation
for the grantee, then during such period as the City fulfills such
obligation, the City shall be entitled to collect all revenues from the
system, and the grantee shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs or
damages in excess of the revenues collected by the City that are the result
of the grantee’s failure to perform.



115.33  RECORDS.



   1.   The City, upon reasonable notice, shall have the right to
inspect at any time during normal business hours, all books, records, maps,
plans, service complaint logs, performance test results and other like
materials of the grantee which relate to the regulation of the franchise and
are maintained at the local office required by ordinance or franchise
agreement, provided that the City shall maintain the confidentiality of any
trade secrets or other proprietary information in the possession of the
grantee and provided further, that records shall be exempt from inspection
pursuant to this section to the extent required by applicable law regarding
subscriber privacy and to the extent such records are protected by law
against discovery in civil litigation.  If any such books or records are not
kept by the local office, or upon reasonable request made available to the
City, and if the City shall determine that an examination of such records is
necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of City’s duties, then
grantee shall make such records available locally.



   2.   The grantee shall at all times maintain the complaint files
required by this chapter, and a full and complete set of plans, records, and
“as-built” maps showing the exact location of all cable system equipment
installed or in use in the franchise area, exclusive of subscriber service
drops.



115.34  REGULATORY AUTHORITY.



   The City shall exercise regulatory authority under the provisions of
this chapter, the Cable Act, and applicable law.  If the franchise area
served by the cable system also serves other contiguous or neighboring
communities, the City may, at its sole option, participate in a joint
regulatory agency, with delegated responsibility in the area of cable and
related communications.



115.35  REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY.



   The City, acting alone or acting jointly with other cities, may
exercise or delegate the following regulatory responsibilities:



   1.   Administering and enforcing the provisions of the cable
communications system franchises;



   2.   Coordinating the operation of public educational and government
(PEG) access channel and facilities;



   3.   Providing technical, programming, and operational support to
public agency users, such as government departments, schools, and health care
institutions;



   4.   Establishing procedures and standards for use of channels
dedicated to public use and sharing of public facilities;



   5.   Planning expansion and growth of public benefit cable services;



   6.   Analyzing the possibility of integrating cable communications
with other local, regional or national telecommunications networks;



   7.   Formulating and recommending long-range telecommunications
policy.



115.36  PUBLIC USAGE OF THE SYSTEM.



   1.   The City may utilize a portion of the cable communication
system capacity, and associated facilities and resources, to develop and
provide cable services that will be in the public interest.  In furtherance
of this purpose, the City may authorize the North Liberty Telecommunications
Commission to establish a nonprofit corporation or other entity to receive
and allocate PEG and institutional network facilities, support funds, and
other considerations provided by the City, the grantee, and/or others.  Such
an entity, if established, may be delegated the following responsibilities:



      A.   Receive and utilize or reallocate for utilization,
channel capacity, facilities, funding, and other support provided
specifically for PEG and institutional network usage of the cable
communications system.



      B.   Establish, in consultation with the grantee, operational
procedures and guidelines for PEG and institutional network usage.



      C.   Review the status and progress of each service developed
for public benefit.



      D.   Reallocate resources jointly with the grantee on a
periodic basis to conform to changing priorities and public needs.



      E.   Report to the City and the grantee annually on the
utilization of resources, the new public services developed, and the benefits
achieved for the City and its residents.



   2.   The grantee shall make available leased access in compliance
with Section 532 of the Act and applicable FCC regulations.



115.37  RATES.



   The grantee shall establish rates for its services which shall be
applied on a nondiscriminatory basis in the service area, except for
commercial and bulk account rates, which are negotiated individually. 
Grantee may establish a non-uniform rate structure for cable services for
which rates are deregulated under Federal law.  Pursuant to Federal law, the
City reserves the right to assume regulation of rates paid by cable
subscribers; such rate regulation shall be performed by the North Liberty
Telecommunications Commission as advisory to the Council in accordance with
FCC Rules and Regulations Part 76, Subpart N.  As specified by the FCC’s
Rules (Part 76, Subpart N), such rate regulation shall cover basic service
rates and customer premises installations and equipment rates (including
charges for, but not be limited to:  converter boxes, remote control units,
connections for additional television receivers, and other cable home
wiring).  The City reserves the right to further regulate rates pursuant to
any additional powers granted it by either the FCC or Federal or State law.



   1.   Rate Regulatory Procedures.  In the event that rate regulatory
powers are assumed by City, the following shall apply:



      A.   The City shall notify the grantee of City’s FCC
certification and of City’s adoption of rate regulations which are
consistent with the FCC regulations and which provide for a reasonable
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.



      B.   Upon receipt of such notification by grantee, basic
service regulation shall become effective.  Before any proposed adjustment
to basic service rates, grantee shall, within 30 days before such proposed
rate increase becomes effective, submit for review its basic service,
installation, and equipment rates and supporting documentation using the
applicable FCC calculations and forms.



   2.   Proprietary Information.  To aid in the evaluation of the
grantee’s proposed rates, the North Liberty Telecommunications Commission
may require the production of proprietary information, and in such cases will
apply procedures analogous to those set forth in FCC Regulations (47 C.F.R.
Sec. 0.459) and consistent with Federal and State law.



   3.   Refunds.  As specified in the FCC regulations, the
Telecommunications Commission may recommend to the Council that the grantee
refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates which have been
found to be unreasonable.  Before recommending that the grantee refund
previously paid rates to subscribers, the Telecommunications Commission must
give the grantee notice and opportunity to comment.



   4.   Basic Service Rate Increases and Equipment Charges.  All
subsequent requests by the grantee for increases in equipment changes and/or
basic service rates shall be subject to the procedures outlined in this
section.



   5.   Service Disconnection.  A subscriber shall have the right to
have his/her service completely disconnected without charge, which shall
include the removal of any equipment owned by the grantee from the
subscriber’s residence.  Such disconnection shall be made as soon as
practicable and in no case later than 30 days following written notice to the
grantee of same.  No grantee shall enter into any agreement with a
subscriber which imposes any charge following complete disconnection of
service, except for reconnection and subsequent monthly or periodic charges,
and those charges shall be no greater than charges for new customers.  This
section shall not prevent a grantee from refusing service to any person
because of the grantee’s prior accounts with that person which remain due
and owing.  Grantee may charge reasonable charges for service downgrades.



   6.   Subscriber Complaints.  Subscribers may file complaints with
the City regarding a grantee’s expanded tier rates that are subject to
regulation by the FCC by submitting written comments to the Clerk’s
office.  Such complaints must be received within 90 days after the effective
date of the new rate.



115.38  PERFORMANCE REVIEW.



   At City’s sole option, the City may hold a public hearing at which
the grantee shall be present and shall participate to review the performance
and quality of service of the cable system.  The report required in this
chapter regarding subscriber complaints, the records of performance tests,
and the opinion survey reports shall be utilized as the basis for review. 
In addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints during the
review meetings, either orally or in writing, and these shall be considered.



   1.   Performance Report.  Within 30 days after the conclusion of
the public hearing, City shall issue a report with respect to the adequacy of
system performance and quality of service.  If inadequacies are found, City
may direct grantee to correct the inadequacies within a reasonable period of
time.



   2.   Breach Upon Failure to Cure.  Failure of grantee, after due
notice, to correct the inadequacies, shall be considered a breach of the
franchise, and City may, at its sole discretion, exercise any remedy within
the scope of this chapter considered appropriate.



115.39  SYSTEM REVIEW.



   To provide for technological, economic, and regulatory changes in the
state of the art of cable communications, to facilitate renewal procedures,
to promote the maximum degree of flexibility in the cable system, and to
achieve a continuing, advanced modern system, the following system and
services review procedures are established:



   1.   At City’s sole option, the City may hold a public hearing, at
which the grantee shall be present and shall participate, to review the cable
communication system and service.



   2.   Grantee shall submit a report to the City within 45 days of
City’s request, indicating the following:



      A.   All developments and improvements in other cable systems
owned or operated by the grantee, excluding tests and demonstrations.



      B.   Any specific plans for provision of such new services by
the grantee, or a justification indicating why grantee believes that such
services are not feasible for the franchise area.



   3.   Topics for discussion and review at the system and services
review hearing include, but are not limited to, services provided,
feasibility of providing new services, application of new technologies,
system performance, programming, subscriber complaints, user complaints,
rights of privacy, amendments to the franchise, undergrounding processes,
developments in the law, and regulatory constraints, and the community’s
cable-related future needs and interests.



   4.   Either the City or the grantee may select additional topics for
discussion at any review hearing.



115.40  ANNUAL REPORTS.



   Upon written request of the City, within 120 days after the close of
grantee’s fiscal year, the grantee will be required to submit a written
annual report, in a form requested by the City, including (but not limited
to) the following information:



   1.   A summary of the previous year’s (or in the case of the
initial report year, the initial year’s) activities in development of the
cable system, including (but not limited to) services begun or discontinued
during the reporting year, and the number of subscribers for each class of
service;



   2.   A revenue statement, audited by an independent certified public
accountant, or certified by an officer of the grantee;



   3.   A statement of projected construction, if any, for the next two
years;



   4.   A list of grantee’s officers, members of its council of
directors, and other principals of grantee;



   5.   A list of stockholders or other equity investors holding five
percent or more of the voting interest in the grantee and its parent,
subsidiary, and affiliated corporations and other entities, if any, unless
the parent is a public corporation whose annual reports are publicly
available.  A prospectus is requested but does not necessarily satisfy
requirements in this section.



115.41  SYSTEM SURVEY REPORTS.



   Along with the annual report required by this chapter, upon City’s
request, the grantee shall submit to the City an annual system survey report
which shall be a survey of the grantee’s plans and a report thereon.  Said
report shall include, but not be limited to, a description of and
“as-built” maps of the portions of the franchise area that have been
cabled and of all services available and an appropriate engineering test
report or evaluation including suitable electronic measurements conducted in
conformity with such requirements.  Said report shall be in sufficient
detail to enable the City to ascertain that the service requirements and
technical standards of the franchise are achieved and maintained.



115.42  COMPLAINT FILE AND REPORTS.



   An accurate and comprehensive file shall be kept by the grantee for 18
months of any and all written or documented complaints regarding the cable
system.  Grantee shall establish a procedure to remedy complaints quickly
and reasonably to the satisfaction of the City.  Complete records of
grantee’s actions in response to all complaints shall be kept.



   1.   A summary of service requests, identifying the number and
nature of the requests and their disposition, shall be completed for each
month and submitted quarterly when requested in writing by the City.



   2.   Grantee shall maintain a log and summary of all major service
outages within the preceding three years.



115.43  OTHER REPORTS AND INSPECTIONS.



   In addition to other reports or inspections provided by this chapter,
grantee shall provide the following reports to or permit the following
inspections by City:



   1.   Copies of Federal and State Reports.  The grantee may be
required to submit to the City copies of all pleadings, applications,
notifications, communications, and documents of any kind, submitted by the
grantee to – as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence, and
actions by – any Federal, State, and local courts, regulatory agencies, and
other government bodies relating to its cable television operations within
the franchise area.  Grantee shall submit such documents to the City no
later than 30 days after receipt of a City request.



   2.   Public Reports.  A copy of each of grantee’s annual and
other periodic public financial reports and those of its parent, subsidiary,
and affiliated corporation and other entities, as the City requests, shall be
submitted to the City within 30 days after receipt of a request.



   3.   Miscellaneous Reports.  Grantee shall submit to the City such
other information or reports in such forms and at such times as the City may
reasonably request or require.



   4.   Inspection of Facilities.  The grantee shall allow the City to
make inspections of any of the grantee’s facilities and equipment at any
time upon at least ten days’ notice, or in case of emergency, upon demand
without prior notice, to allow City to verify the accuracy of any submitted
report.



   5.   Public Inspection.  All reports subject to public disclosure
shall be available for public inspection at a designated local grantee office
during normal business hours.



   6.   Failure to Report.  The willful refusal, failure, or neglect
of the grantee to file any of the reports reasonably required, or such other
reports as the City reasonably may request, may be deemed a breach of the
franchise, and may subject the grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable,
which are available to the City under the franchise or otherwise.



   7.   False Statements.  Any materially false or misleading
statement or representation made knowingly and willfully by the grantee in
any report required under the franchise may be deemed a breach of the
franchise and may subject the grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable,
which are available to the City under the franchise or otherwise.



   8.   Cost of Reports.  One copy of all reports and records required
under this or any other section shall be furnished at the sole expense of the
grantee.



115.44  REMEDIES FOR FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.



   If the grantee fails to perform any material obligation under the
franchise, or fails to do so in a timely manner, the City may, at its option,
bring civil action, and/or seek remedies as provided in franchise
agreement.  The City may:



   1.   Assess against the grantee monetary damages up to the limits
established in the franchise agreement for material franchise violations,
said assessment to be collected by City after completion of the procedures
specified in Section 115.11 of this chapter.  The amount of such assessment
shall be deemed to represent liquidated damages actually sustained by City by
reason of grantee’s failure to perform.  Such assessment shall not
constitute a waiver by the City of any other right or remedy it may have
under the franchise or under applicable law, including without limitation,
its right to recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and
expenses, including actual attorney fees, as may have been suffered or
incurred by City by reason of or arising out of such breach of the
franchise.  This provision for assessment of damages is intended by the
parties to be separate and apart from City’s right to enforce the
provisions of the construction and performance bonds provided for in this
chapter and is intended to provide compensation to City for actual damages.



   2.   Terminate the franchise, for any of the causes stated in this
chapter.



   3.   No remedy shall be imposed by City against grantee for any
violation of the franchise without grantee being afforded due process of law,
as provided for in the franchise agreement.



   4.   If the grantee fails to perform any material obligations under
the franchise, City may assess monetary damages against the grantee. 
Grantee shall be provided due process of law as provided in the franchise
agreement and applicable local, State, Federal laws and FCC Rules and
Regulations prior to any actual assessments of monetary damages.



115.45  NONPERFORMANCE EXCUSED.



   In the event grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions,
obligations, or requirements of the franchise is prevented or impaired due to
any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such
inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or
sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided grantee has notified
City within a reasonable time after grantee’s discovery of the occurrence
of such an event.  Such causes beyond grantee’s reasonable control or not
reasonably foreseeable shall include, but are not limited to, acts of nature
and civil emergencies.



115.46  CONSTRUCTION BOND.



   1.   Requirement of Bond.  Within 30 days after the granting of a
new franchise, or a renewal which requires significant system construction,
and prior to the commencement of any construction work by the grantee, the
grantee shall file with the City a construction bond in the amount specified
in the franchise agreement in favor of the City and any other person who may
claim damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the grantee assured by
said bond.



   2.   Form of Bond.  Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in
the form approved by the City and shall, among other matters, cover the cost
of removal of any properties installed by the grantee in the event said
grantee shall default in the performance of its franchise obligations.



   3.   No Limitation on Liability.  In no event shall the amount of
said bond be construed to limit the liability of the grantee for damages.



   4.   Waiver of Bond.  The City, at its sole option, may waive this
requirement, or permit consolidation of the construction bond with the
performance bond specified in Section 115.47.



   5.   Release of Bond.  Upon completion of construction, any
construction bonds then in force shall be released.



115.47  PERFORMANCE BOND.



   1.   The City may require any successor, assignee, or transferee of
the grantee to file with the City a performance bond in an amount as
specified in the franchise agreement prior to the commencement of
operation.  The performance bond shall be in favor of the City, and the City
may be entitled to damages as a result of any occurrence in the operation of
or termination of the cable system operated under this chapter or the
franchise agreement.



   2.   Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in the form approved
by the City.



   3.   In no event shall the amount of said bond be construed to limit
the liability of the grantee for damages.



   4.   Within ten days after execution of the franchise agreement, the
grantee shall deposit with the City Clerk, and maintain on deposit through
the term of this franchise, the sum of $10,000.00 as security for the
faithful performance by it of all the provisions of the franchise and
compliance with all orders, permits, and directions of any agency of the City
having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the contract, and the
payment by the grantee of any claims, liens, and taxes due the City which
arise by reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system.



   5.   Within ten days after notice that any amount has been withdrawn
from the security fund deposited pursuant to subsection 1 of this section,
the grantee shall pay to, or deposit with, the City Clerk a sum of money
sufficient to restore such security fund to the original amount of $10,000.00.



   6.   If the grantee fails to pay to the City any compensation within
the time fixed herein; or fails after ten days’ notice to pay to the City
any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay to the City within such ten days
any damages, costs, or expenses which the City shall be compelled to pay by
reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection with the franchise;
or fails after three days’ notice of such failure by the Council to comply
with any provision of the contract which the Council reasonably determines
can be remedied by an expenditure of the security, the Clerk may immediately
withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the
security fund.  Upon such withdrawal, the Clerk shall notify the company of
the amount and date thereof.



   7.   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall
become the property of the City in the event that the contract is cancelled
by reason of the default of the grantee.  The grantee, however, shall be
entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains
on deposit at the expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that
there is then no outstanding default on the part of the grantee.  Interest
earned by the investment of the security fund will accrue to the grantee.



   8.   The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security
fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by
this chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of
a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the
City may have.



115.48  WORK PERFORMED BY OTHERS.



   1.   The grantee shall give prior notice to the City specifying the
names and addresses of any entity, other than the grantee, that performs
construction services in excess of $10,000.00 pursuant to the franchise,
provided, however, that all provisions of the franchise remain the
responsibility of the grantee.



   2.   All provisions of a franchise shall apply to any subcontractor
or others performing any work or services pursuant to the provisions of the
franchise.



   3.   Nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing the
transfer of any rights or responsibilities of the grantee without approval of
the City in writing.



115.49  GRANTEE INSURANCE.



   1.   Insurance Required.  The grantee shall maintain, throughout
the term of the franchise, insurance in amounts at least as follows:



      A.   Worker’s Compensation.  Worker’s compensation with
Coverage A at statutory limits and Coverage B at limits of $500,000. 
Insurance shall cover the employees of the grantee in compliance with the
State of Iowa and all other states having jurisdiction over each employee.



      B.   Comprehensive General Liability.  Comprehensive general
liability including premises/operations; products/completed operations; broad
form property damage; contractual liability; coverage for explosion,
collapse, and underground hazards; and pollution control liability shall
include limits of not less than one million dollars for bodily injury
(including death) and property damage for each occurrence and not less than
one million dollars in the aggregate.



      C.   Umbrella Liability.  Umbrella liability with limits of
not less than two million dollars and carrying the following endorsement: 
It is hereby understood and agreed that despite anything to the contrary
where underlying insurance, as described herein, provides greater protection
or indemnity to the insured than the terms and conditions of this policy,
this insurance shall pay on behalf of the insured the same terms, conditions,
and coverage which apply to the basic underlying insurance.  Where no such
broader underlying insurance exists, this policy shall pay on behalf of the
insured upon terms and conditions and limitations of the carrier’s umbrella
excess policy.



   2.   Certificates to City.  The grantee shall furnish the City with
copies of such insurance policies or certificates of insurance within 45 days
of the effective date of the franchise agreement.  Certificates of insurance
shall be furnished by the grantee to the City annually thereafter.



   3.   City as Additional Insured.  Such insurance policies provided
for herein shall name the City as additional insured, and shall be primary to

Should any of the above described policies be cancelled before the expiration
date thereof, the issuing company will endeavor to mail 30 days’ written
notice to the certificate holder named.



   4.   No Limitation on Liability.  The minimum amounts set forth in
the franchise agreement for such insurance shall not be construed to limit
the liability of the grantee to the City under the franchise issued hereunder
to the amount of such insurance.



   5.   Approved Insurers.  All insurance carriers providing coverage
under subsection 1 of this section shall be duly licensed to operate in the
State of Iowa.



115.50  INDEMNITY.



   1.   Extent of Indemnity.  The grantee shall, by acceptance of any
franchise granted, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, its
officers, boards, commissions, agents, and employees from any and all claims,
suits, judgments for damages or other relief, costs, and attorney’s fees in
any way existing out of or through or alleged to arise out of or through:



      A.   The act of the City in granting the franchise.



      B.   The acts or omissions of grantee, its servants,
employees, or agents, including (but not limited to) any failure or refusal
by grantee, its servants, employees, or agents to comply with any obligation
or duty imposed on grantee by this chapter or the franchise agreement.



      C.   The exercise of any right or privilege granted or
permitted by this chapter or the franchise agreement.



   Such indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, all claims
arising in tort, contract, infringements of copyright, violations of
statutes, ordinances or regulations, or otherwise.



   2.   Defense of Claims.  In the event any claims shall arise, the
City or any other indemnified party shall tender the defense thereof to the
grantee.  Provided, however, the City or other indemnified party in its sole
discretion may participate in the defense of such claims at grantee’s sole
expense, and in such event, such participation shall not relieve the grantee
from its duty or defense against liability or of paying any judgment entered
against such party.  Grantee shall not agree to any settlement of claims
without City approval.



   3.   City’s Negligence.  The grantee shall not be required to
indemnify the City for negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
City’s officials, boards, commissions, agents, or employees.



115.51  ALTERNATE REMEDIES.



   No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to bar the right of the
City to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provision of
the franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement, or directive promulgated
thereunder.  Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this
chapter nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit
the right of the City to recover monetary damages (including all
dispute-related expenses such as attorneys’ fees and except where
liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the
grantee, or judicial enforcement of the grantee’s obligations by means of
specific performance, injunctive relief or mandate, or any other judicial
remedy available at law or in equity.  All judicial action sought for
violation of any provision of the franchise or any rule, regulation,
requirement, or directive promulgated thereunder shall be commenced in the
Johnson County District Court.



115.52  NON-ENFORCEMENT.



   Subject to the provisions of the Act, a grantee shall not be relieved
of any obligation to comply with any of the provisions of the franchise or
any rule, regulation, requirement, or directive promulgated thereunder by
reason of any failure of the City or its officers, agents, or employees to
enforce prompt compliance, nor shall such be considered a waiver thereof.



115.53  COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.



   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary,
the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the
State and Federal government or any administrative agencies thereof. 
Provided, however, if any such State or Federal law or regulation requires
the grantee to perform any service, or permits the grantee to perform any
service, or prohibits the grantee from performing any service, in conflict
with the terms of the franchise or any law or regulation of the City, then as
soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the
City of the point of conflict believed to exist between such regulation or
law and the laws or regulations of the City or the franchise.



115.54  UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION OR SALE OF CABLE SERVICES.



   1.   It is unlawful for any person to lawfully obtain any cable
signal or service from a grantee and to resell such cable signal or service
without the prior written consent of such grantee.



   2.   It is unlawful for any person to intercept, descramble, decode,
or receive or assist in the interception, descrambling, decoding, or
receiving of any cable signal or service of a grantee without the prior
written consent of grantee.  As used in this subsection, “assist in
interception, descrambling, decoding, or receiving” includes the
manufacture or distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or
distributor for unauthorized reception of cable signal or service.



   3.   It is unlawful for any person to intentionally damage any
cables, lines or equipment of any grantee used in or for the purpose of
transmitting cable signals or service.



   4.   It is unlawful for any person to obtain cable signals or
service from any grantee by means of fraud, deceit, or theft.



115.55  WAIVER OR EXEMPTION.



   The City reserves the right to waive provisions of this chapter – or
exempt a grantee from meeting provisions of this chapter – if the City
determines such waiver or exemption is in the public interest.



115.56  FORCE MAJEURE.



   Any delay, preemption, or other failure to provide cable service and to
perform other duties contained in this chapter and the franchise agreement by
the grantee caused by factors beyond the grantee’s control, such as acts of
God, labor disputes, non-delivery by program suppliers, war, riots,
government order or regulation, shall not result in a breach of the terms of
this chapter and franchise agreement.  Grantee shall exercise its reasonable
efforts to cure any such delays and the cause thereof, and performance under
the terms of this chapter and franchise agreement shall be excused by the
city for the period of time during which such factors continue.

117.01  GRANT OF FRANCHISE. 



   There is hereby granted to Linn County Rural Electric Cooperative
Association, hereinafter referred to as the “Cooperative,” its electrical
energy suppliers as necessary to provide the Cooperative distribution at
25,000 Volts or less, its successors and assigns, the right and franchise to
construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain and operate in the City of North
Liberty, Johnson County, Iowa, systems for the distribution of electric
power, and the right to construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain and operate
the necessary poles, lines, wires, conduits and other appurtances for the
distribution of electric power and energy along, under and upon the streets,
avenues, alleys and public ways in the City of North Liberty, Johnson County,
Iowa; also the right to erect and maintain upon the streets, avenues, alleys
and public ways, distribution lines through the City of North Liberty,
Johnson County, Iowa, to supply individuals, corporations, communities and
municipalities both inside and outside of the City with electric light and
power for the period of twenty-five (25) years, after which such period the
franchise shall expire.  However, the City of North Liberty shall retain the
right to terminate this right and franchise effective at the end of the tenth
(10 th ), fifteenth (15 th ), and twentieth (20 th ) year anniversary of the
Anniversary Date as defined within.  In order to exercise this right to
terminate the right and franchise granted to the Cooperative, the City of
North Liberty must give written notice to the Cooperative no later than six
(6) months prior to expiration of the respective Anniversary Date.  The
Anniversary Date shall be the date this franchise is published following
signature by the Mayor.  †



117.02  INDEMNIFICATION. 



   1.   The Cooperative shall indemnify, defend and hold the City
harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, cost
and expenses (including, but not limited to, court costs, fines, penalties
and reasonable attorney’s fees, but excluding consequential or indirect
damages), judgments, liabilities and causes of action of any nature
whatsoever resulting from or relating to its negligent acts or omissions in
the use or occupancy of the streets, avenues, alleys and public ways in the
City, a default of this franchise, or arising in any manner out of the
negligent acts or omissions of its agents, employees, or contractors in
connection with same, or with respect to the violation of any laws, including
without limitation, any environmental laws; provided, however, that the
Cooperative shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify or save harmless the
City for any costs or damages arising from the negligence of the City, its
officers, employees or contractors.  The Cooperative shall indemnify and
defend the City for, from and against any and all mechanic’s liens and
other liens and encumbrances filed by any person claiming by, through or
under the Cooperative and against all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities
(including reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred by the City in connection
with any such lien or encumbrance or any action or proceeding brought thereon.



   2.   The Cooperative shall maintain commercial general liability
insurance coverage, or its equivalent, throughout the term of this franchise,
so as to protect and indemnify the City from suits or claims arising out of
the Cooperative’s negligent acts subject to policy terms and conditions. 
Such insurance shall be comprehensive in nature, including, but not limited
to, contractual liability.  In addition, such insurance shall contain limits
not less than $1,000,000 combined single-limit person injury and property
damage.  The Cooperative’s failure to meet this insurance requirement
shall not relieve the Cooperative of its responsibilities under this
franchise.  Upon proof of financial responsibility to the reasonable
satisfaction of the City, the Cooperative may be allowed to self-insure the
coverages indicated herein resulting from the negligent acts or omissions of
the Cooperative, the Cooperative’s agents or employees.  The Cooperative
shall provide the City with certificates of insurance or a letter of
self-insurance upon request.



   3.   The requirements of indemnification shall not be a waiver of
any right that the City would have to assert defenses on its own behalf under
state or federal law.  The Cooperative’s indemnification obligations under
this franchise shall survive the expiration, cancellation, or termination of
this franchise in accordance with applicable statutes of limitation in force
within the State of Iowa.



117.03  METERS AND SERVICE LINES .  



   The Cooperative, its successors and assigns shall furnish and install
all meters at its own expense, and shall provide the service wire to
buildings as set forth in the Cooperative’s tariff filed with the Iowa
Utilities Board.



117.04  RIGHT TO OPERATE AND LOCATE FACILITIES. 



   The Cooperative shall have the right to erect and maintain all
necessary poles and to place thereon the necessary wires, fixture and
accessories as well as excavate and bury conductors and install and place
other underground electric system facilities and fixtures for the
distribution of electric power and energy in and through the City.  New
electric distribution lines in new developments within the City shall be
installed underground unless otherwise approved by the City.  Said
facilities shall not unreasonably interfere with the construction of any
water pipes, drain or sewer, or the flow of water therefrom, which have been
or may hereafter be located by authority of the City.



117.05  RELOCATION.



   The Cooperative shall, at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its
existing facilities or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or
alley in the City in such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably
require for the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction,
maintenance or repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in
or about any such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficiency
operation of any such improvement.  If the City orders or requests the
Cooperative to relocate its existing facilities or equipment as the result of
the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other non-public
entity, the Cooperative shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation
the respective commercial or private developer or other non-public entity as
a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.  The City
shall give the Cooperative reasonable advance written notice to vacate a
public right-of-way.  Vacating a public right-of-way at the request of a
commercial or private developer or other non-public entity shall not deprive
the Cooperative of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities,
until the reasonable cost of relocating the same for commercial or private
purposes are paid to the Cooperative.  In any event, the City shall utilize
reasonable efforts to assist the Cooperative in securing an easement or other
continued rights of record to continue to operate and maintain its facilities
upon such relocation.



117.06  MAPPING. 



   Upon reasonable request, the Cooperative shall provide to the City, on
a project specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location,
relative to the boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it
owns or over which it has control and which is located in the project
right-of way.  Mapping information provided to the City by the Cooperative
shall be in the format utilized by the Cooperative and shall be for the
exclusive use of the City in administering the use and occupancy of the
public rights-of-way within the City and shall not be provided to or relied
on by any person for any other purpose.  Any information provided to the
City with respect to the location or type of equipment which the Cooperative
owns or plans to install in the right-of-way shall be treated as confidential
information or a trade secret and shall not be released to any party by the
City without the prior written consent of the Cooperative.  If requested,
the Cooperative shall submit to the City complete mapping data specific to
particular projects.  At the request of the City, mapping information will
be reviewed with the City staff.  The Cooperative does not warrant or
guarantee the accuracy of any information provided pursuant to this
section.  The Cooperative’s maps only show equipment and facilities that
are above ground.



117.07  ANNUAL PLANNING MEETING. 



   The Cooperative operations staff will, at the request of the City,
attend an annual meeting with City staff and other interested city entities
to discuss utility reliability standards, including comparisons to regional
and national reliability statistics, annual and long-term construction
planning for the Cooperative and the City, tree trimming plans and other
related items.  This will not replace any periodic meetings needed on
specific projects and issues.



117.08  RIGHT-OF-WAY RESTORATION. 



   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places
the Cooperative shall not unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets, and
shall replace the surface, restoring the original condition.



117.09  UNDERGROUNDING. 



   The City may request estimates for the undergrounding of replacement
lines, upgrades or new lines, including lines to be adjusted for road moves,
for specific projects addressed at the annual planning meeting.  When
requested, the Cooperative will provide to the City two estimates: 1) An
estimate for the cost of the project with overhead construction and 2) An
estimate for the cost of the project with underground construction.  If the
City disputes the Cooperative’s cost estimates, the City may request a
third-party engineering estimate by a mutually agreed upon firm.  The City
will have no more than 60 days from the estimate date to determine if it
wants the line built overhead or placed underground.  If the City chooses
underground construction for the project, the City will be responsible for
the incremental cost of undergrounding, defined as the differential between
the estimate for underground construction and the estimate for overhead
construction.



117.10  NON-EXCLUSIVITY .  



   The franchise granted by this ordinance shall not be exclusive.



117.11  CONTINUOUS SERVICE. 



   Service to be rendered by the Cooperative under this franchise shall be
continuous unless prevented from doing so by fire, acts of God, unavoidable
accidents or casualties, or reasonable interruptions necessary to properly
service the Cooperative’s equipment, and in such event service shall be
resumed as quickly as is reasonably possible.



117.12  CITY USE OF COOPERATIVE FACILITIES. 



   The Cooperative, upon request of the City, and without cost to it, may
permit its poles, conduits and other distribution facilities, so far as may
be done without interfering with the free use its own wires and fixtures, to
be used for the purpose of maintenance thereon any control wires and other
appurtances which may be necessary for any use by the City.  Upon an
agreement between the Cooperative and the City, these parties shall enter
into a Pole-Sharing Agreement to document the location and obligations of the
parties related to the City’s use of the Cooperative’s facilities.



117.13  ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. 



   The Cooperative will provide the City energy efficiency materials and
incentive forms for display in the Building Department and other City
departments as requested by the City.  The Cooperative will participate in
neighborhood and community events, when possible and upon a request from the
City or neighborhood organization, to encourage City residents to utilize the
Cooperative’s energy efficiency programs.



117.14  FUTURE AGREEMENTS. 



   The Cooperative, upon request of the City, shall explore with the City
agreements that are mutually beneficial and economically feasible to both
parties for interconnection of alternative energy electrical facilities, use
of facilities and purchase of excess alternatively produced power in a timely
manner, adhering to all federal, state or local codes, rules and regulations
in effect at the time of agreement.  The Cooperative will work with the City
for fair regulatory treatment of such projects.  Agreements are subject to
generation reliability requirements.



117.15  STREET LIGHTS. 



   At the request of the City, the Cooperative shall provide the City with
a count of metered and/or leased streetlights within the City limits and
within the service territory of the Cooperative.  If the City would at any
time desire to purchase the Cooperative’s street lights located within the

The terms and conditions of such a sale will include that the street lights
will be purchased at a mutually agreed price and on an as is, where is
basis.  Upon sale, the City shall assume all risk and loss related to the
operation and maintenance of the purchased street lighting.  Any agreement
will require the City to purchase all street lights in the corporate limits
of the City that are owned by the Cooperative.

may adopt a franchise fee as a percentage of gross receipts from the sale of
electricity for customers within the City limits of North Liberty, Johnson
County, Iowa.  The Cooperative shall commence collecting the franchise fee
within six months of the date the City notifies the Cooperative of adoption
of a franchise fee.  The franchise fee may increase up to a maximum of five
percent (5%) as allowed by law.  The City shall be solely responsible for
the proper use of any amounts collected as franchise fees, and shall only use
such fees as collected for a purpose as allowed by applicable law. 
Collection of the franchise fee shall cease at the earlier of the City’s
repeal of the franchise fee or the end of the franchise term. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the collection of any franchise fee shall be
in accordance with applicable law, including but not limited to any
limitations upon the collection of such franchise fee.



   2.   The franchise fee shall be applied to all customers’ bills in
accordance with Iowa Code Section 364.2(f) and 423B.5, as amended, and
subject to any modifications or the repeal of same.  Only the City may grant

applicable at the time of such exemption or refund.  If at any time the Iowa
Utilities Board or another authority having proper jurisdiction prohibits the
collection or payment of a franchise fee, the Cooperative shall be relieved
of its obligation to collect and pay to the City the franchise fee.



   3.   The City agrees that the Cooperative’s obligations related to
the franchise fee are limited to those obligations set forth in this
section.  The City further agrees to bear all costs (including attorney
fees), and to defend, indemnify and hold the Cooperative harmless from any
and all liability, claims or causes of action associated with disputes
related to the billing and/or collections of the franchise fee, provided that
the City shall not be obligated to bear such costs or to defend, indemnify
and hold the Cooperative harmless if such disputes are the result of
inaccurate billing or negligence by the Cooperative.



   4.   Upon receipt of a final and unappealable order or approval
authorizing annexation, or changes in the limits of the City, the City Clerk
shall provide written notification to an officer of the Cooperative of such
annexation or change in the limits of the City, and the Cooperative shall

change in the limits of the City, commencing no later than six (6) months
from the effective date of the annexation.

any additional charges related to this section shall be shown separately on
the utility bill to each member.



   6.   The Cooperative shall remit collected franchise fees to the
City on a basis determined by the City, but no more frequently than monthly,

future placed anywhere in the corporate limits of the City, either as now
existing or hereafter extended, not in a public street and a street shall
thereafter be opened or dedicated so as to include said line within the
right-of-way of such street, said electric line shall then be operated and
maintained under the terms of this franchise, provided the Company first
receives reasonable compensation in accordance with Section 117.05 hereof for
any property rights foregone thereby.



117.19  TREE TRIMMING. 



   The Cooperative is authorized and empowered consistent with this
franchise to prune or remove at the Cooperative’s expense any tree
extending into any street, alley, right-of-way or public grounds to maintain
electric reliability, to promote general safety, to restore utility service,
and to prevent limbs, branches or trunks from interfering with the wires and
facilities of the Cooperative. For scheduled tree trimming that is not
associated with restoration of electric service, the Cooperative shall
provide a one week notice to the City of the locations and specifics of
scheduled tree trimming or pruning. The pruning shall be completed in
accordance with nationally accepted safety and utility industry standards,
ANSI A300-2001, American National Standard for Tree Care Operations, and ANSI
Z133-2006 Pruning, Repairing, Maintaining and Removing Trees, and Cutting
Brush Safety Requirements, or subsequent revisions to these standards, and
City ordinances regarding the trimming of trees and the protection of its
facilities upon public grounds. The removal of trees or pruning in public

situations shall require prior approval from the City.



117.20  ABANDONED FACILITIES. 



The Cooperative shall not be required to remove abandoned facilities from the
right-of-way if the act of removal causes degradation of the right-of-way,
potential damage to other facilities, or if the Cooperative facilities may,
at a reasonable future date, be placed back into service. The City may
require the Cooperative to demonstrate the potential for any of these
circumstances.



117.21  COMPLIANCE WITH CITY ORDINANCES.

Except as set forth in Section 117.21, in no event shall the City of North
Liberty enact any ordinance or place any limitations, either operationally or
through the assessment of fees, that create additional burdens upon the
Cooperative, or which delay utility operations with respect to the right
contained herein.

   This franchise grants the Cooperative the right to exercise powers of
eminent domain. The Cooperative shall notify the City of proposed eminent

   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and license the operation of
any taxi service within the corporate limits of the City by requiring
registration and licensing and providing for the enforcement hereof and
penalties for the violation thereof.



126.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:



   1.   “Driver” means a person authorized by the City to drive a
taxi.



   2.   “Operator” means any person, whether or not the owner of a
taxi, who will profit financially by the operation of a taxi, but does not
include a person hired to drive a taxi.



   3.   “Taxi” means any motor vehicle that is used on the streets
of the City for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire for which public
patronage is solicited within the City.



126.03  LICENSE REQUIRED.



   It is unlawful for any person to operate a taxi service within the City
without a valid taxi license issued under this chapter.  A taxi operated
principally in other cities and licensed thereby that uses the streets of the
City only temporarily and on isolated occasions need not have or obtain a
license under this chapter.



   1.   Taxi License Application.  A taxi operator shall apply in
writing to the City for a license for each taxi.  The application shall
include:



      A.   The name and residential and business addresses of the
operator;



      B.   The experience of the operator in the transportation of
passengers;



      C.   The operator’s record of convictions of misdemeanors
and/or felonies, including moving and nonmoving traffic violations;

have first obtained and shall have then in force a taxi driver license issued
by the City.  The application shall include:



      A.   The name and address of the person;



      B.   The experience of the person in the transportation of
passengers;



      C.   The person’s record of convictions of misdemeanors
and/or felonies, including moving and nonmoving traffic violations;

   The application for a taxi license or a taxi driver license shall be
accompanied by a license fee, as established by resolution of the Council,
for each license.



126.05  INVESTIGATION AND REPORT.



   The Police Chief shall investigate the character of the applicant for a
taxi license or a taxi driver license and shall inspect each taxi to be
licensed, and shall report on these matters.  Such investigations,
inspection, and report may be waived by the City upon showing of a valid
license, duly issued by a municipality which has any portion of a common
corporate boundary with the City in compliance with requirements similar to
or more stringent than those contained in this chapter.



126.06  LIABILITY INSURANCE.



   As a condition to granting a taxi license, the applicant shall file
with the City evidence of liability insurance coverage, via a certificate of
insurance executed by a company authorized to do insurance business in this
State, and that is acceptable to the City and provides the minimum limits set
by Council resolution.  Each certificate of insurance shall require written
notice to the City ten calendar days prior to any nonrenewal, suspension,
cancellation, or termination of coverage.  Failure to maintain such coverage
in full force and effect shall constitute immediate revocation of the license.



126.07  ISSUANCE.



   The City shall promptly review each application and shall issue a
license when the City Administrator determines that there is no information
which would indicate that the issuance of such license would be detrimental
to the safety, health, or welfare of residents of the City.  An application
for a license may be denied based on an adverse driving record, conviction of
other crimes or prior experience of the applicant that demonstrates a
disregard for the safety of others and/or a lack of responsibility.



126.08  LICENSE CONTENTS.



   A license shall contain the signatures of the City Administrator and
City Clerk, the date of issuance, the period for which the license is valid,
the passenger seating capacity of the taxi and the information contained in
the application. 



126.09  DISPLAYING THE LICENSE.



   Each taxi shall have prominently displayed the taxi license and the
taxi driver license.



126.10  TERM OF LICENSE.



   All taxi licenses issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for
one year.  The license fee provided for under this chapter shall be
nonrefundable and not prorated for revocation or suspension.  However, the
license fee shall be prorated for operation of a taxi service for only a
portion of a license period.  The license period shall commence on July 1,
or on the date the operations are started, and shall terminate the last day
in June.  Renewals shall follow the same procedure as set for initial
issuance.



126.11  LICENSE NOT TRANSFERABLE.



   Each taxi license shall be issued for one specific taxi only and shall
not be transferable from taxi to taxi or to a different operator.  The
operator shall notify the City when a licensed taxi is withdrawn from service
to be replaced by another taxi.  A license for the replacement taxi shall be
issued after payment of a transfer fee, as established by resolution of the
Council, subject to compliance with vehicle inspection requirements.



126.12  REVOCATION OF LICENSE.



   The City may revoke or suspend any license issued under this chapter
for the following reasons:



   1.   Fraudulent Statements.  The operator has made fraudulent
statements in the application for the license or in the conduct of business.



   2.   Violation of Law or Ordinance.  The operator has substantially
violated the requirements of this chapter or the State motor vehicle laws.



   3.   Operation as to Endanger Safety, Health, or Welfare.  The
operator has conducted business in a manner that substantially endangers the
public safety, health, welfare, order, or morals.



   A hearing shall be conducted before revoking or suspending a license. 
The operator shall be given notice of the hearing at least five and not more
than 30 days before the date of the hearing.  The notice shall be in writing
and shall be served personally or as required for personal service by the
Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure.  The notice shall state the time and place of
the hearing and the reasons for the intended revocation or suspension.



126.13  RATES.



   Each vehicle for hire shall have prominently displayed a fare rate card
visible to all passenger seats, and each driver shall provide a copy of the
fare rate card to a passenger, when requested.  A passenger of a taxi may
request from the driver an estimate of the fare to be charged, and the driver
may provide such an estimate based on the fares displayed on the rate card. 
The driver shall then charge a fare not to exceed the estimate given plus the
rate card fare for one-half mile.



126.14  VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS.



   Each vehicle for hire shall have the name of the owner or the operating
company painted plainly in letters at least two inches in height on each side
of the vehicle.  Each taxi shall be equipped with an interior light of
sufficient candlepower to amply illuminate the interior of the taxi at all
times.  The light shall be so arranged as to be easily accessible to and
operable by passengers.



126.15  DUTY TO CARRY.



   The driver of a taxi shall have the right to demand payment of the
legal fare in advance and may refuse employment unless so prepaid.  However,
no driver shall otherwise refuse or neglect to convey any orderly person upon
request, unless previously engaged or unable to do so.

rental permit.  The Certificate of Structure Compliance shall state the date
of issuance, the type of structure for which the certificate is being issued,
and the address of the structure to which it is applicable. All dwellings,
dwelling units, or rooming units being let for rent and occupancy without

substantial noncompliance with Section 146.19 that directly affects the
health and/or safety of the occupants therein. The rental inspector who

Structure Compliance requirements and processes set out in this chapter when
used as a rental unit.



      B.   If a manufactured home does not have a State of Iowa seal
and has not been proven to have been constructed in accordance federal or
state standards after February 1, 1973, and is occupied as a rental unit as

that date.  In such cases, it is exempt from the Certificate of Structure
Compliance requirements and processes set out in this chapter, but is subject
to the minimum safety standards set out in Section 146.04(6)(C) below.

amount of which is established by Resolution of the City Council.  The
Rental Permit shall state the date of issuance, the address of the structure
to which it is applicable, the name of the new owner or operator to which it

resolution of the City Council.



   5.   Expiration of Rental Permit. Rental Permits shall be valid
through December 31 of each year, unless the Rental Permit has been suspended
or revoked, and provided that all fees have been paid.

CHAPTER 155
CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND
SEDIMENT CONTROL



 

155.01  Purpose and Intent
 
155.04  Monitoring


155.02  Applicability
 
155.05  Enforcement


155.03  Inspection
 
155.06  Appeals



 



155.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   1.   The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit program administered by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) requires that agencies meeting certain demographic and environmental
impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the discharge of
storm water from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4).  The City
has been issued such a permit.  The City’s MS4 permit is on file at the
office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection during
regular office hours. 



   2.   The NPDES program requires certain individuals engaged in earth
disturbing activities related to construction on one acre of land or more to
submit an application to the IDNR for an NPDES General Permit #2.  The NPDES
program and the City's MS4 permit require the City to adopt an ordinance
requiring proper soil erosion and sediment control on all sites less than one
acre if the earth-disturbing activities are part of a larger common plan of
development that would disturb one acre or more.  Notwithstanding any
provision of this chapter, every applicant bears final and complete
responsibility for compliance with a State NPDES General Permit #2, a City
construction site runoff (CSR) permit, and any other requirement of State or
Federal law or administrative rule.




(Ord. 15-07 - Nov. 15 Supp.)




   3.   As a condition of the City’s MS4 permit, the City is obliged
to undertake primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the
NPDES program by adopting a construction site runoff control ordinance
designed to achieve the following objectives:



      A.   Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership,
corporation, state agency or political subdivision (applicant) required by
law or administrative rule to apply to the IDNR for an NPDES General Permit
#2 shall also be required to obtain from the City a permit in addition to and
not in lieu of the NPDES General Permit #2; and



      B.   The City shall have primary responsibility for
inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures to promote applicants’
compliance with State NPDES General Permits #2 and CSR permits.



   4.   No State or Federal funds have been made available to assist
the City in administering and enforcing the NPDES program.  The City shall
fund its application, inspection, monitoring, and enforcement
responsibilities entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which
are made subject to the program by virtue of State and Federal law, and/or
other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.



155.02  APPLICABILITY.



   1.   All persons who will be conducting any earth-disturbing
activity, as defined in Paragraph 2, on any site in the City shall preserve
and replace existing topsoil in an uncompacted manner.



   2.   All persons required by law or administrative rule to obtain an
NPDES General Permit #2 from the IDNR, and persons who will be conducting any
earth-disturbing activity on a site less than one acre in size if the
earth-disturbing activities are part of a larger common plan of development
that would disturb one acre or more, are required to obtain a CSR permit. 
Earth-disturbing activity means any activity that results in a movement of
earth or a change in the existing soil cover (both vegetative and
non-vegetative) or the existing topography.  Earth-disturbing activity
includes, but is not limited to, clearing, grading, filling, excavation, or
addition or replacement of impervious surface.



   3.   Applications for CSR permits shall be made on forms approved by
the City and which may be obtained from the City.



   4.   An application for a CSR permit shall pay fees as follows:



      A.   Prior to the issuance of a CSR permit in connection with
a building permit on a platted lot, the applicant shall submit an application
permit fee to the Department of Building Safety in an amount established by
resolution of the Council.  If more than three inspections are required by
the terms of this chapter with respect to said permit, the applicant shall
bear the cost of such inspections, which shall be the actual cost of the
inspections by the City.



      B.   There shall be no permit fee required prior to the
issuance of CSR permits other than those issued in connection with building
permits on platted lots, but the applicant shall bear the cost of reviews and
inspections required by the terms of this chapter with respect to said
permits, which shall be the actual cost of the reviews and inspections by the
City.



   5.   An applicant in possession of an NPDES General Permit #2 issued
by the IDNR shall immediately submit to the City full copies of the materials
described below as a basis for the City to determine whether to issue a CSR
permit:



      A.   Applicant’s NPDES General Permit #2 notice of intent
(NOI);



      B.   Applicant’s plans, specifications and materials in
support of applicant’s application for the NPDES General Permit #2; and



      C.   A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) prepared
in accordance with this chapter.



   6.   Every SWPPP submitted to the City in support of an application
for a CSR permit shall:



      A.   Comply with all current minimum mandatory requirements
for SWPPPs promulgated by the IDNR in connection with issuance of an NPDES
General Permit #2;



      B.   Comply with all mandatory minimum requirements pertaining
to the joint application form, “Protecting Iowa Waters,” filed with the
IDNR and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;



      C.   Comply with all other applicable local, State or Federal
permit requirements in existence at the time of application; and



      D.   Include within the SWPPP a signed and dated certification
by the person preparing the SWPPP that the SWPPP complies with all
requirements of this chapter.



   7.   Every SWPPP submitted to the City in support of an application
for a CSR permit shall contain the provisions of the General Permit #2, plus
the following additional provisions.  All SWPPPs shall:



      A.   Comply with Iowa Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications (SUDAS) standard design criteria as amended.



      B.   Address that stockpiles of soil or other materials
subject to erosion by wind or water are covered, vegetated, or otherwise
effectively protected from erosion and sedimentation in accordance with the
amount of time the material will be on site and the manner of its proposed
use; no stockpiling is allowed in the street.



      C.   Assure that all temporary erosion and sediment controls
shall be maintained until the City has determined that the site has been
permanently stabilized.

utility construction areas, as soon as possible.



      K.   Protect adjacent and outlying roads from sediment and mud
from construction site activities, including tracking.



      L.   Provide for disposal of collected sediment and floating
debris.



   8.   Issuance by the City of a CSR permit shall be a condition
precedent for the issuance of a City building permit or site plan approval.



   9.   For so long as a construction site is subject to an NPDES
General Permit #2 or a CSR permit, the applicant shall provide the City with
current information as follows:



      A.   The name, address, and telephone number of the person on
site designated by the owner who is knowledgeable and experienced in erosion
and sediment control and who will oversee compliance with the NPDES General
Permit #2 and the CSR permit.



      B.   The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the
contractors and/or subcontractors that will implement each erosion and
sediment control measure identified in the SWPPP.



      C.   An on-site location for storage and retrieval of the
current SWPPP.



   Applicant’s failure to provide current information shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.



   10.   If the applicant for the NPDES General Permit #2 and the CSR
permit is not the same individual as the owner/builder on the site, then the
applicant has the option to include the owner/builder as a co-permittee. 
Co-permittees have the same obligations and responsibilities as the original
applicant.  Absent written confirmation of transfer of responsibility signed
by both the parties and provided to the City at the office of the enforcement
official, the original applicant remains obligated and responsible for permit
compliance on any parcel of the site, whether the parcel has been sold or not.



   11.   Upon receipt of an application for a CSR permit, the City
shall either find that the application complies with this chapter and issue a
CSR permit in accordance with this chapter, or that the application fails to
comply with this chapter, in which case the City shall provide a written
report identifying noncompliant elements of the application.




(Ord. 15-07 - Nov. 15 Supp.)




155.03  INSPECTION.



   1.   All inspections required under this chapter shall be conducted
by a designated person from the City, hereinafter referred to as the
“enforcement officer.”



   2.   The applicant shall notify the City when all measures required
by applicant’s SWPPP have been accomplished on-site; whereupon, the City
shall conduct an inspection for the purpose of determining compliance with
this chapter and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, report to the
applicant either that compliance appears to have been achieved, or that
compliance has not been achieved, in which case the City shall provide a
written report identifying the conditions of noncompliance.  The applicant
shall immediately commence corrective action and shall complete such
corrective action within a timeframe deemed reasonable by the City.  Failure
to take corrective action in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.



   3.   Unless otherwise approved by the City, construction shall not
occur on the site at any time when the City has identified conditions of
noncompliance.



   4.   Unless approved by the City, construction activities undertaken
by an applicant prior to resolution of all discrepancies specified in the
written report shall constitute a violation of this chapter.



   5.   The City shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect
consequences to the applicant or to third parties for noncompliant conditions
undetected by inspection.



155.04  MONITORING.



   1.   Upon issuance of a CSR permit, the applicant has an absolute
duty to monitor site conditions and to report to the enforcement officer any
change of circumstances or site conditions which the applicant knows or
should know pose a risk of storm water discharge in a manner inconsistent
with applicant’s SWPPP, NPDES General Permit #2 and/or CSR permit.



   2.   Such report shall be made by the applicant to the enforcement
officer immediately upon knowledge of site condition changes, but in any
event within 24 hours of the change of circumstances or site conditions.



   3.   Failure to make a timely report shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.



   4.   Any third party may also report to the City site conditions
which the third party reasonably believes pose a risk of storm water
discharge in a manner inconsistent with applicant’s SWPPP, NPDES General
Permit #2, and/or CSR permit.



   5.   Upon receiving a report pursuant to the previous subsections,
the enforcement officer shall conduct an inspection of the site as soon as
reasonably possible and thereafter may issue a written stop work order to the
applicant, directing the applicant to take no further action with respect to
the SWPPP, NPDES General Permit #2, and/or CSR permit, other than corrective
action provided for herein.  The enforcement officer shall provide the
applicant with a written report identifying the conditions of
noncompliance.  The applicant shall immediately commence corrective action
and shall complete such corrective action within a timeframe deemed
reasonable by the City.  Failure to take corrective action in a timely
manner shall constitute a violation of this chapter, whereupon the
enforcement officer shall immediately commence enforcement actions specified
in subsection 6 of this section.



   6.   The enforcement officer shall conduct at least one unannounced
inspection during the course of construction to monitor compliance with the

156.01  PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to:



   1.   Protect, maintain, and enhance the enhance the environment of
the City and the public health, safety, and general welfare of the public by
adopting as the City’s standards the guidelines established in the Iowa
Storm Water Management Manual (hereinafter referred to as the
“standards”) to manage the storm water runoff to improve water quality
and control the maximum rate of flow to prevent downstream flooding; and



   2.   Enable the City to comply with its National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System Permit (NPDES) and applicable statutes and regulations for
storm water runoff though the following objectives:



      A.   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from development
within the City limits and fringe area in order to reduce flooding,
siltation, increases in stream temperature, and stream bank erosion and
maintain the integrity of stream channels;



      B.   Minimize increases in nonpoint pollution caused by storm
water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;



      C.   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff
which flows from any specific development project site after completion to
not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent
practicable;



      D.   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil
erosion, and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through
establishment of appropriate minimum storm water management standards and
best management practices (BMPs) and to ensure that BMPs are maintained and
pose no threat to public safety.



156.02  FINDINGS.



   1.   The United States Environmental Agency’s (EPA) National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program administered by
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) requires that cities meeting
certain demographic and environmental criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES
permit for the discharge of storm water from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) Permit.  The City is subject to the NPDES permit program and is
required to obtain, and has in fact obtained, an MS4 permit; the City’s MS4
permit is on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public
inspection during regular office hours.



   2.   As a condition of the City’s MS4 permit, the City is obliged
to adopt and enforce a Post-Construction Storm Water Runoff Control Ordinance.



   3.   Land development and associated increases in impervious cover
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition; this storm water runoff contributes to increased
quantities of waterborne pollutants; and storm water runoff, soil erosion,
and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the
regulation of storm water runoff from development sites.



   4.   Therefore, the City establishes this set of City storm water
standards applicable to all surface waters to provide for reasonable guidance
for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local
water resources from degradation.  It is determined that the regulation of
storm water runoff discharges from land development and other construction
activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution associated with storm water runoff, is in the public interest and
will prevent threats to public safety and welfare.



   5.   The determination of appropriate minimum storm water management
standards and the development of effective best management practices to
achieve those standards require technical expertise that may not always be
readily available with the City’s own staff.  Moreover, it is important
that such standards and BMPs be reasonably consistent across the State so
that property owners and developers are not confronted with myriad variations
depending on the location of the development.  The Iowa Storm Water
Management Manual, published collaboratively by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources and the Center for Transportation Research and Education at
Iowa State University established guidelines consisting of unified sizing
criteria, storm water management designs and specifications, and BMPs.  The
City hereby finds and declares that the Iowa Storm Water Management Manual
and future editions thereof, should be and is hereby adopted as the storm
water management standards of the City.  Any BMP installation that complies
with the provisions of the Iowa Storm Water Management Manual, or future
editions thereof, at the time of installation of the BMP shall be deemed to
have been installed in accordance with this chapter.



156.03  APPLICABILITY.



   1.   All persons who will be conducting any land-disturbing
activity, as defined in Section 156.04, on any site in the City shall
preserve and replace existing topsoil in an uncompacted manner.



   2.   This chapter is applicable to all land-disturbing activities
greater than one acre or part of a larger common plan of development.  In
addition, this chapter also applies to all applications for site plans or
subdivisions that are less than one acre, and are commercial, industrial, or
multi-family residential uses as defined by the City’s Zoning Code, unless
requirements of this chapter have been met through approved use of an
off-site location.



   3.   Any development within a preliminary or final plat approved
prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be
deemed exempt from the requirements of this chapter, and re-subdivisions of
lots within the approved platted area shall also be deemed exempt. 
Amendments to plats approved prior to the adoption of such ordinance shall
conform to this chapter unless the amendments are determined by the City
Administrator to be minor in nature.



   4.   For developments where the runoff from up to and including the
100-year storm event can be conveyed directly to Muddy Creek without adverse
impact to intervening property, no overbank flood protection control is
required.  This is provided that it can be shown by hydrograph analysis that
the runoff from the development will arrive at Muddy Creek sufficiently ahead
of the peak flow of the Muddy Creek so as not to increase the peak flow of
said creek.  Water quality volume, channel protection volume, and treatment
are not exempt.



   5.   The following activities are exempt from this chapter:



      A.   Any logging or agricultural activity which is consistent
with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan approved
by an appropriate agency.



      B.   Additions or modifications to single-family homes.



      C.   Repairs to any storm water BMPs deemed necessary by the
City.

165.01  TITLE.



   The regulations contained in Chapters 165 through 173 of this Code of
Ordinances shall be known as the City of North Liberty Zoning Code, may be
cited as such, and are referred to herein as “this code.”



165.02  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this code is to safeguard the health, property, and
public welfare by controlling the design, location, use, or occupancy of all
buildings through the regulated and orderly development of land and land uses
within this jurisdiction.



165.03  SCOPE.



   The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, moving, repair, and use of any building, parcel of land, sign, or
fence within the jurisdiction, except work located primarily in a public way,
public utility poles, and public utilities unless specifically mentioned in
this code.  Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code
specify different requirements, the more restrictive shall govern.  Where
there is conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement,
the specific requirement shall be applicable.  In fulfilling these purposes,
this code is intended to benefit the public as a whole and not any specific
person or class of persons.  Although through the implementation,
administration, and enforcement of this code, benefits and detriments will be
enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals, such is merely a byproduct of
the overall benefit to the whole community; therefore, unintentional breaches
of the obligations of administration and enforcement imposed on the
jurisdiction hereby shall not be enforceable in tort.

Commission and approved by the Council. Single-family and zero-lot site plans
are reviewed for code conformance and approved by the City Building Official,
except for site plans for homes in the RS-9 district. In the RS-9 district,
the lots are small and design considerations are critical; therefore, all
building elevations shall be submitted to the City Planner for review and
approval prior to issuance of a building permit. Said review is intended to
ensure that identical or near-identical homes are not built throughout an
RS-9 area.




(Ord. 2016-10 – Nov. 16 Supp.)




      B.   An approved site plan may be amended with respect to
location, size, design, and conformity of buildings and other improvements,
provided that the amended site plan conforms to the general use regulations,
performance standards, and provisions of the district in which located. 
Amended site plans shall be reviewed by the Commission and approved by the
Council unless the changes to said amended plan are judged by the Zoning
Administrator to be minor in nature or unless the changes have the effect of
surpassing City standards, such as larger setbacks or enhanced building
design.  In such cases, the amendment may be administratively approved by
City Administrator.



      C.   The petitioner may, as part of the final site plan
approval, be required to install public utilities, including (but not limited
to) water lines, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, street paving, fire hydrants,
and such other utilities as applicable to properly serve the proposed plan. 
Where required as part of a site plan approval, utilities shall be
constructed in accordance with City construction standards as referred to in
the subdivisions ordinance for those portions within the public right-of-way
and to be dedicated to the City, and may be required to be constructed to the
same specifications for those undedicated portions where said utilities may
have a direct effect on the future safety, proper functioning, and
maintenance of those portions to be dedicated.



(Ord. 13-15 – Feb. 14 Supp.)




      D.   Once a site plan is approved, the petitioner has eighteen
(18) months to apply for permits and commence the development of the property
consistent with the approved site plan and any related conditions and
agreements.  The development of the property shall be substantially
completed within thirty six (36) months from the date of City approval of the
site plan.  In the event that the petitioner fails to either commence or
complete the development of the property within these timeframes,
authorization to proceed with the development shall cease, and the petitioner
shall be required to seek reauthorization and approval of the site plan. 
The petitioner may, however, request an extension of time from the City.  If
an extension is granted, it may be conditioned upon updating any security
posted by the petitioner or requiring the petitioner to provide security to
reflect cost increases and extended completion date.

structurally altered shall be occupied or used in whole or in part, for any
purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by the Code Official
stating that the building and use comply with the provisions of this code and
the building and health ordinances of the City.  No change of use shall be
made in any building or part thereof, now or hereafter erected or
structurally altered, without the issuance of a permit therefor by the Code
Official.  No permit shall be issued to make a change unless the changes are
in conformity with the provisions of this code.  Nothing in this code shall
prevent the continuance of a legally established nonconforming use, unless
discontinuance is necessary for the safety of life or property. 
Certificates for occupancy and compliance shall be applied for coincidentally
with the application for a building permit and shall be approved for final
inspection within ten (10) days after the lawful erection or alteration of

165.10  USES NOT LISTED.  



   In the event any use is not listed in a specific district use table
within this ordinance, the use is considered not permitted in North Liberty
in that district. Upon request, the Zoning Administrator may consider the
following characteristics and reach a determination that such a use is
permitted in that or any other district, or determine that the use is not
similar to other uses and therefore not permitted in that or any other
district:



   1.   Characteristics or specific requirements of the use and how
those compare with characteristics and requirements of listed uses within the
zoning districts;



   2.   Potential impacts of the use on potential neighboring uses and
the City in general; and



   3.   Consequences of determining that the use is allowed in one or
more district.



   If a determination is made that the use is not permitted in a specific
district, the Zoning Administrator shall notify any applicant for said use in
writing, citing the reasons for that determination. An applicant so notified
may appeal the decision to the Board of Adjustment.

employee because such act or omission performed by the Code Official or
employee in the enforcement of any provision of this code or other pertinent
laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code or
enforced by the enforcement agency shall be defended by the City until final
termination of such proceedings, and any judgment resulting therefrom shall
be assumed by the City.  This code shall not be construed to relieve from or
lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating, or controlling any
building or parcel of land for any damages to persons or property caused by
defects, nor shall the enforcement agency or the City be held as assuming any
such liability by reason of the reviews or permits issued under this code.

cooperation of other officials of the City.



   9.   Applicant Standing.

the processes and standards set forth in this chapter.  However, the City
Administrator has the authority to place any application, including (but not
limited to) a rezoning application, a conditional use application, or a site
plan application, on hold indefinitely or to withdraw any permit at any stage
in the respective process by providing written notice of the same by regular
mail, in the event the applicant has not fulfilled any significant
obligations to the City with respect to current or previous development
activities within the City.  For the purposes of this section,
“development activities” include activities and actions related to
preliminary plats, construction plans, developer’s agreements, final plats,
and site plans.



      B.   For the purposes of this section, “applicant” means
any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, limited
liability company, or any other business entity or proprietor of land.  Any
individual person or business entity with a 5% interest or more in the
ownership or development of any particular property, whether previously
approved or currently proposed, is an “applicant” for the purpose of
enforcement of this section.



      C.   In the event the City Administrator exercises the
discretion and authority set forth in this section by placing an application
on hold or withdrawing a permit, any applicant may appeal that decision to
the Council within 10 days of the date of the notice.  The Council shall
hear and decide the appeal of the City Administrator’s decision within 30
days after the applicant provides written notice of appeal to the City
Administrator.  If the Council decides the appeal in favor of the applicant,
the City Administrator shall immediately lift the administrative hold and
ensure that the application is processed or the permit is reissued in
accordance with the City’s ordinances, processes, and procedures.

166.03  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



   1.   General.  This section addresses the duties and
responsibilities of a Board of Adjustment, hereafter referred to as the

shall be in accordance with the procedures and policies set forth in State
law.  The Board shall consist of five members.  All members of the Board

(Ord. 12-04 - Aug. 12 Supp.)

   7.   Duties and Powers.



      A.   Errors.  The Board shall have the power to hear and
decide on appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision, determination, or interpretation by the Code Official.



      B.   Variances.  The Board shall have the power to hear and
decide on appeals wherein a variance to the terms of this code is proposed. 
Limitations as to the Board’s authorization shall be as set forth in this
code.



      C.   Conditional Uses.  The Board shall review and act upon a
conditional use application based on the criteria established in Section
171.02 of this code and in conformance with the applicable regulations in
this Zoning Code.



      D.   Decisions.  The Zoning Ordinance is a document that lays
out very specific requirements deemed to be in the best interest of the City
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council.  In most cases, those
requirements must be met by property owners and developers; however, in some
rare cases the enforcement of those requirements may be found to cause
extreme hardship for an individual, and a variance may be granted. 
Variances shall not be granted by the Board simply because no one objects, or
because it seems harmless in an isolated circumstance.  Any variance granted
shall reflect the spirit and intent of the code and shall not constitute the
granting of a special privilege.  The following variance criteria shall be
utilized by the Board in hearing variance requests.  No variance shall be
granted by the Board unless affirmative findings can be made for each of the
applicable following criteria:



         (1)   Unique Circumstances.  The subject property is
unique or exceptional as compared to other properties subject to the same
provisions by reason of:



            (a)   Irregularity,



            (b)   Narrowness,



            (c)   Shallowness,



            (d)   Substandard or marginal size;



            (e)   Exceptional topographical features; or



            (f)   Other extraordinary conditions peculiar to
and inherent in the subject property and that relate to or arise out of the
property rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the
property, and that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner.



         (2)   Not Exclusively for Financial Gain.  The purpose
of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase financial
gain from the property.  Proof that the property cannot be used for its
highest or best use under the regulations applicable to it – or that it
could be used more profitably if not subject to such regulations – should
not in itself justify granting a variance.



         (3)   Hardship Not Self-Created.  The unique or special
condition referenced in subsection (1) above existed at the time of the
enactment of the provisions of this code that affect it, or was the result of
government action (other than adoption of the Zoning Ordinance) for which no
compensation was paid, and has not been created by any persons presently
having an interest in the property.



         (4)   Substantial Rights Denied.  Carrying out the
strict letter of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the
property owner of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by other property
owners subject to the same provisions.



         (5)   Not Special Privilege.  The hardship affecting
the property is not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy
some special privilege or additional right not available to owners or
occupants of other property subject to the same provisions.



         (6)   Not Detrimental.  Granting the variance will not
be detrimental to the public welfare or materially injurious to the
enjoyment, use, or development of property in the vicinity; would not
materially impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent properties;
would not substantially increase congestion in the public streets, or
increase the danger of flood or fire, or endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values in the vicinity.



         (7)   No Other Remedy.  There is no means other than
the requested variance by which the hardship can be avoided or remedied to a
degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the property.



   Written findings citing each of these criteria shall be made for each
case to document the process and decision of the Board.



166.04  VIOLATIONS.



   It is unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, alter,
repair, move, improve, remove, convert or demolish, equip, use, occupy, or
maintain any building or land or cause or permit the same to be done in
violation of this code.  When any building or parcel of land regulated by
this code is being used contrary to this code, the Code Official may order
such use discontinued and the structure, parcel of land, or portion thereof,
vacated by notice served on any person causing such use to be continued. 
Such person shall discontinue the use within the time prescribed by the Code
Official after receipt of such notice to make the structure, parcel of land,
or portions thereof, comply with the requirements of this code.



166.05  LICENSING.



   1.   General.  All departments, officials, and employees charged
with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall issue no permit
or license for uses or purposes where the same would be in conflict with this
code.  Any permit or license, if issued in conflict with this code, shall be
null and void.



   2.   Expiration or Cancellation.  Each license, permit, or approval
issued shall expire after 180 days if no work is undertaken or such use or
activity is not established, unless a different time of issuance of the
license or permit is allowed in this code, or unless an extension is granted
by the issuing agency prior to expiration.



   3.   Failure to Comply.  Failure to comply with the terms of any
permit, license, or approval may be grounds for cancellation or revocation. 
Action to cancel any license, permit, or approval may be taken on proper
grounds by the Code Official.  Cancellation of a permit or approval by the
Commission or Board may be appealed in the same manner as its original action.



   4.   Validity of Licenses, Permits, and Approvals.  For the
issuance of any license, permit, or approval for which the Commission or
Board is responsible, the Code Official shall require that the development or
use in question proceed only in accordance with the terms of such license,
permit, or approval, including any requirements or conditions established as
a condition of issuance.  Except as specifically provided for in this code
and conditions of approval, the securing of one required review or approval
shall not exempt the recipient from the necessity of securing any other
required review or approval.



166.06  PENALTIES.



   The owner or agent of a building or premises in or upon which a
violation of any provision of this code has been committed or shall exist, or
the lessee or tenant of an entire building or entire premises in or upon
which violation has been committed or shall exist, or the agent, architect,
building contractor, or any other person who commits, takes part in, or
assists in any violation or who maintains any building or premises in or upon
which such violation shall exist, or who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects,
or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of any of the
provisions of this code shall be subject, upon conviction, to the provisions
of Section 1.14 of this Code of Ordinances.  Each day that a violation is
permitted to exist after proper notice shall constitute a separate offense.

168.06  C ZONES – COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.



   1.   Defined.  Allowable C Zone uses are:



      A.   C-1-A Central Commercial District.  The C-1-A Central
Commercial District is intended to provide a traditional central setting
oriented toward pedestrians as well as automobiles.  It is typified by
high-density commercial development with minimal setback requirements. 
Residential development is excluded except where located above a commercial
unit.



      B.   C-1-B General Commercial District.  The C-1-B General
Commercial District is intended to provide for the uses established under the
C-1-A Central Commercial District and other commercial uses which due to
space requirements and the nature of operations are not suitable for location
within a compact central commercial center.  Setback and yard requirements
are greater than under the C-1-A Central Commercial District.



      C.   C-2-A Highway Commercial District.  The C-2-A Highway
Commercial District is intended to provide for those commercial uses which
may take particular advantage of a highway location and/or due to size or
other nuisance constraints may be incompatible with the predominantly retail
uses permitted in the C-1-A and C-1-B Commercial Districts, and whose service
area is not confined to any one neighborhood or community.



      D.   C-2-B Highway Commercial District.  The C-2-B Highway
Commercial District is intended to provide for those commercial uses which
may take advantage of a highway location and are compatible with second story
residential uses.  This district will be used sparingly after initial
passage of the City zoning map.



      E.   C-3 Concept Commercial District. The C-3 Concept
Commercial District is intended to accommodate office, commercial, medical
and associated uses in an environment of high-quality pedestrian-oriented
design with uses limited to those typically found in destination areas
offering services and uses to local and regional residents. C-3 districts are
anticipated to be located on or near major streets and to be made up of large
or multiple lots that can be developed with an overall concept anticipated to
be controlled through the use of a Planned Area Development (PAD) overlay
district. Design, construction materials, lighting, landscaping, paving, and
other characteristics will be designed to create a sense of place and
memorable environment. Businesses that emit offensive odors, fumes, dust or
loud noise are generally disallowed in this district.




(Ord. 10-14 - June 12 Supp.)




   2.   Use Regulations.  Principal and accessory uses permitted in

      C-3 - Table 168.06-E




(Ord. 10-14 - June 12 Supp.)




   3.   Bulk Regulations.  The minimum area, setback, density and
maximum height restrictions shall be as prescribed in Table 168.06-F.



   4.   Accessory Uses.  Accessory uses are permitted subject to the
provisions of Section 169.06.

168.11  OFP ZONE – FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.



   1.   Definitions.  Unless specifically defined below, words or
phrases used in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the
meaning they have in common usage and to give this section its most
reasonable application.



      “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.  (See 100-year flood).



      “Basement” means any enclosed area of a building which has
its floor or lowest level below ground level (subgrade) on all sides.  Also
see “lowest floor.”



      “Development” means any manmade change to improved or
unimproved real estate, including (but not limited to) buildings or other
structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or
drilling operations.



      “Existing construction” means any structure for which the
“start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map.  (May also be referred to as
“existing structure.”)



      “Existing factory-built home park or subdivision” means a
factory-built home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the factory-built homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) was completed before the effective date of these flood plain
management regulations.



      “Expansion of existing factory-built home park or
subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction
of facilities for servicing the lots on which the factory-built homes are to
be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads.)



      “Factory-built home” means any structure designed for
residential use which is, wholly or in substantial part, made, fabricated,
formed, or assembled in manufacturing facilities for installation – or
assembly and installation – on a building site.  For the purpose of this
section, factory-built homes include mobile homes, manufactured homes, and
modular homes and also include “recreational vehicles” which are placed
on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days and not fully licensed for
and ready for highway use.



      “Factory-built home park” means a parcel or contiguous
parcels of land divided into two or more factory-built home lots for sale or
lease.



      “Flood” means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas resulting from the overflow of
streams or rivers or from the unusual and rapid runoff of surface waters from
any source.



      “Flood elevation” means the elevation floodwaters would reach
at a particular site during the occurrence of a specific flood.  For
instance, the 100-year flood elevation is the elevation of floodwaters
related to the occurrence of the 100-year flood.



      “Flood insurance rate map” (FIRM) means the official map
prepared as part of (but published separately from) the Flood Insurance Study
which delineates both the flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.



      “Flood plain” means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water as a result of a flood.



      “Flood plain management” means an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damages and promoting
the wise use of flood plains, including (but not limited to) emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, flood proofing and flood plain
management regulations.



      “Flood proofing” means any combination of structural and
nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, including
utility and sanitary facilities, which will reduce or eliminate flood damage
to such structures.



      “Floodway” means the channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the flood plain adjoining the channel which are reasonably
required to carry and discharge floodwaters or flood flows so that
confinement of flood flows to the floodway area will not cumulatively
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot.



      “Floodway fringe” means those portions of the flood plain,
other than the floodway, which can be filled, leveed, or otherwise obstructed
without causing substantially higher flood levels or flow velocities.



“Historic structure” means any structure that is:



         (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of
Historic Places, maintained by the Department of Interior, or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing of the National Register;



         (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the
Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a
registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;



         (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of
historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been
approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or



         (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of
historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have
been certified by either (i) an approved state program as determined by the
Secretary of the Interior or (ii) directly by the Secretary of the Interior
in states without approved programs.



      “Lowest floor” means the floor of the lowest enclosed area in
a building including a basement except when all the following criteria are
met:



         (1)   The enclosed area is designed to flood to equalize
hydrostatic pressure during floods with walls or openings that satisfy the
provisions of subsection (11)(B)(4)(a) of this section; and



         (2)   The enclosed area is unfinished (not carpeted,
dry-walled, etc.) and used solely for low damage potential uses such as
building access, parking or storage; and



         (3)   Machinery and service facilities (e.g., hot water
heater, furnace, electrical service) contained in the enclosed area are
located at least one foot above the 100-year flood level; and



         (4)   The enclosed area is not a “basement” as
defined in this section.



   In cases where the lowest enclosed area satisfies criteria (1), (2),
(3) and (4) above, the lowest floor is the floor of the next highest enclosed
area that does not satisfy the criteria above.



      “New construction” (new buildings, factory-built home parks)
means those structures or development for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of the Flood Insurance Rate Map.



      “New factory-built home park or subdivision” means a
factory-built home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the factory-built homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of these flood
plain management regulations.



      “100-year flood” means a flood, the magnitude of which has a
one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, or which,
on the average, will be equaled or exceeded a least once every 100 years.



      “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:



         (1)   Built on a single chassis;



         (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when
measured at the largest horizontal projection;



         (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently
towable by a light duty truck; and



         (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel,
or seasonal use.



      “Special flood hazard area” means the land within a community
subject to the 100-year flood.  This land is identified as Zone A on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map.



      “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and
means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start
of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement,
or other improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date.  The actual
start means either the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation
of pile, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. 
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds
riot occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building.



      “Structure” means anything constructed or erected on the
ground or attached to the ground, including (but not limited to) buildings,
factories, sheds, cabins, factor-built homes, storage tanks, and other
similar uses.



      “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by
a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damage
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.



      “Substantial improvement” means any improvement to a
structure which satisfies either of the following criteria:



         (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure, either:  (i) before the “start of construction” of the
improvement; or (ii) if the structure has been “substantially damaged”
and is being restored, before the damage occurred.  The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe conditions for the existing use.  The
term also does not include any alteration of an “historic structure,”
provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s designation as an
“historic structure.”



         (2)   Any addition which increases the original floor
area of a building by 25 percent or more.  All additions constructed after
February 16, 2007, shall be added to any proposed addition in determining
whether the total increase in original floor space would exceed 25 percent.



      “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the
terms of the flood plain management regulations.



      “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other
development to be fully compliant with this section.



   2.   Lands to Which Section Applies.  The provisions of this
section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on
the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the
Floodway, Floodway Fringe, General Flood Plain and Shallow Flooding Overlay
Districts, as established subsection 9 of this section.



   3.   Establishment of Official Flood Plain Zoning Overlay Map.  The
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Panels 045, 065, 160, and 180, prepared as
part of the Flood Insurance Study for the City, dated February 16, 2007, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Flood Plain
Zoning Map.  The flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with
the Flood Insurance Study are also declared to be a part of this section.



   4.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries.  The
boundaries of the zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Flood Plain Zoning Overlay Map.  When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the City
Engineer shall make the necessary interpretation.  The Board of Adjustment
shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in
any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Code Official in the
enforcement or administration of this section.



   5.   Compliance.  No structure or land shall hereafter be used and
no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this section.



   6.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  It is not intended by
this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this section imposes
greater restrictions, the provision of this section shall prevail.  All
other ordinances inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.



   7.   Interpretation.  In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the Council and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.



   8.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The standards required
by this section are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes.  This
section does not imply that areas outside the designated Flood Plain Overlay
District areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This section
shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.



   9.   Establishment of Zoning Overlay Districts.  The flood plain
areas within the jurisdiction of this section are hereby divided into the
following districts:  Floodway District (FW), Floodway Fringe District (FF),
General Flood Plain District (FP), and Shallow Flooding District (SF).  The
boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map.  Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses or permissible as
conditional uses are prohibited unless a variance to the terms of this
section is granted after due consideration by the Board of Adjustment.



   10.   Floodway Overlay District (FW).



      A.   Permitted Uses.  The following uses are permitted within
the Floodway District to the extent they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance (or underlying zoning district) and provided they do not include
placement of structures, factory-built homes, fill or other obstruction, the
storage of material or equipment, excavation, or alteration of a watercourse.



         (1)   Agricultural uses such as general farming,
pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck
farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.



         (2)   Industrial-commercial uses such as loading areas,
parking areas, airport landing strips.



         (3)   Private and public recreational uses such as golf
courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat
launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game
farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet
ranges, hinting and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding trails.



         (4)   Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking
areas, and play areas.



         (5)   Such other open-space uses similar in nature to
the above uses.



      B.   Conditional Uses.  The following uses which involve
structures (temporary or permanent), fill, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse may be permitted only upon issuance
of a Conditional Use Permit by the Board of Adjustment as provided for in
subsection 16 of this section.  Such uses must also meet the applicable
provisions of the Floodway District Performance Standards.

   16.   Conditional Uses, Appeals and Variances.



      A.   Duties of Board of Adjustment.  A Board of Adjustment
shall hear and decide:  (i) applications for conditional uses upon which the
Board is authorized to pass under this section; (ii) appeals; and (iii)
requests for variances to the provisions of this section, and shall take any
other action which is required of the Board.



      B.   Conditional Uses.  Requests for conditional uses shall
be submitted to the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of
Adjustment for consideration.  Such requests shall include information
ordinarily submitted with applications as well as any additional information
deemed necessary to the Board of Adjustment.



      C.   Appeals.  Where it is alleged there is any error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of this section, the aggrieved party may appeal
such action.  The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of
Adjustment and with the official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set
forth the specific reason for the appeal.  The official from whom the appeal
is taken shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the documents
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.



      D.   Variance.  The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon
request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this section that
will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this section will
result in unnecessary hardship.  Variances granted must meet the following
applicable standards.



         (1)   Variances shall only be granted upon:  (i) a
showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(iii) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.



         (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood
would result.  Consideration of the effects of any development on flood
levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development
would be allowed for similarly situated lands.



         (3)   Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.



         (4)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
section, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that:  (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00
of insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.



         (5)   All variances granted shall have the concurrence
or approval of the Department of Natural Resources.



      E.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.

for a Variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing.  The Board shall fix
a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as
due notice to parties in interest.  At the hearing, any party may appear in
person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence.  The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as
is reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance
and/or evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or
agency, including the Department of Natural Resources.



         (2)   Decisions.  The Board shall arrive at a decision
on an appeal, conditional use, or variance within a reasonable time.  In
passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in
conformity with the provisions of this section, reverse or affirm, wholly or
in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.  In granting a
conditional use or variance, the Board shall consider such factors as
contained in this subsection and all other relevant parts of this section and
may prescribe such conditions as contained in subsection 18 of this section.



   17.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment
Shall be Based.  In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall
consider all relevant factors specified in this section and:



      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments.



      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land
or downstream to the injury of others.



      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.



      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.



      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.



      F.   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain
location.



      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.



      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.



      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and flood plain management program for the area.



      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles.



      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.



      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
(sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.



      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of
this section.



   18.   Conditions Attached to Variances.  Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of
this section.  Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited
to:



      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply
facilities.



      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.



      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.

ditches, levees and other protective measures, provided such are approved by
the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical
alternative to achieving the purpose of this section.



      E.   Flood proofing measures shall be designed consistent with
the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities,
durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other
factors associated with the regulatory flood.  The Board of Adjustment shall
require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer that the flood proofing measures are
consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated
flood factors for the particular area.



   19.   Appeals to the Court.  Any person or persons, jointly or

168.12  PAD ZONE – PLANNED AREA DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT.



   1.   Defined.  A Planned Area Development Zone District is intended
to encourage innovation and flexibility in planning the development of land
so development is compatible with the site’s physical and environmental
characteristics.  This district allows for flexibility in zone district
requirements.  The Planned Area Development District provides an opportunity
for the development of a mixture of uses and housing types in a coordinated
manner.  The intent of the underlying zone district shall guide the
development.  It is incumbent upon the person proposing the PAD to justify
the project, and any variations from the underlying zone district.  A PAD is
considered an amendment to the underlying zone district regulations. 
Section 165.04(2) specifies the PAD requirements.



   2.   General.  Planned area developments may be allowed by Council
approval in any zoning district.  No such planned area development permit
shall be granted unless such development either meets the use limitations of
the zoning district in which it is located and the density and other
limitations of such district, except as such requirements may be lawfully
modified as provided by this code.  Compliance with the regulations of this
section in no way excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of a
subdivision ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically
authorized in the approval of the application for the planned area
development.



   3.   Conditions.



      A.   Area.  No planned area development shall have area less
than that approved by the Council as adequate for the proposed development.



      B.   Uses.  A planned area development that will contain uses
not permitted in the zoning district in which it is to be located will
require a change of zoning and shall be accompanied by an application for a
zoning amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a
permitted use and shall be governed by density, design and other requirements
of the planned area development permit.



      C.   Ownership.  The development shall be in single or
corporate ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an
application filed jointly by all owners of the property.

arrangements of structures and open spaces within the site development plan
as necessary to ensure that adjacent properties will not be adversely
affected.



         (1)   Density.  Density of land use shall in no case be
more than 25 percent higher than allowed in the zoning district, except not
more than 10 percent higher in residential districts.



         (2)   Arrangement.  Where feasible, the least height
and density of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of
the development.



         (3)   Specific Regulations.  Lot area, width, yard,
height, density, and coverage regulations shall be determined by approval of
the site plan.



      E.   Open Spaces.  Preservation, maintenance, and ownership
of required open spaces within the development shall be accomplished by
either:



         (1)   Dedication of land as a public park or parkway
system, or

maintenance being the responsibility of an owners’ association established
with articles of association and bylaws which are satisfactory to the Council.



      F.   Landscaping.  Landscaping, fencing, and screening
related to the uses within the site and as means of integrating the proposed
development into its surroundings shall be planned and presented to the
Commission and Council for approval, together with other required plans for
the development.  A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery
plantings shall be prepared for the entire site to be developed.  A grading
and drainage plan shall also be submitted to the Commission and Council with
the application.



      G.   Signs.  The size, location, design, and nature of signs,
if any, and the intensity and direction of floodlighting shall be detailed in

location shall be shown, as necessary or desirable, to provide a service or
facility which will contribute to the general well-being of the surrounding
area.  It shall also be shown that under the circumstances of the particular
case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or
general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the planned area
development.



   4.   Commission and Council Determination.  In carrying out the
intent of this section, the Commission and Council shall consider the
following principles:



      A.   It is the intent of this section that site and building
plans for a planned area development shall be prepared by a designer or team
of designers having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in
the application.  The Commission and Council may require the applicant to
engage such expertise as a qualified designer or designer team.



      B.   The Council may approve or disapprove an application for
a planned area development.  In approval, the Council may attach such

specifications approved by the Council, and in conformity with any conditions
attached by the jurisdiction as to its approval.



         (2)   Amendment to approved plans and specifications to
a planned area development shall be obtained only by following procedures
here outlined for first approval.



         (3)   The Code Official shall not issue any permit for
any proposed building, structure or use within the project unless such
building, structure, or use is in accordance with the approved development
plan and any conditions imposed in conjunction with its approval.

      D.   All planting shall be maintained in good growing
condition.  Such maintenance shall include, where appropriate, pruning,
mowing, weeding, fertilizing, and regular watering.  Whenever necessary,
planting shall be replaced with other plant material to ensure continued
compliance with applicable landscaping requirements.



      E.   Landscaping shall not be located where it will block
visibility and create traffic hazards or sight distance problems.



      F.   Landscaping shall be used in conjunction with required
fencing as buffer between land uses where possible.



      G.   Plants which drop seed pods or fruit should not be
located where such droppings would cause maintenance or safety problems.



   Approval of landscaping in place is to be requested by the developer at
the time an occupancy permit is requested.  Any changes or deviation from
the approved site plan landscape design shall be approved by the City
Administrator prior to installation.  Landscaping must be completed by
October 15 to be considered for approval during a calendar year. 
Landscaping materials shall be planted as each phase of a site is
developed.  Should completion of landscaping be delayed because of seasonal
weather, a temporary occupancy permit may be issued if the developer posts a
bond in the amount of the landscaping to be completed.  At the developer’s
option and at the time of site plan filing, the developer may submit a list
of alternate or substitute species from the permitted or established list to
be used should the preferred material not be available when needed and
required.



   2.   Maintenance.  All landscaping required by this code shall be
properly maintained.  All dead or dying landscaping shall be replaced
immediately and all sodded areas mowed, fertilized, and irrigated on a
regular basis.



169.03  GRADING AND EXCAVATION REGULATIONS.



   This section is intended to provide the community with fair and
equitable grading practices and is not meant to supersede the requirements of
any other ordinance or code.



   1.   Protection of Utilities.  The developer shall be responsible
for the prevention of damage to any public utilities or service.



   2.   Protection of Adjacent Property.  The person doing or causing
grading or excavation is responsible for the prevention of damage to adjacent
property.  No person shall grade or excavate on land to endanger any
adjoining public street, sidewalk, alley, or other public or private
property, without supporting and protecting such property from any damage
that might result from the grading or excavation.



   3.   Inspection Notice.  The developer shall notify the Inspection
Department at least 24 hours prior to start of work.



   4.   Temporary Erosion Control.  The developer shall put into
effect and maintain all precautionary measures necessary to protect adjacent
watercourses and public or private property from damage by water erosion,
flooding, or deposition of mud or debris originating from the site. 
Precautionary measures must include provisions of properly designed sediment
control facilities so that downstream properties are not affected by upstream
erosion, or upstream properties are not flooded by blockage of downstream
drainage.



   5.   Traffic Control and Protection of Streets.  The developer
shall provide flag persons, signs, barricades, and other safety devices to
ensure adequate safety when working in or near public streets.



   6.   Hazard from Existing Grading.  Whenever any existing
excavation, embankment, or fill has become a hazard to life or limb or
endangers structures, or adversely affects the safety, use, or stability of a
public way or drainage channel, the owner of the property upon which the
excavation, embankment, or fill is located or the person or agent in control
of said property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the City, shall,
within the period specified therein, repair, reconstruct, or remove such
excavation, embankment, or fill to eliminate the hazard.



169.04  TRASH AND RECYCLING ENCLOSURE.



   Trash and recycling enclosures are required for commercial, industrial,
and multi-family zoned areas except that side-by-side, or townhouse-style
multi-family developments may be approved for curb-side individual pickup by
Council resolution upon recommendation by the Building Official that the
developer or owner has demonstrated the following:



   1.   Adequate maneuverability for garbage truck access; and



   2.   Practical and adequate frontage for each dwelling unit so that
placement of garbage and recycle materials does not impede pedestrians or
drivers on public or private sidewalks, driveways, or streets.



   If curb-side pickup is approved, the developer shall provide a recorded
document releasing the City from any and all damage or injury liability
arising from garbage collection activities, and notifying future owners of
that release.  Enclosures shall not be located in the front yard area and
should be located out of public view to the greatest degree possible. 
Openings shall be oriented so that gates do not open toward public streets
whenever practical. Enclosures shall be constructed of decorative block or
brick to match the principle building to the maximum extent possible, to
minimize its visual impact.  Gates shall be constructed with
commercial-grade hinges, pulls, and hasps, and gate supports shall be metal
with an appropriate diameter to support the gates.  The gates themselves
shall be constructed to present a decorative solid façade.  Class 2B fused
and bonded vinyl coated gauge chain link fence panels with minimum 9 gauge
core, with 2" mesh, and winged type slats installed to obtain a Privacy
factor of 90% or greater may be used as a substitute for a solid façade.
Protective bollards should be provided.  See Figure 6 for access
requirements for multi-family uses.

submitted prior to the installation or alteration of a fence.  The
application shall be accompanied by a plot plan, in duplicate, drawn to
scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot; the size, shape, and
location of all existing buildings; location, height, and material type of
the proposed fence; and such other information as may be necessary to provide
for the enforcement of this section.  A record of applications and plans
shall be kept in the Code Official's office.

is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced, for a
period of 180 days.  Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall
be first obtained to do so.  In order to renew action on a permit after
expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.  Any permittee
holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within
which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is unable to
commence work within the time required by this section for good and
satisfactory reasons.  The Code Official may extend the time for action by
the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days on written request by the
permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have
prevented action from being taken.  No permit shall be extended more than
once.

169.07  SUPPLEMENTAL LOT REGULATIONS.



   1.   Zoning Lot.  In this chapter the term “lot” refers to a
“zoning lot” unless the context clearly indicates that it refers instead
to a “lot of record.”  A zoning lot is a single tract of contiguous land
which, at the time of filing for a building permit or a certificate of
occupancy or district boundary change, is designated by the owner or
developer as a tract to be used, developed, or built upon as a unit under
single or unified ownership or control and assigned to the particular use,
building, or structure for which the building permit or certificate of
occupancy is issued.  A lot includes such area of land as may be required by
the provisions of this chapter for such use, building, or structure.



   2.   Lot Street Frontage and Access Required.  No lot shall be
created or any principal building constructed or placed on any lot or tract
of land unless such lot or tract has frontage on either a public street or on
a private street which has been specifically approved by the Council for that
purpose.  In order to be approved, such street shall provide permanent and
unobstructed vehicular access, have a roadway of adequate width and surface,
and meet all other applicable standards and requirements, established by the
City.  No lot shall be used for residential purposes unless such lot has at
least a 35-foot frontage on such street.



   3.   Division of Lot.  No improved lot shall hereafter be divided
into two or more lots and no portion of any improved lot shall be sold unless
all lots resulting from each division or sale shall conform to all the
applicable bulk regulations of the district in which the property is located.



   4.   Number of Principal Buildings Permitted on a Lot.  In all RM,
C, and I districts, more than one principal institutional public or
semi-public, multi-family, commercial, or industrial building may be located
on a lot provided that no such building or portion thereof is located outside
the buildable area of the lot.  However, in all RS and RD districts, except
in the case of Planned Area Developments, not more than one detached one- or
two-family residential building shall be located on the same lot with any
other principal building.



   5.   Lot of Record.  In any residence district on a lot of record,
on the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, a single-family dwelling may
be established even though the lot area and width do not meet the minimum
district requirements, provided all other requirements of this code are
met.  However, where two or more contiguous substandard recorded lots are in
common ownership and are of such size that together they constitute at least
one conforming “zoning lot,” such lots or portions thereof shall be so
joined and re-platted for the purpose of forming an effective and conforming
zoning lot or lots.



169.08  SUPPLEMENTAL YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.



   Any building, structure, or use hereafter erected, altered, or
established shall comply with the general yard space requirements of the
district within which it is located, except as specified herein. Reference
the "Yards Exhibit" for visual representation of yard areas.



   1.   Location of Required Yard.  The required yard space for any
building, structure, or use shall be contained on the same lot as the
building, structure, or use and such required yard space shall be entirely
upon land in a district in which the principal use is permitted. 



   2.   Reduction or Sharing of Required Yards or Space Prohibited. 
No lot, yard, court, parking area, or other space shall be reduced in area or
dimension so as to make said area or dimension less than the minimum required
for this code.  No part of a yard, court, parking area, or other space
provided for any building or structure to comply with the provisions of this
code shall be included as part of a yard, court, parking area, or other
spaces required under this code for another building or structure.



   3.   Required Yards for Existing Buildings.  No yards, now or
hereafter provided, for a building existing on the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance shall subsequently be reduced below (or further reduced if
already less than) the minimum yard requirements of this code for equivalent
new construction.



   4.   Required Yards on Major Streets.



      A.   Major Streets.  All applicable building setbacks and
yard requirements set forth in this code shall be measured and determined
from the existing street right-of-way.



      B.   Private Streets.  All applicable building setbacks and
yard requirements along private streets shall be measured from the nearest
line of the access easement.



      C.   In all C, O-RP, and I-1 districts on lots fronting on two
nonintersecting streets, a front yard must be provided on both streets.



      D.   On corner lots in all districts there shall be a front
yard on both streets.



   5.   Transitional Yards.  Where a lot is in a C or I-1 district and
is next to an R district, the side or rear yard required in that R district
must be provided along the boundary line.



   6.   Yards with More than One Principal Building.  When two or more
buildings are permitted on a lot, the required yards shall be maintained
around the group of buildings.



   7.   RD Side Yards.  In all RD two-family dwelling unit districts,
only the side yard on the detached side of the dwelling will be required. 
No side yard will be required on the side of the dwelling located on the
common lot line.



   8.   Permitted Encroachments in Required Yards.  Under the terms of
this code a required yard shall be open, unoccupied, and unobstructed from
grade to the sky except for permitted encroachments.  The following
exceptions identify such permitted encroachments and in which yards they are

and objects mounted on a pole or pedestal shall use a narrow cone of light
that does not extend beyond the illuminated object.



         (5)   Illumination shall not exceed one foot-candle at
property boundaries of multi-family, commercial, and industrial uses adjacent
to or across the street from a residential zone, or a commercial zone in
which residential uses are permitted.



         (6)   Outdoor recreational facilities permitted by
conditional use may be exempt from the specific exterior lighting standards,
provided the Board of Adjustment approves a lighting plan as part of the
conditional use approval process.  Outdoor sports fields and courts operated
by the City or by a school district are exempt from the specific illumination
requirements in this section, subject to approval by the City Council after
review and recommendation of the Planning Commission, of a lighting plan that
minimizes light impacts on adjacent property to the maximum extent
technologically possible, and meets the following minimum requirements:



            (a)   Use of the lighting is restricted to those
hours when the recreational facility is in use, and lighting for said
facilities shall be turned off by one hour after conclusion of the
recreational activity.  For facilities located in or adjacent to residential
zones, lighting for said facilities shall be permitted after eleven o'clock
P. M. only to  conclude a scheduled event that was unable to conclude before
that time due to unusual circumstances; and

foot-candle at the closest part of any principle structure on any adjacent
lot.  If no principle structure exists on adjacent platted lots,
illumination shall not exceed one foot-candle at a distance of eight-five
feet from the front lot line of the adjacent lot, so that illumination does
not exceed one foot-candle at the closest part of a future principle
structure on a lot with a 25 foot setback and a 60 foot deep principle
structure; and



            (c)   All lights greater than 2,000 lumens, both
pole-mounted and wall-mounted, shall be equipped with cutoff shields, so that
no light shines above the horizontal and no direct light falls beyond the
closest part of any principle structure on any adjacent lot.  If no
principle structure exists on adjacent platted lots, illumination shall not
fall beyond a distance of eight-five feet from the front lot line of the
adjacent lot, so that illumination does not fall at the closest part of a
future principle structure on a lot with a 25 foot setback and a 60 foot deep
principle structure.

      E.   Building elevations shall include the use of windows,
wall breaks, siding changes, extra wall corners, dormers, and other
architectural features to create visually attractive buildings that
compliment single-family development in the City.



   4.   Requirements for Development in Office and Commercial Zoning
Districts.



      A.   Commercial zoning districts are intended to enhance
public welfare by providing for safe, convenient, high quality
pedestrian-oriented commercial centers that contribute to community identity
as energetic and attractive focus points. Through development and
redevelopment within these districts, the city recognizes the importance of
creating high quality development areas to the quality of life for residents
of the city, the impact quality development has on the image of the
community, and the need to provide restrictions and guidelines to enhance
visual appearance and functionality. The objectives addressed through these
regulations include the following:



         (1)   Design. To achieve appealing aesthetic design
through high quality architecture and construction, with attention to
placement, relationship, and orientation of structures and amenities to
provide both internal cohesiveness and compatibility with surrounding uses.



         (2)   Walkability. To achieve overall development
patterns that encourage walking and reduce dependence on the automobile to
travel from one business to another, and so reduces the dominance of the
automobile within the development.



         (3)   Human-scale Activity. To achieve a sense of place
by emphasizing pedestrian interaction with commercial uses rather than
sprawling automobile-dominated designs, both in building architecture and
public or private outdoor areas.



         (4)   Compatible Uses. To achieve the right blend of
uses, compact and well-designed, that complement each other and provide
cohesive overall developments.



      B.   In addition to requirements of subsection 1 of this
section, the following requirements shall be observed for development in the
office and commercial zoning districts:



         (1)   Site Layout Requirements.



            (a)   Pedestrian Areas. Each development shall
provide a complete network of paths, plazas, and open spaces that
interconnect building entrances, parking, sidewalks, other properties, and
other pedestrian amenities. These pedestrian areas are expected to constitute
a significant portion of development area, and may include plazas, special
paving areas between parking and entrances, and outdoor eating patios.
Additionally, portions of pedestrian areas should be at least partly covered
so that users are protected from rain and intense sun. New developments will
be required to connect to paths and sidewalks established by
previously-approved developments.



            (b)   Outdoor Infrastructure Design. Each
development shall provide outdoor lighting fixtures, integrated street pavers
or patterns, and landscaping that reinforces quality building design and
blends with previously-approved developments, when appropriate. Design
elements may include decorative lighting, seating with benches, low walls,
planters, enhanced paving techniques, and other features complimentary to the
development.



            (c)   Parking Areas. Parking areas shall consist
of areas that are aesthetically pleasing, landscaped to screen public views,
and located so as not to be the dominant feature along any street or within
any development. The use of alternate materials to designate pedestrian areas
within or adjacent to parking lots is encouraged, and pedestrian areas shall
be separated from vehicular traffic with landscaping, decorative posts,
special paving, or other measures to clearly define the pedestrian spaces.
Property owners are encouraged to establish shared parking zones among uses
on one or more lots.



         (2)   Building Materials and Design Requirements.



            (a)   Materials. Exterior vertical building
elevations in all commercial districts except for the C-3 district shall be
composed of at least 60% brick or other masonry products. Exterior vertical
building elevations in the C-3 district shall be composed of at least 90%
brick or other masonry products. Exterior walls not composed of masonry
products shall not be covered with ribbed metal siding commonly referred to
as corrugated metal. The required masonry area shall be based on a net wall
surface, defined as the total area between ground level and the soffit or
roof line, from farthest outside wall left to farthest outside wall right,
with window and door areas subtracted out.



            (b)   Design. Buildings and building features
shall be sized and detailed appropriately for pedestrian use. Projected or
recessed doorways and windows, awnings, and other architectural features may
be used to achieve this design. Traditional strip-retail type frontages
featuring long flat frontages with regularly spaced doors and unbroken
expanses of concrete approaching the storefronts are specifically
disallowed.  Side and rear elevations shall be comprised of the same
materials and reasonably similar in character and quality as the front
elevation unless screened from view from all public streets and residential
areas by topography differences, landscaping materials, or other screening
devices, in which case building material may be concrete block or tilt-up
concrete panels.

Industrial Development.  For each Commercial, Office Park, or Industrial
Development, one tree will be shown for every 2,000 square feet of building
footprint.



   5.   Screening of Nonresidential Uses.  A green belt planting strip
consisting of evergreen shrubs and trees shall be used to screen any
nonresidential use from adjoining residential districts or residential
uses.  Such planting strip shall be of sufficient width and density, as
determined by City staff, to provide an effective and aesthetically pleasing
screen with shrubs and trees not less than five feet in height when
planted.  In lieu of planting strips, a six-foot tall solid vertical fence
of masonry or heavy wood construction, or other similar material approved by
the City, may be used as a screen, provided that decorative plantings are
established on the residential side of the fence.  Both a green belt
planting strip and a six-foot tall fence may be required at the discretion of
City staff.



6.   Open Storage of Materials and Equipment.  Outside storage of
materials and equipment is permitted in certain commercial and industrial
districts subject to City staff approval of a site plan showing details of
the site and the storage area.  In those cases, a green belt planting strip
consisting of evergreen shrubs and trees shall be used to screen the storage
from view from all public ways and all neighboring properties.  Such
planting strip shall be of sufficient width and density as determined by City
staff to provide an effective and aesthetically pleasing screen with trees
and shrubs not less than five feet in height when planted.  In lieu of
planting strips, a six-foot tall solid vertical fence or masonry, heavy wood

be used as a screen.  All such open storage shall be allowed only on
hard-surface areas paved to parking lot specifications with asphalt or
concrete.



(Ord. 12-12 - Jan. 13 Supp.)



169.14  ENFORCEMENT OF DESIGN STANDARDS.



   1.   The Commission shall have the following authority related to
this section:



      A.   To recommend denial of any site plan that does not
conform to all regulations of this section, including elevation detail.



      B.   To recommend modifications to building materials,
architectural features, or orientation on the site, beyond those explicitly
enumerated in this section, considered to be consistent with the goals and
objectives of the City’s Comprehensive Plan.



   2.   The Council shall have the following authority related to this
section:



      A.   To deny any site plan that does not conform to all design
standards in this code, including elevation detail.



      B.   To require modifications to building materials,
architectural features, or orientation on the site beyond those requirements
explicitly enumerated in this section, considered to be consistent with the
goals and objectives of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, or to deny any site
plan if such modifications are not made by the petitioner.



169.15    RENTAL HOUSING UNIT OCCUPANCY LIMITS.




Cities' ability nationwide to control resident density has traditionally been
accomplished through limitations on the number of non-family members living
together, contemplated and utilized to address a traditional familial living
situation.  However, effective January 1, 2018, state law prohibits the use
of family definitions to control rental unit occupancy.  If left unaddressed
by this ordinance, that change would likely lead to fundamental negative
impacts to residential areas in the City caused by overpopulation of existing
units and uncontrolled density of persons in new units.  Potential impacts
include increased noise, increased traffic and parking congestion, and stress
on sanitary sewer and garbage collection systems that are designed and
operated to serve defined population densities.  To address these impacts,
the definition of "Dwelling unit," only when applied to rental housing units,
means any building or portion thereof which contains living facilities,
including provisions for sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation, as
required by this code, and additionally meets the following requirements:




   1.   Is occupied by no more than 3 adults in dwelling units up to
800 square feet in size, and up to 5 adults in dwelling units over 800 square
feet in size; and



   2.   Is occupied by not more than 2 adults per bedroom; and



   3.   Has no more than 4 resident vehicles per unit; and



   4.   Provides enough parking spaces on the property to park all
resident vehicles in spaces that meet code requirements including but not
limited to size, location, and surfacing; and



   5.   Has a valid rental permit. See Chapter 146, "Housing Code," and
Chapter 157, "Building Code."



   Notes: 
   "Adult" in this section is defined as any person over the age of 18.
   "Resident Vehicle" means any vehicle owned or in use by any given
tenant and parked at the rental unit.

170.01  HOME OCCUPATIONS.



   Home occupations may be permitted in RS, RD, and R-FB Zones, provided
the home occupation is clearly and obviously subordinate to the dwelling unit
for residential purposes, and no negative impacts as defined herein result. 
Home occupations shall be conducted wholly within the primary structure or
existing accessory building on the premises. The overriding consideration
regarding home occupation appropriateness is whether neighboring or nearby
property owners are negatively impacted either by reduced standard of living
because of characteristics of the business such as noise or traffic, or by
reduced residential property value, which the following conditions address.

CHAPTER 171
ZONING CODE – NONCONFORMING,
CONDITIONAL, AND TEMPORARY USES



 

171.01  Nonconforming Structures and Uses
 
171.03  Temporary Uses


171.02  Conditional Uses
 



 



171.01  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES.



   1.   General.  Except as otherwise required by law, a structure or
use legally established prior to the adoption date of this code may be
maintained unchanged.  In other than criminal proceedings, the owner,
occupant, or user shall have the burden to show that the structure, lot, or
use was lawfully established.



   2.   Discontinuance.



      A.   Vacancy.  Any lot or structure, or portion thereof,
occupied by a nonconforming use, which is or hereafter becomes vacant and
remains unoccupied by a nonconforming use for a period of one year shall not
be occupied, except by a use which conforms to this code.



      B.   Destruction.  If any nonconforming structure or use is,
by any cause, destroyed to the extent of 50 percent of its market value as
determined by the Code Official, it shall not thereafter be reconstructed.



   3.   Enlargements and Modifications.



      A.   Maintenance and Repairs.  Maintenance, repairs, and
structural alterations may be made to nonconforming structures or to a
building housing a nonconforming use with valid permits.



      B.   Change of Nonconforming Use.  A change of use of a
nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land shall not be made except
to that of conforming use.  Where such change is made, the use shall not
thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use.



      C.   Additions.  All additions to nonconforming structures
shall conform to the requirements of this code.  Additions to structures
housing nonconforming uses that increase the area of a nonconforming use
shall not be made.



171.02  CONDITIONAL USES.



   A conditional use permit shall be obtained for certain uses which may
be harmonious under special conditions and in specific locations within a
zone, but may not be allowed under the general conditions of the zone as
stated in this code.



   1.   Applications.  All conditional-use permit applications shall
be submitted to the Code Official as provided in this code.  All
applications shall be accompanied by maps, drawings, statements, or other
documents as required by the Council or staff.  Appropriate fees shall be
collected at the time of submittal as determined by the Council.



   2.   Public Hearing.  Prior to any action on a conditional use
permit, a public hearing shall be held by the Board of Adjustment.



   3.   Determination.  Upon consideration of an application for a
conditional use permit, the Commission shall itemize, describe and justify,
then record and file in writing, to the Board of Adjustment, any recommended
conditions to be imposed on the use, along with its general recommendation to
approve, amend, or deny the application.  After consideration and upon
recommendation of the Commission, the Board of Adjustment shall have the
authority to impose conditions and safeguards as deemed necessary to protect
and enhance the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding area.  The
authorization of a conditional use permit shall not be made unless evidence
is presented to establish that:



      A.   Such use will not, under specific circumstances of a
particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of
the surrounding area and that the proposed use is necessary or desirable and
provides a service or facility that contributes to the general well-being of
the surrounding area; and



      B.   Such use will comply with the regulations and conditions
specified in this code for such use. 



   4.   Expiration and Revocation.  Any granted conditional use permit
shall become null and void within one year of the date of approval if not
exercised.  A conditional use permit shall be considered exercised when the
use has been established or when a building permit has been issued and
substantial construction accomplished.  If such permit is abandoned or
discontinued for a period of one year, it may not be reestablished unless
authorized by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with this section.  A
conditional use permit may be revoked if the applicant fails to comply with
the imposed conditions.



   5.   Adjustments.  An adjustment to an approved conditional use
permit shall be submitted to the Code Official accompanied by supporting
information.  The Board of Adjustment, upon receiving Commission
recommendation, may grant, deny, or amend such adjustment.



171.03  TEMPORARY USES.



   These regulations are intended to prescribe the conditions under which
activities of limited duration may be conducted.  The intent is to prevent
the creation of nuisances or annoyances to the occupants of adjacent
buildings, premises, or property, and to the general public. Considerations
for all types of temporary uses listed herein shall include:  compatibility
with adjacent uses; potential adverse effects to the surrounding neighborhood
because of odor, noise, dust, or other nuisances, especially as they may
relate to the consumption of alcohol; parking needs, if applicable; and
potential traffic increases and resulting impacts on the surrounding
neighborhood or city at large.  Temporary uses are categorized into the
following three types: Minor Temporary Uses, Special Events, and Zoning
Temporary Uses, as defined and restricted herein; and several special uses.



   1.   Minor Temporary Uses.  Minor temporary uses are those very

172.01  PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   The Council finds that in order to ensure public safety; provide
efficient delivery of services by the City and others wishing to utilize
wireless communication technologies; ensure the health, safety, and welfare
of the population; provide for the regulation and administration and orderly
location of antenna arrays and towers; and secure the rights of the City to
regulate its public property and charge a reasonable fee for use of public
property, it is necessary for the City to establish these uniform rules,
regulations and policies.



172.02  DEFINITIONS.



   As used in this chapter:



      "Antenna" means a device, dish, or array used to transmit or
receive telecommunication signals.



      "Communications" means the electronic, telephonic, or other
high-tech transmission, reception, or exchange of data or information between
or among points specified by the user of information of the user's choosing,
without change in the form or content of the information as sent or received.



      "Communications tower" means a tower, pole, or similar structure
which supports a communications antenna operated for commercial purposes
above ground in a fixed location, whether free standing, guyed, or on a
building.



      "Height" means the distance from ground level at the base of the
tower or the base of any supporting structure to the top of the structure
including any antenna(s) or other appurtenances.



172.03  LOCAL REGULATION.



   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits the City from establishing
policies that discriminate against one or a group of providers in favor of
another or another group of providers or potential providers. The following
objectives shall be applied consistently to all telecommunications providers
that request a location for their communication towers and antennas:



   1.   To minimize the overall number of towers located in the City,
providers may be required to participate in collocation agreements.



   2.   To ensure that new towers will blend into their environment,
providers will propose designs consistent with site characteristics.



   3.   To maximize safety new towers will be located away from
population and employment centers and siting of new towers will include fall
zone setbacks as specified herein.



172.04  FACILITIES LOCATED ON CITY PROPERTY.



   1.   Lease Required.  No tower or antenna owner shall use any
public property without first obtaining a lease from the City.



   2.   Insurance Required.  The tower owner will produce proof of
adequate liability insurance for potential damage that could reasonably be
caused to City personnel, property and facilities by the location of the
towers, antennas or facilities on City property.



   3.   Priorities.  Priority of the use of City-owned land or
structures will be given to the following entities in descending order of
priority:



      A.   All functions of the City.



      B.   Public safety agencies that are not part of the City,
including law enforcement, fire and ambulance services, and private entities
with a public safety agreement with the City.



      C.   Other governmental agencies for uses which are not
related to public safety.



      D.   Entities providing communication services, including
cellular, personal communication services, specialized mobilized radio,
enhanced specialized mobilized radio, paging and similar services that are
marketed to the general public for business and/or personal use.



   4.   Placement of Facilities.  The placement and maintenance of
communication towers, antennas, and facilities on City-owned sites, such as
water towers and parks, will be considered when the following requirements
are met:



      A.   Water Tower or Reservoir Sites.  The City's water tower
and reservoir represent a large public investment in water pressure
stabilization and peak capacity reserves, and its protection is of prime
importance. For that reason, the placement of communication towers or
antennas on water towers or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the
following requirements are found by the City to be met:



         (1)   The owner must have approval from the City each
time access to any equipment mounted on a water tower is desired. This will
minimize the risk of contamination to the water supply.



         (2)   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or
the grounds to accommodate the owner's facilities.



         (3)   The presence of the facility will not
substantially increase the water tower or reservoir maintenance costs to the
City.



         (4)   The presence of the facility will not be harmful
to the health or safety of workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.



      B.   Parks. The presence of communications towers, antennas,
or similar facilities represents a potential conflict with the purpose of
City-owned parks and recreational facilities. Communications towers and
antennas will be considered only in park facilities that are remote from
places where people regularly live, work or gather and large enough to
accommodate the use without significant impact to adjacent property owners,
after recommendation of the Parks and Recreation Commission and approval of
the Council.



172.05  SETBACK AND MAXIMUM HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.



   1.   A tower must be set back:



      A.   From all ID or residential lot lines a distance equal to
or greater than the tower height.



      B.   From lot lines of all other districts a distance equal to
or greater than the height of the tower; however, if the tower manufacturer
certifies that the tower is designed to collapse within a smaller area, the
setbacks may be reduced consistent with said certification but shall in no
case be less than 50% of the height of the tower. Use of the tower
manufacturer's certification to reduce the set back as described herein is
subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer.



   2.   Any communications facilities located on the roof of an antenna
support structure must be set back at least one foot from the edge of the
roof of the structure. This setback requirement shall not apply to
communications facilities located above the roof of the structure, if the
facilities are:



      A.   Appropriately screened from view through the use of
panels, walls, fences or other screening techniques approved by the City; or



      B.   Camouflaged antennas that are mounted to the exterior of
the antenna support structures below the roof but do not protrude more than
24 inches from the side of such an antenna support structure.



   3.   The following height conditions apply:



      A.   Commercial and Public Use Districts. Freestanding or
guyed tower with a height not exceeding 200 feet.



      B.   Industrial Districts. Freestanding or guyed tower with
height not exceeding 360 feet.



172.06  NOISE AND EMISSION STANDARDS.



   No equipment shall be operated at towers or telecommunications
facilities so as to produce noise in excess of applicable standards under
WAC173-60, except during emergencies or periodic routine maintenance which
requires the use of a backup generator where the noise standards may be
exceeded temporarily.



172.07  ABANDONMENT.



   In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued
for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the City
Administrator, who shall have the right to request documentation and/or
affidavits from the communications tower owner regarding the issue of tower
usage. At 181 days after the date of abandonment, without reactivating or
upon completion of dismantling or removal, any City approval for the tower
shall automatically expire. Upon abandonment, the owner of the tower shall
have an additional 90 days within which to reactivate the use of the tower,
transfer the tower to another owner who makes actual use of the tower within
the 90 days, or dismantle and remove the tower. If not done within this 90
day period, the City may dismantle and remove the tower with all costs
assessed to the tower owner.

180.01  TITLE.



   This ordinance shall be known and may be referred to as the Subdivision
Ordinance.  Whenever the phrase "this ordinance" appears in this code
chapter, it refers to this Subdivision Ordinance.



180.02  AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.



   1.   Authority.  This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the
authority granted the City of North Liberty under Chapter 354 of the Code of
Iowa, enabling cities to regulate the development of land within their
jurisdictions and to promote good planning practices.



   2.   Purpose.  This purposes of this ordinance are to:



      A.   Serve the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the City and its residents.



      B.   Encourage orderly community development consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan.



      C.   Provide consistent high standards to ensure the
functional arrangement and economical functioning of public improvements,
open spaces, utilities, and other features of land subdivision and
development.



      D.   Avoid excessive costs to the taxpayers of the City for
the provision of public services and utilities by apportioning appropriate
shares of those costs to new development.



180.03  JURISDICTION AND APPLICABILITY.



   This ordinance is adopted by the City to govern the subdivision and
resubdivision of all lands within the corporate limits of the City. In
addition, all subdivisions and resubdivisions located within 2 miles of the
City's corporate boundaries shall be subject to City review and approval, as
provided by Iowa Code Section 354.9, except for those areas exempt from such
review pursuant to any fringe area agreements or annexation moratoriums that
may be enacted with Johnson County or neighboring cities.



180.04  ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTROL.



   No owner of real property within the City of North Liberty may
subdivide or plat such property into two or more lots for buildings or for
any other use, without first gaining approval as provided for in this
ordinance. In addition, no individual may sell or construct buildings on any
lots or parts of real property that are not subdivided as required by state
law and this ordinance. These directives also apply to property within two
miles of the North Liberty corporate limits, except for those areas exempt
from such review pursuant to any fringe area agreements or annexation
moratoriums that may be enacted with Johnson County or neighboring cities.



180.05  PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.



   Any violation of this ordinance shall be considered a municipal
infraction and subject to enforcement as provided in Chapter 3 of the North
Liberty City Code.



180.06  BUILDING PERMITS RESTRICTED.



   When a plat is required by provisions of this ordinance, the City shall
not issue any building permit for construction on any lot, parcel, or tract
until a plat is approved and recorded.



180.07  APPLICANT STANDING.



   1.   All applicants are presumed to be in good standing with the
City and therefore have a right to submit applications in accordance with the
processes and standards set forth in this chapter.  However, the City
Administrator has the authority to place any application, including but not
limited to a preliminary plat application or a final plat application,
construction plans, or developer's agreement, on hold indefinitely or
withdraw any permit at any stage in the respective process by providing
written notice of the same to the applicant by regular mail, in the event the
applicant has not fulfilled any significant obligations to the City with
respect to current or previous development activities within the City.  For
the purposes of this section, "development activities" include activities and
actions related to preliminary plats, construction plans, developer's
agreements, final plats, and site plans.



   2.   For the purposes of this section, "applicant" means any
individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, limited liability
company, or any other business entity or proprietor of land.  Any individual
person or business entity with a 5% interest or more in the ownership or
development of any particular property, whether previously approved or
currently proposed, is an "applicant" for the purpose of enforcement of this
section.



   3.   In the event the City Administrator exercises the discretion
and authority set forth in this section by placing an application on hold or
withdrawing a permit, any applicant may appeal that decision to the City
Council within 10 days of the date of the notice.  The City Council shall
hear and decide the appeal of the City Administrator's decision within 30
days after the applicant provides written notice of appeal to the City
Administrator.  If the City Council decides the appeal in favor of the
applicant, the City Administrator shall immediately lift the administrative
hold and ensure that the application is processed or the permit is reissued
in accordance with the City's ordinances, processes and procedures.



180.08  VARIATIONS.



   1.   Upon recommendation of the Planning Commission or on its own
motion, the City Council may vary, modify or waive requirements of this
ordinance; however, no such action shall be taken by the Council unless
affirmative findings are made for each of the applicable following criteria:



      A.   Unique Circumstances.  The subject property is unique or
exceptional as compared to other properties subject to the same provisions by
reason of irregularity, narrowness, shallowness, substandard or marginal
size, exceptional topographical features, or other extraordinary conditions
peculiar to and inherent in the subject property that relate to or arise out
of the property rather than the personal situation of the current owner of
the property, and that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner.



      B.   Not Exclusively for Financial Gain.  The purpose of the
variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase financial gain
from the property. Proof that the property cannot be used for its highest or
best use under the regulations applicable to it, or that it could be used
more profitably if not subject to such regulations, should not in itself
justify granting a variation.



      C.   Unique Circumstances Not Self-Created.  The unique or
special condition referenced above either existed at the time of the
enactment of the provisions of this ordinance that affect it, or was the
result of government action, other than adoption of this ordinance, for which
no compensation was paid, and which has not been created by any persons
presently having an interest in the property.



      D.   Substantial Rights Denied.  Carrying out the strict
letter of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the property owner
of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners subject to
the same provisions.



      E.   Not Special Privilege.  The hardship affecting the
property is not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some
special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of
other property subject to the same provisions.



      F.   Not Detrimental.  Granting the variation will not be
detrimental to the public welfare or materially injurious to the enjoyment,
use, or development of property in the vicinity; nor will it materially
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent properties;
substantially increase congestion in the public streets; increase the danger
of flood or fire; endanger the public safety; or substantially diminish or
impair property values in the vicinity.



      G.   No Other Remedy.  There are no means other than the
requested variation by which the hardship can be avoided or remedied to a
degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the property.



   2.   City Council Action.  The City Council shall note approval of
any variation as provided in this section in the resolution approving the
final subdivision plat.

described in this section.



   1.   Auditor's Plat.  A survey ordered to be completed and recorded
by the County Auditor to clarify boundaries and to provide an accurate legal
description of parcels for taxation purposes.



      A.   Scope.  An Auditor's Plat may be used only if ordered by
the County Auditor, and may not be used to create new lots or adjust lots
within the City of North Liberty without that order.



      B.   Application Procedure and Review.  An Auditor's Plat is
not subject to review and approval by the City of North Liberty.



   2.   Plat of Survey.  A map document, prepared pursuant to Iowa
Code, that may be utilized to combine existing legally platted parcels of
land, or to adjust lot lines between adjacent legally-platted lots; however,
all resulting lots shall meet zoning ordinance bulk requirements at the time
the plat of survey is prepared, and no new buildable lot may be created.



      A.   Scope.  A Plat of Survey may be used to adjust common
lot lines between two lots if the adjustment meets the following conditions:



         (1)   The Plat of Survey does not create any additional
lots or parcels;



         (2)   The Plat of Survey does not create the need for
the extension of streets, utilities, or any other new public improvements;



         (3)   Each resulting lot will conform fully to all
requirements of the zoning district in which the parcels of land are located,
and each lot is developable in the zoning district in which it is located; and



         (4)   No new violations of this ordinance, the Zoning
Ordinance, or state law would be created by the Plat of Survey.



      B.   Application and Review Procedure.  A Boundary Adjustment
Permit shall be prepared by a surveyor and submitted to the City Clerk for
approval by the Code Official prior to submission to the County Recorder's
Office.



   3.   Subdivision Plat.  A subdivision plat is used to establish new
lots if conditions for approving a Plat of Survey cannot be met.



      A.   Application and Review Procedure. The subdivision plat
process includes five major parts: a planning conference, a good neighbor
meeting, a preliminary plat, construction of improvements, and a final plat.



      B.   Application and Review Procedure.  The complete process
for subdivision plat processing requires submittal of both a preliminary and
final plats. The preliminary plat and a final plat of part or all of the
preliminary plat may be submitted concurrently, but the City may hold or
delay action on the final plat if necessary to ensure thorough review and
processing. The formal City review process is generally consistent with the
following abbreviated summary of actions and timeline:

180.11  SUBDIVISION PLAT PREPARATION, REVIEW, AND SUBMITTAL PROCESS
REQUIREMENTS.



   1.   Planning Conference.  The applicant or representative shall
meet informally with City staff prior to submitting the preliminary plat in
order to discuss the proposed subdivision. The purpose of this planning
conference is informational only, and no approval can be given nor can any
requirements of this ordinance be waived. In general, the applicant is
expected to provide a map showing the following:



      A.   The property proposed to be subdivided and surrounding
property boundaries and streets;



      B.   Contours of the property and surrounding properties;



      C.   Buildings on the site, wooded areas, wetlands, and other
major features; and



      D.   A concept for the subdivision of the property.



   2.   Good Neighbor Meeting.



      A.   After the planning conference but before a preliminary
plat is submitted to the City, the applicant shall arrange for a Good
Neighbor meeting to be held to notify residents of a possible subdivision and
to provide an opportunity for comments; however, a Good Neighbor meeting is
not required if the plat meets the following criteria as determined by City
staff:



         (1)   The plat does not create the need for the
extension of streets, utilities or any other new public improvements:



         (2)   The area being platted has already been subdivided
through a process that included City review and approval:



         (3)   Each resulting lot will conform fully to all
requirements of the zoning district in which the parcels of land are located,
and each lot is developable in the zoning district in which it is located: and



         (4)   No new violations of any City codes or adopted
standards would be created by the plat.



      B.   The applicant shall coordinate with the City Planner to
schedule a meeting, to be moderated by the City Planner with the assistance
of the applicant, prior to submission of the preliminary plat. The meeting
shall be held prior to any City Staff action on the subdivision application,
other than the planning conference.



      C.   The City, at the applicant's expense, shall send out by
regular mail an announcement to the property owners within 200 feet of the
boundaries of the property proposed to be subdivided that a meeting,
including the time, date and location, will be held to discuss the
subdivision proposal, no later than fourteen days prior to the meeting. The
City shall cause to be published a notice of the meeting, at the applicant's
expense, and also post notice of the meeting on its website, both of which
shall be done at least seven days prior to the meeting. The Planning
Commission, Mayor and City Council will be notified of the meeting at least
seven days prior to the meeting. These required mailings and notices shall
include a plain language description of the location and boundaries of the
subject property, and may include a location and/or draft plat.



      D.   Rezoning applications also require a Good Neighbor
meeting to be held subject to the same requirements as found in this section.
In the event that a proposed subdivision follows or is concurrent with a
rezoning of the same property, the requirements of this section shall be
fulfilled at the same Good Neighbor meeting if both are presented at said
meeting.



   3.   Preliminary Subdivision Plat Submittal Requirements and Review.
The preliminary plat, in general, contains more information than the final
plat, so that the subdivider and the City can ensure conformance with codes,
master facility plans, and good planning and engineering practices. Though
the preliminary plat is not recorded, it is approved by resolution of the
City Council, and conditions for approval of the plat shall be addressed on
any final plats of the same area.



      A.   Preliminary Plat Contents. The application shall include
a preliminary plat of the subdivision drawn to a scale of one inch to one
hundred feet minimum, and shall show:



         (1)   A location map to provide spatial reference,
showing the outline of the area to be subdivided, existing streets and
corporate limits in the vicinity, a north arrow and scale or note stating
"not to scale," and other information that might help clarify where the plat
is located as well as its surroundings and size relative to other City
features;



         (2)   Name of proposed subdivision and date;

   4.   Costs and Fees.



      A.   The filing of the preliminary plat of a subdivision shall
be accompanied by an application fee as established by City Council
resolution from time to time.



      B.   The applicant shall also be responsible for payment of
the actual costs of the City Engineer's review or additional engineering
reviews necessitated by the submission of an incomplete plat or plat that
fails to meet the minimum requirements for plats set by this ordinance or
written City policy adopted by the City Council. The above-referenced costs
and fees shall be paid by the applicant within thirty days of receipt of the
costs by the applicant.



   5.   Review and Approval Procedure.  The City process for
preliminary plat review and approval is generally as follows:



      A.   Submittal is made to the City Clerk by noon of the first
working day of the month, and copies are distributed to the staff review team.



      B.   Near the middle of the month, the staff review team meets
to discuss cases, and a preliminary memorandum is prepared and forwarded to
the contact person. The preliminary memorandum outlines deficiencies in the
plat, recommendations for improving the plat, and a due date for resubmission
of the corrected or modified plat, if necessary. The review may also identify
the need for additional studies to be completed by the applicant, including
but not limited to traffic impact studies and utility investigations.



      C.   Near the end of the month, the plat is resubmitted with
corrections and changes. If ordinance and regulatory provisions are met, the
plat is placed on the next Planning Commission agenda.



      D.   The Planning Commission receives the plat, along with a
final staff report containing any recommendations, and makes a formal
recommendation to City Council for approval, approval with conditions, or
denial. The Planning Commission may also table action on a preliminary plat
if the Commission feels additional information is needed to make a
recommendation.



      E.   City Council receives the plat, along with the final
staff report and recommendation from the Planning Commission, and formally
acts by resolution on the plat to approve, approve with conditions, or deny.
The City Council may also table action on a preliminary plat if the Council
feels additional information is needed to reach a decision. If a Preliminary
Plat Agreement has been prepared, the City Council also acts to approve the
agreement.



   6.   Standards for Approval.  In addition to all provisions found
in this and other ordinances, the City may impose additional limitations or
directives intended to ensure that subdivisions are logical, are compatible
with surrounding areas, and generally will be an asset to the City when
completed. Such issues may include but are not limited to lot size and
layout; street, sidewalk and trail type, alignment, and location; and
infrastructure location, type, and size.



   7.   Effect of Preliminary Plat Approval and Expiration.  The
approval of the preliminary application by the City Council does not create
legally buildable lots or entitle the owner to building permits, but it is an
authorization to proceed with preparation of construction plans, a
developer's agreement, permit applications leading to construction of
improvements, and ultimately the preparation of a final plat.  Approval of
the preliminary application shall be effective for a period of 36 months,
after which time approval of the plat is null and void unless extensions or
reinstatements are approved by the Council or final plats are recorded as
follows:



      A.   Upon written request of the subdivider, the City Council
by resolution may grant up to an 18 month extension of time. Consideration of
granting an extension or reinstatement may include but is not limited to the
following criteria: considerations related to changes in surrounding
properties; changes in  infrastructure needs; changes in code requirements;
or other factors related to whether the subdivision as approved remains
appropriate and in the best interests of the City; or



      B.   Final plats of all or parts of the preliminary plat are
recorded prior to the expiration of the preliminary plat. Any time a final
plat is recorded, the preliminary plat approval shall be automatically
extended for a new period of 18 months from the date Council approved the
recorded final plat.



   8.   Construction of Improvements.



      A.   Options for Improvements.  Installation or provisions
for the installation of public infrastructure such as streets, street lights,
and sanitary sewer and water mains are to be completed prior to acceptance of
any final plat. Improvements may be provided for in one of the following two
means by an owner:



         (1)   Construction of all improvements and installations
in the subdivision as approved by the City Engineer, or construction of all
improvements and installations in the subdivision as approved by the City
Engineer with the exception of sidewalks. In the latter case, the owner shall
execute an agreement as a covenant running with the land providing that the
sidewalks shall be installed in accordance with the developer's agreement,
and in the event that installation has not been made, that the owner waives
all statutory requirements of notice of time and place and hearing, waives
statutory protections and limitations as to cost and assessment, and agrees
that the City may install the sidewalks and assess the costs thereof against
the real estate; or



         (2)   A letter of credit, escrow, performance bond, or
other financial instrument in a form approved by the City, filed with the
City Clerk that guarantees to the City that the improvements, as approved by
the City Engineer, will be completed by the subdivider or property owner
within two years after official acceptance of the final plat. The form and
type of instrument shall be approved by the City Attorney and City Council,
and shall be equal to 110% of the amount of the estimated costs. If the
improvements are not complete within the specified time, the City may use the
instrument or any necessary portion thereof to complete the improvements.



      B.   Construction Plan Submittal, Review and Approval.  Four
construction plan sets and supporting calculations, prepared by an engineer,
shall be submitted to the City for review and comment. Construction plans are
not considered final until formally approved by the City Engineer.



      C.   Construction Permitting.  Once construction plans are
approved, a subdivision construction permit may be obtained and construction
may proceed. Applications for construction permits shall include the
following:



         (1)   Letter from the City Engineer recommending
approval of the plans.



         (2)   DNR construction permits.

      D.   Costs and Fees.  The applicant shall be responsible for
all necessary engineering costs associated with the review of construction
plans, drainage plans, grading plans or other similar plans related to the
subdivision.



   9.   Final Subdivision Plat Submittal Requirements and Review.  The
final plat, in general, contains information required by State Code and is
recorded once approved by resolution of the City Council. The application
shall include the following:



      A.   Final Plat Contents.  The final plat shall show the
following drawn to a minimum scale of 1"=100':



         (1)   A location map to provide spatial reference,

      C.   Costs and Fees.



         (1)   The filing of the final plat of a subdivision
shall be accompanied by an application fee as established by the City Council
from time to time.



         (2)   The applicant shall also be responsible for
payment of the actual costs of the City Engineer's review or additional
engineering reviews necessitated by the submission of an incomplete plat or
plat that fails to meet the minimum requirements for plats set by this
ordinance or written City policy adopted by the City Council. The
above-referenced costs and fees shall be paid by the applicant within thirty
days of receipt of the first notice of costs by the applicant. Failure to pay
these costs and fees when assessed to the applicant may be cause for denial
of the plat or subdivision or any further plats or subdivisions submitted by
the applicant.



         (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for the actual
costs associated with any subsequent engineering review costs necessitated by
the submission of an incomplete plat or plat not in compliance with the final
plat requirements set by City ordinance or written policy formally adopted by
the City Council. The applicant shall be responsible for all necessary
engineering costs associated with the review of construction plans, drainage
plans, grading plans or other similar plans related to the subdivision.



      D.   Review and Approval Procedure.  The City process for
final plat review and approval is generally as follows:



         (1)   Submittal is made to the City Clerk by noon of the
first working day of the month, and copies are distributed to the staff
review team.



         (2)   Near the middle of the month, the staff review
team meets to discuss cases, and a preliminary memo is prepared and forwarded
to the contact person. The preliminary memo outlines deficiencies in the plat
and recommendations for improving the plat, and contains a due date for
resubmission of the plat, if necessary.



         (3)   Near the end of the month, the plat is resubmitted
with corrections and changes. If ordinance and regulatory provisions are met,
the plat is placed on the next City Council agenda.



         (4)   City Council receives the plat, along with the
final staff report, and formally acts by resolution on the plat to approve or
deny. The City Council may also table action on a final plat if it determines
it does not have adequate information to reach a decision.



      E.   Effect of Final Plat Approval and Expiration.  The
approval of the final plat by the City Council constitutes approval of the
subdivision and improvements or plans for improvements.  Final plats shall
be recorded immediately upon approval by the City Council, and approval may
be rescinded if not recorded within 6 months of approval.



180.12  DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.



   1.   General Requirements.



      A.   The design of any subdivision shall comply with the
standards of this ordinance, provide for the orderly growth and development
of the City, demonstrate consistency with the North Liberty Comprehensive
Plan and any specific adopted district plans, and take into consideration the
natural features of the site and patterns of adjacent development.



      B.   The subdivider of property shall be responsible for
constructing all public improvements associated with the proposed subdivision
according to design standards established by the City, except for special
circumstances such as oversizing of facilities, as determined by the City.



   2.   Use Buffers - Yards and Screening.



      A.   Definition and Purpose.  "Use Buffer" means a yard or
portion of a yard along with plantings, berming, landscaping, or fencing,
which provides both a physical separation and screening between potentially
incompatible land uses or between a land use and a public road. Buffer yards
are required to separate different land uses from each other in order to
eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, odor, litter, noise,
glare of lights, signs and unsightly buildings or parking areas.



      B.   Relationship to Zoning Required Yards.  Use buffers may
be located partially or completely within front, side, or rear yards required
to meet Zoning Ordinance setback requirements; however, use buffers must meet
the requirements outlined in the following General Requirements section.



      C.   General Requirements.



         (1)   Use Restrictions.  Buffer yard areas shall
contain mainly landscaping and turf. No principal buildings, outbuildings,
parking lots or aisles, outside storage or display, or any other active use
shall be located within the yard area, with the following exceptions:



            (a)   Drives accessing the site, but only if
perpendicular to the buffer's length; and



            (b)   Pedestrian ways.



         (2)   Easement Required.  All buffer yard areas shall
be established by easement recorded on the final plat, with clear delineation
of maintenance responsibilities presented in the recorded final plat
documents that will be recorded.



         (3)   Responsibility.  Establishment of the buffer yard
easement and landscaping, and ongoing maintenance of the area, is the
responsibility of the lot owner with the more intense land use, or in the
case of arterial buffers, the single adjacent owner.



         (4)   Existing Incompatibilities.  This chapter is not
applicable to lots established prior to the adoption date of this ordinance.



         (5)   Yards Required and Dimensions.  The type and
width of buffer yard required between two adjacent parcels or between a
parcel and a street is determined by the use or proposed use of all adjoining
land, the zoning district or districts in which the property is located and
the zoning districts adjoining the subject property, as specified in the
following table.

1  If uses are separated by a street right-of-way, or if a screen fence is
constructed, the buffer yard width may be reduced by ½.




 



         (6)   Screening.  Adequate screening levels and type of
screening shall take ground level and views from the adjacent property into
consideration in observing the following requirements:



            (a)   In all cases when a use buffer is required,
a green belt planting strip shall be established, consisting of evergreen
trees and/or deciduous trees and plants of sufficient width and density to
provide a visual screen. Earth mounding of berms may be used to achieve no
more than four feet of the required screen;



            (b)   In cases where incompatible uses are
directly adjacent, a screening fence constructed of masonry, brick, wood,
vinyl, or similar material compatible with the less-intense zoning district
shall be constructed in the buffer area in conjunction with the planting and
berming plan. Such fence and plantings shall provide a solid screening effect
six feet in height; and



            (c)   Buffer yard screening through the use of a
fence only shall not be allowed.



         (7)   Buffer Plan Required. Prior to approval of a final
plat, a buffer plan is required for all buffer areas. The buffer plan,
illustrating plant type, size, quantity, location, planting specifications,
and grading shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect.



         (8)   Plant Size.  All plants must at least equal the
following minimum sizes. Larger plant materials may be required when
necessary for immediate screening.

         (9)   Plant Spacing.  Plant material centers shall not
be located closer than three feet from the fence line or property line, and
shall be planted to not conflict with public plantings. Where plant materials
are planted in two or more rows, plantings shall be staggered in rows.



         (10)   Ground Cover.  All portions of the buffer yard
not occupied by plantings or fencing shall be seeded or sodded with grass or
ornamental groundcover.



         (11)   Existing Conditions. Any existing plant material
or site topography which otherwise satisfies the landscaping standards may be
used to satisfy the conditions of this chapter.



         (12)   Slopes. Turf slopes of all berms shall not exceed
a 3:l ratio.



         (13)   Maintenance. Screening shall be maintained in
perpetuity by the owner.



         (14)   Corner Visual Clearance.  On corner lots at
street intersections in all districts, no structure, fence or planting
material in excess of three feet in height above the street grade shall be
permitted within a triangular area identified by connecting two points
measured 25 feet from the intersection of the two lot lines forming the
street intersection along each of those two lot lines.



   3.   Streets and Circulation.  The road system shall be designed to
permit the safe, efficient, and orderly movement of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic; to meet the needs of the present and future population served; to
have a simple and logical pattern and allow that pattern to continue through
adjacent properties; and to respect natural features and topography.



      A.   Streets and Driveways.  When a drive provides the
frontage for one or more lots as required in the Zoning Ordinance, that drive
shall be designated as a street and shall meet all design and construction
regulations for streets contained in this ordinance and in the City's
construction design standards.



      B.   Connectivity.  Subdivisions shall provide for
continuation and extension of arterial, collector and local streets,
sidewalks and trails in accordance with the following standards:



         (1)   Arterial streets shall be located and extended in
general accordance with the Metropolitan Planning Organization of Johnson
County (MPOJC) Arterial Street Plan and the North Liberty Comprehensive Plan.



         (2)   All streets, sidewalks, and trails shall connect
to other streets, sidewalks, and trails within the development, and to the
property lines to provide for their extension to adjacent properties. Each
subdivision shall contribute to the larger interconnected street pattern of
the City to provide for street connectivity between neighborhoods, multiple
travel routes resulting in the diffusion and distribution of traffic,
efficient routes for public and emergency services, and direct and continuous
vehicular and pedestrian travel routes to neighborhood destinations.



      C.   Turning Lanes.  Separate turning lanes may be required
on arterial streets and on streets connecting to arterial streets if existing
or forecasted traffic warrants the lanes.



      D.   Cul-de-sacs.  Use of cul-de-sacs and other roadways with
a single point of access should be avoided. Cul-de-sacs will be considered
where it can be clearly demonstrated that environmental constraints, existing
development, access limitations along arterial streets, or other unusual
features prevent the extension of the street to the property line or to
interconnect with other streets within or abutting the subdivision. In such
cases, the maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be no more than 900 feet
measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of the
turn-around; the cul-de-sac turn-around shall be centered in the turn-around
right-of-way; and the minimum outside radius of the pavement of cul-de-sac
bulbs shall be 40 feet.  A center landscaped island may be installed if
approved by the City as a part of the construction design plans. In such a
case, the minimum radius shall be 11 feet, and the developer's agreement
shall designate and set forth procedures for benefitted property owners or a
homeowner's association to maintain the landscaped area. Said instrument
shall provide that if said services are not provided as required therein, the
City shall have the right to perform said services, and the cost thereof
shall be a lien and charge against all of the subject lots.



      E.   Street Design Criteria Summary.  The following table
provides a summary of requirements for various street types. If boulevards,
bike lanes, or other non-standard street types are planned, additional
right-of-way may be necessary.

      H.   Parkway.



         (1)   The parkway shall slope to the street at a rate of
0.5 inches vertical per horizontal foot.



         (2)   The parkway shall be landscaped with grass except
in areas so narrow that grass will not grow well or in commercial areas where
alternative materials are proposed to create a special environment
aesthetically. In such areas, alternate materials may be used only upon
approval of the City Engineer.



      I.   Dedication of Right-of-Way.  Land shall be dedicated to
the City for all public street rights-of-way within the development and for
any public street right-of-way that is needed for streets that abut or will
abut the development.



   4.   Measurements and Construction Standards.



      A.   All right-of-way improvements shall be designed and
constructed according to the design standards established by the City.



      B.   All street paving widths shall be measured and referred
to from back-of-curb to back-of-curb.



      C.   The design speed will be used to design the geometric
features, including but not limited to sight distance, intersections, and
curve radii for arterial streets to current AASHTO standards; however, in no
case shall said design speed be less than 35 miles per hour.



   5.   Street Intersections.



      A.   A maximum of four legs are allowed at any one
intersection.



      B.   The distance between street intersections shall be at
least 125 feet centerline to centerline.



      C.   Intersection angles of street center lines shall be
between 80 and 100 degrees.



      D.   Dead end streets and alleys are not permitted except at
subdivision boundaries abutting undeveloped areas. In such cases, a temporary
turn-around for fire apparatus may be required to be constructed to City
specifications.



   6.   Traffic Calming Features.  The street network, block length,
and layout of lots should be designed in a manner that discourages speeding
traffic and unsafe driving behavior. In order to minimize the potential for
speeding traffic and create a safer environment for pedestrians and bicycles,
the City may, in cases where it is warranted, require traffic calming
features to be designed into the subdivision. These features may include but
are not limited to discontinuous streets, curb extensions, raised crosswalks,
medians, or traffic circles.



   7.   Street Names.



      A.   The City reserves the right to deny the use of street
names that it determines are not in the public interest. Street names shall
be consistent with the following standards:



         (1)   In order to ensure safe an efficient provision of
public and emergency services, each proposed street name shall be distinct
from other street names within the larger metropolitan area; and



         (2)   Street names that are overly lengthy, difficult to
pronounce, or may be considered inappropriate or unappealing shall be avoided.



      B.   For new streets, the following rules apply:



         (1)   The term "street" should be used for a non-dead
end roadway aligned in a north-south direction.



         (2)   The term "avenue" should be used for a non-dead
end roadway aligned in an east-west direction;



         (3)   The term "boulevard," "road," or "drive" may be
used for a roadway that is aligned neither in a north-south nor an east-west
direction, but that changes direction or meanders; and



         (4)   The terms "lane," "court," "circle," or "place"
should be used for cul-de-sacs or low volume loop streets.



      C.   Cul-de-sacs or low volume loop streets may use the same
name as the roadway with which it intersects.  For example, a cul-de-sac
that intersects with Rose Avenue may be named "Rose Court." However, if more
than one cul-de-sac or loop street intersects with Rose Avenue, an additional
"Rose" name may not be used.



      D.   Similar names may not be used for streets that are in
different locations within the City. For example, the name, "Rose Drive," may
not be used in one neighborhood, if there is already a "Rose Avenue" in a
different neighborhood.



   8.   Private Streets.



      A.   Private streets in single family residential areas are
not allowed.



      B.   Requests for private streets in multi-family, commercial,
and industrial areas may be considered, provided that connectivity to
adjacent properties is not needed. If private streets are approved, the
subdivider must submit a legally binding instrument setting forth the
procedures to be followed for maintaining private streets and providing
garbage service, snow removal, street sweeping, and financing these services.
Such costs shall be shared by all owners of property located within the
subdivision, or designated portion thereof, through the use of an owners
association or other entity satisfactory to the City. Said instrument shall
provide that if said services are not performed as required therein, the City
shall have the right to perform said services, and the cost thereof shall be
a lien and charge against all of the owners of lots so designated in the
subdivision.



      C.   Private streets shall be labeled as "Public Access
Easement Street" on the plat.



      D.   Private streets shall be designed and constructed to the
same standards as public streets.



   9.   Sidewalks, Trails, and Pedestrian Connections.  Public
sidewalks, trails, and pedestrian connections shall be constructed in the
public right-of-way according to the following standards:



      A.   The City's approved design standards and the approved
North Liberty Trails Network Plan shall be observed for construction
standards and location, respectively. The City will determine on which side
of the street the wide sidewalk will be placed and the specific different
width of the sidewalk.



      B.   Minimum five foot wide concrete sidewalks are required to
be constructed along both sides of all local and collector streets.



(Ord. 14-01 – Feb. 14 Supp.)



      C.   All sidewalks and trails shall connect to other sidewalks
and trails within the development and to the property line to provide for
their extension to adjacent properties.



      D.   The subdivider is responsible for the construction of a
public sidewalk along the frontage of private open space along any public
open space dedicated to the City and along the frontage of other outlots as
necessary for a continuous sidewalk system to be created.



      E.   In residential subdivisions, blocks longer than 600' must
have mid-block pedestrian connections between adjacent streets, unless said
connection is deemed to be unnecessary or infeasible and is waived by the
City. At the time of subdivision, these connections must be platted as
minimum 15 foot wide easements. If the connecting sidewalk is greater than
five feet in width, the easement must be at least 20 feet wide. Within this
easement, a sidewalk to City standards shall be constructed that is equal in
width to the sidewalks to which it provides a connection. If the mid-block
sidewalk connects to sidewalks of two different widths, the mid-block
sidewalk must be equal in width to the wider sidewalk. The area and sidewalk
within the pedestrian easement shall be maintained by adjacent property
owners according to the developer's agreement in a manner similar to
maintenance requirements for public sidewalks.



      F.   Where a trail extension, as identified in the
Comprehensive Plan or an adopted trails plan, is located on the property
being platted, the City may require installation of the trail, at the
developer's expense, and any easement or dedication of land necessary for the
trail.



   10.   Layout of Blocks and Lots.



      A.   Blocks.



         (1)   Blocks should be limited in size and be laid out
in a pattern that ensures the connectivity of streets, provides for efficient
provision of public and safety services, and establishes efficient and
logical routes between residences and non-residential destinations and public
gathering places.



         (2)   To provide multiple travel routes within and
between neighborhoods, block faces along local and collector streets should
range between 300 feet and 600 feet in length. For residential subdivisions,
blocks should have a width sufficient to accommodate two tiers of lots.
Longer block faces may be allowed in cases of large lot commercial,
industrial, or rural residential development, or where topography, water
features, or existing development prevents shorter block lengths, although
mid-block pedestrian connections may be required. Block faces are measured
from centerline to centerline of the intersecting streets.



         (3)   Block faces along arterial streets should be at
least 600 feet in length. Intersecting collector streets should be spaced in
a manner that provides adequate connectivity between neighborhoods but also
maintains the capacity of the street for the safe and efficient movement of
traffic. Longer block faces may be required along high capacity or higher
speed arterial streets where the interests in moving traffic outweigh the
connectivity between areas of development. The City may approve shorter block
faces in high density commercial areas or other areas with high pedestrian
counts.



      B.   Lots.



         (1)   Every lot shall be provided access and frontage as
specified in the Zoning Ordinance on an approved public or private street.



         (2)   Lots shall be platted in a manner that will allow
development to meet all Zoning Ordinance requirements. Lots must be of
sufficient size to accommodate an adequate buildable area and area for
required setbacks, off-street parking, and service facilities required by the
type of use and development anticipated.



         (3)   Lots with multiple frontages must be platted large
enough to accommodate front setback requirements along street-side lot lines.



         (4)   If a property with frontage only along an arterial
street is proposed to be subdivided, a cross-access easement shall be
provided by the property owner to all adjoining properties that front on the
same arterial street.



         (5)   In residential areas, double and triple frontage
lots should be avoided. Where the City determines such lots are necessary to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography, land features, or access
restrictions, the following standards apply:



            (a)   Multiple frontage and corner lots with only
two frontages shall be platted with enough land area to accommodate the
required front setback area along all frontages.



            (b)   Double and triple frontage lots where
dwellings will have side or rear building facades oriented toward an arterial
street shall provide a minimum 20 foot wide landscaped buffer area along the
arterial street frontage. The buffer area shall be planted with a mixture of
coniferous and deciduous vegetation approved by the City. The vegetation
shall be required along with other public improvements for the property. Lots
where dwellings will have front building facades oriented toward an arterial
street are exempt from this requirement. If a buffer area was required during
subdivision, no solid fences will be allowed within this buffer area. This
restriction must be noted in the developer's agreement and on the plat. On
corner lots, the landscaping within the buffer must be planted and maintained
to comply with intersection visibility standards.



            (c)   Side lot lines shall approximate right
angles to straight street lines or be approximately radial to curved street
lines, except where a variation will provide a better street and lot layout.



            (d)   Residential lots shall not be designed with
irregular shapes such as a flag or panhandle shape where the structure on the
lot may be hidden from the street behind another structure.



   11.   Street Lights.  The subdivider shall submit the proposed
street lighting placements for review by the City Engineer and City Council
approval prior to placement. In all new subdivisions, decorative street
lights shall be selected by the subdivider from an approved list provided by
the City. All costs in connection with the furnishing of street lighting
placements, decorative poles, light fixtures and related parts in new
subdivisions shall be the responsibility of the subdivider.



   12.   Sanitary Sewers.  The subdivider shall provide a complete
sanitary sewer system, including stubs, for each lot, which shall connect
with a sanitary sewer outlet approved by the City Engineer. The sanitary
sewer in each defined drainage area shall extend to the subdivision
boundaries and beyond, as necessary to provide for the extension of the
sanitary sewer to adjacent property, as determined by the City. In the event
the City requires a sewer system greater than needed to service the
subdivision under review, the City shall pay the developer for the difference
in the costs of materials for the upsizing, and future subdivisions that
connect with the subject system shall on a pro rata basis reimburse the City
for the cost for the upsizing.



   13.   Storm Water Management.  The developer shall provide the
subdivision with adequate drains, ditches, culverts, complete bridges, storm
water quality features, storm water detention, storm sewers, intakes and
manholes to provide for the collection, management, and removal of all
surface waters as set forth in the City's Design Standards. These
improvements shall extend to the boundaries of the subdivision and beyond, as
necessary to provide for extension by adjoining properties and as determined
by the City. The City will not pay for the excess cost when the subdivider is
required under state law to manage the natural drainage including between
adjoining lands.



   14.   Water Systems.  The developer shall provide the subdivision
with a complete water main supply system, including hydrants, valves and all
other appurtenances, which shall be extended into and through the subdivision
to the boundary lines and beyond as may be necessary to provide for extension
by adjoining properties, as determined by the City. The system shall provide
for a water connection for lots and shall be connected to the City water
system.



   15.   Private Utilities. The subdivider shall provide for
installation or assurances acceptable to the City for installation of
electric distribution lines, gas mains, telephone lines and other facilities
in any new subdivision as are needed, as determined by the City, before final
approval shall be given to the final plat. The subdivider shall be
responsible for making the necessary monetary arrangements to provide for
such utilities and, in addition, shall provide for underground facilities in
residential subdivisions and commercial subdivisions with each utility
company. In providing for said utility transmission lines, the subdivider
shall make sure that adequate connections are provided to each lot.



   16.   Utilities in General.



      A.   All on-site utility lines, including but not limited to
electric, communications, street lighting, and gas lines shall be installed
underground except as hereinafter provided. For the purpose of this section,
appurtenances and associated equipment such as, but not limited to,
surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter
cabinets may be placed above ground. Underground facilities need not be
installed in the following instances:



         (1)   Any increase of service size including single
phase to three-phase conversion; or



         (2)   Any new service when utility poles exist along
abutting property lines that are not separated by any alley or public
right-of-way and no additional utility poles are required.



      B.   The subdivider shall provide necessary easements in the
subdivision for placement of all utilities including street lights and will
submit to the City all proposed easements for use in the subdivision at the
time the developer's agreement is presented.



      C.   The preliminary and final subdivision plat shall be
presented to the designated representatives of the utility companies serving
the subdivision area for the purpose of review and concurrence that
sufficient easements have been obtained and shown on the final plat to
accommodate placement of their particular utility service lines.



      D.   All proposed utility line locations in public
rights-of-way or municipal easements shall be reviewed by the City for the
purpose of avoiding locational, topographic, or other conflicts. In no case
shall the permanent utility lines or appurtenances be constructed prior to
authorization and approval of the final plat by the City.



   17.   Clustered Mailboxes.



      A.   All new residential or commercial developments that
receive curbside delivery of mail shall have clustered mailboxes, unless an
exception is approved by the United States Postal Service. The location of
mailbox clusters shall be noted on the plat.



      B.   Mailbox clusters serving residential developments shall
be conveniently located for residents, generally meeting the following
criteria:



         (1)   Mailbox clusters should be located within
approximately 600 feet walking distance from any residential property served
by said mailbox cluster. Adjustments to this distance criterion may be
approved when there are not enough lots within one block or 600 feet to form
a cluster.



         (2)   Driveways shall be allowed no closer than 12 feet
from the location of a clustered mailbox as measured along the curb line of
the fronting street.



         (3)   Mailboxes must be located in a manner that will
not violate the City's intersection visibility standards.



         (4)   Locations and design must be approved by the City
and the United States Postal Service.



         (5)   Depending on the size and location of the
clustered mailbox, the City may require a vehicular pull-over lane built to
City specifications.



         (6)   Mailbox clusters shall be located on a concrete
pad built to City specifications. To provide for pedestrian access, a five
foot wide concrete sidewalk shall be provided from the mailbox cluster to the
adjacent public street and sidewalk.



         (7)   The cost of installation, including but not
limited to box units,  concrete pad, and sidewalk access, shall be borne by
the developer, and subsequent maintenance shall be carried out by the
property owners within the subdivision.



   18.   Specifications.



      A.   The type of construction, the materials, the methods and
standards of subdivision improvements shall be according to City standards
and all acquired permits.



      B.   Construction plans and specifications, including plans
for subdivision erosion control measures, shall be submitted to the City
Engineer for approval prior to construction. Construction shall not commence
until the City Engineer approves the plans and specifications.



      C.   If the infrastructure and/or grading cannot be designed
to comply with City standards, a new preliminary plat may be required at the
discretion of the City.



   19.   Record of Construction Drawings.  The record drawing shall
depict "as constructed" improvements, including deviations or revisions from
the approved construction plans. All rim and invert elevations shall be
surveyed and included on the record drawings. Stormwater management ponds,
drainageways, and structures shall be surveyed and included in the plans,
which shall be submitted by the developer's engineer with record drawing
certification clearly stated on the drawings.



   20.   Inspections.



      A.   The City Engineer or designee shall inspect the
installation of all public improvements in new subdivisions to insure
compliance with the requirements.



      B.   The subdivider shall bear the cost of such inspection,
which shall be the actual cost of the inspection by the City.



      C.   The subdivider shall provide qualified and appropriate
inspection and construction management to ensure compliance with approved
plans and specifications.



   21.   Off-Site Improvements.  When off-site improvements are
necessary for the subdivision and development of a property, the subdivider
shall be responsible for the extension of said improvements. Off-site
improvements shall be designed and constructed according to plans and
specifications approved by the City Engineer and shall be of sufficient size
and capacity to serve the full area capable of being served by the type of
improvement so that the City will not be required to construct parallel or
duplicate facilities. If said infrastructure is greater in size than that
needed to service the subdivision itself, the City, at its discretion, may
share in the expense thereof. Such cost sharing shall be according to the
procedure set forth in the developer's agreement. Any payment of excess costs
by the City shall be pursuant to state law.

APPENDIX:



USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



   The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.



   DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES



   1.   OFFICIAL COPY.  The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of
Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the
“OFFICIAL COPY.” 



   2.   DISTRIBUTION.  Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should
be made available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing
need to have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as
reference centers such as the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps
the schools.



   3.   SALE.  The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion
is not recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution
tends to result in outdated codes being used or misused. 



   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION.  The City Clerk should be responsible
for maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of
the Code of Ordinances.  Each official, elected or appointed, should return
to the City, upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials
pertaining to the office, including this Code of Ordinances.   



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])



NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



   It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed.  For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that
the first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and
so on.  We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for
the numbering of ordinances.



RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES



   Please note that two books should be maintained:  (1) the Code of
Ordinances; and (2) an ordinance book.  We will assist in the maintenance of
the Code of Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and
returning appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to
accommodate ordinances amending the Code.  The City Clerk is responsible for
maintaining the ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each
ordinance adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted
in the ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.



SUPPLEMENT RECORD



   A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is
provided in the front of the Code.  This record will indicate the number and
date of the ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently
adopted ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code.  For each
supplemented ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number,
date, topic, and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the
amending ordinance.  A periodic review of the Supplement Record and
ordinances passed will assure that all ordinances amending the Code have been
incorporated therein.



DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS



   Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be
sent to the Clerk.  It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each
person having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code
may be properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.



AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



   The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the
date of its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect
changing policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the
Courts.  Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by
the adoption of an ordinance.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.2)



   The following forms of ordinances are recommended for making amendments
to the Code of Ordinances:
