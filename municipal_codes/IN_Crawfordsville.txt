§ 31.07  PRESENTATION OF BUSINESS.



   (A)   Rule 1 — Ordinances.  The title of proposed ordinances
shall clearly set forth the nature of the contents.



      (1)   First reading.  A proposed ordinance shall be
introduced by its completed title, a brief summary of its purpose or
contents, and the recommendation of the committee of record, including that
committee’s vote on the ordinance.  The ordinance shall be read aloud in
its entirety only if requested by a member of the Council or by a member of
the public present at the meeting.



      (2)   Second reading.  Proposed ordinances, which have been
passed on first reading, shall be read by title only and at this time are
subject to amendments.  A majority vote of all members is required to amend
a proposed ordinance.  A majority vote of all members is required for
proposed ordinance, in its original or amended context, to proceed to third
reading or final passage.



      (3)   Third reading and final passage.  Proposed ordinances,
which have been passed on first and second readings, shall be read by title
only and may be amended; but should any member desire, it shall be read
through as amended.  A majority vote of all members is required for third
reading and final passage.  Failing to receive a majority vote by all
members on third reading, the proposed ordinance is defeated.

contents, and the recommendation of the committee of record, including that

passed may be rescinded by subsequent resolution.



   (D)   Rule 4 — Motions.



      (1)   A motion to adjourn cannot be reconsidered, is not
debatable and cannot be repeated unless other business has intervened between
the motions.  A motion to “reconsider” and a motion to “adjourn to a
day certain” are privileged questions and are debatable.  A motion to
“lay upon the table” is not debatable and must be voted upon at that
time.  Business which by law or necessity must or should be transacted
within a certain time is considered a question of privilege.  A motion to
“suspend the rules” is a privileged question, is not debatable, and
cannot be amended except with the consent of the mover.



      (2)   Matter “laid upon the table” may be taken up any
time; except a motion to reconsider once laid on the table may not be taken
up again.

that under discussion shall be admitted under color of an amendment.



      (4)   A majority vote of all Council members is required for
passage of all motions.



   (E)   Rule 5 — General Council Rules.



      (1)   The Robert Rules of Parliamentary Law, so far as
applicable, are the rules of the Council, unless they conflict with the rules
herein.



      (2)    A majority of all members of the Council constitutes a
quorum for the transaction of business.  Less than a quorum may meet and
adjourn.



      (3)   No person not a member of the Council or Administration
shall be permitted to address the Council, unless recognized by the presiding
officers or with the approval of a majority vote of the Council.  Upon
recognition, the presiding officer shall instruct the individual of the
proper time, place, and order which they shall take on the meeting agenda.



      (4)   When members desire to address the Council, they shall
address the Mayor as “Mr. or Madam Mayor” and on being recognized may
address the Council.  They shall confine themselves to the subject in debate
and avoid personality.  The Mayor shall recognize any member unless he or
she is not in his or her seat and seeking recognition in the proper way.



      (5)   When the Mayor or any member is addressing the Council,
no member shall engage in private conversation or walk across or leave the
room unnecessarily.



      (6)   No member shall speak more than twice on the same
question without leave of the Council; nor more than once until every member
choosing to speak shall have spoken.  Speeches shall be limited to five
minutes unless further time is granted by the Council; answering questions is
not considered a part of the speaker’s time.



      (7)   Every member must vote upon every question unless
disqualified by law or excused by the Council.  Any member may change his or
her vote before the announcement of the result by the Mayor.



      (8)   If any member violates these rules, the Mayor, or any
member, shall call him or her to order.  In case of a call to order, the
member in control of the floor will yield until the point of order has been
decided.  Wilful or repeated transgressions constitute an offense against
the Council and are punishable by reprimand or removal of office.



      (9)   Any of these rules may be amended or repealed by a
majority vote of all members of the Council.  No vote to amend or repeal
shall be taken until at least two weeks notice of such intention has been
given.

trial. The rules of evidence as allowed by the civil courts of the state

damages, attorney fees, miscellaneous costs of defense and the like.



   (C)   As a condition of this indemnification agreement and its
validity for the benefit of the elected officials and employees, the city
reserves the right to choose and select the attorney to provide the defense
against any such claim for damages on behalf of the elected official,
appointed official or employee to be indemnified; further that, nothing
herein contained shall prevent the elected official, appointed official or
employee from securing counsel of his own choosing, but he or she shall do so
at his or her own expense.



   (D)   This agreement of indemnification shall extend to and for the
benefit of each elected official, appointed official and employee of the town
so long as the claim or lawsuit presented or filed against such elected
official, appointed official or employee shall arise out of and in the course
of the performance of official duties on behalf of the city by the elected
official, appointed official or employee, and at the time of the committing
of the alleged acts, such elected official, appointed official or employee
shall in good faith believe he or she acted within the scope of his or her
authority on behalf of the city and consistent with the policy thereof. Even
though acts alleged to have been committed by the elected official, appointed
official or employee may constitute a violation of IC Chapter 35, this shall
not act as an absolute bar to the effectiveness of this indemnification
agreement, but if such acts are proven to be a violation of IC Chapter 35,
that shall be prima facie evidence that such elected official, appointed
official or employee was not acting in good faith within the scope of his or
her duties and responsibilities for the city, which is, of course, rebuttable
by the elected official, appointed official or employee.



   (E)   If an elected official, appointed official or employee shall
be required to employ an attorney or incur other litigation expenses in the
course of successfully securing an indemnification hereunder, the city shall
further be liable for such attorney fees and litigation expenses of the
elected official, appointed official or employee.

§ 32.08  NEPOTISM AND CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT BY A RELATIVE POLICIES
ADOPTED.



   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a
policy of conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city and
in contracting with the city in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws
effective July 1, 2012 known as IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, respectively.



   (B)   On July 1, 2012 the city shall have a nepotism and a
contracting with a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of
IC 36-1-20.2 (hereinafter “nepotism policy”) and IC 36-1-21 (hereinafter
“contracting with a unit by a relative policy”) and implementation will
begin.



   (C)   The city nepotism policy is hereby established effective July
1, 2012 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of IC 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from
time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out herein. In
addition a copy of IC 36-1-20.2 (Nepotism) in effect on July 1 is attached to
Resolution No. 15-2012.



   (D)   The city contracting with a unit by a relative policy is
hereby established effective July 1, 2012 by adopting the minimum
requirements provisions of IC 36-1-21, and including all future supplements
and amendments thereto which become law from time to time, and making them a
part hereof as if fully set out herein. In addition a copy of IC 36-1-21
(Contracting with a Unit by a Relative) in effect on July 1 is attached to
Resolution No. 15-2012.



   (E)   The city finds that both IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21
specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that are more stringent or
detailed and that more detailed are necessary.



   (F)   The city further finds that a single member of the legislative
body cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation,
grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority
of a majority of the body and therefore without such authority by the
majority he or she will not be in the direct line of supervision. See IC
36-4-6-11 and IC 36-5-2-9.4.



   (G)   The city finds that a single member of governing bodies with
authority over employees in the city cannot act for the governing body to
make work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.



   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the city
are hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.



   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the nepotism policy is a
violation and may result in the discipline, including termination, of an
employee or a transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative
action. An elected or appointed official of the city who fails to abide by or
cooperate with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated
certifications of either the nepotism policy or the contracting with a unit
by a relative policy may be subject to action allowed by law.



   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the contracting with a unit by a
relative policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including
termination, of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed
official of the city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of
either the nepotism policy or the contracting with a unit by a relative
policy may be subject to action allowed by law.



   (K)   The polices created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions:



      (1)   Posting a copy of Resolution No. 15-2012 in its entirety
in at least one of the locations in the city where it posts employer posters
or other notices to its employees;



      (2)   Providing a copy of Resolution No. 15-2012 to its
employees and elected and appointed officials;



      (3)   Providing or posting a notice of the adoption of
Resolution No. 15-2012; or



      (4)   Any such other action or actions that would communicate
the polices established by this section to its employees and elected and
appointed officials. Upon taking any of these actions these policies are
deemed implemented by the city.



   (L)   A copy of the provisions of IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21
effective July 1, 2012 are annexed to Resolution No. 15-2012.



   (M)   Two copies of IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, and as supplemented
or amended, are on file in the Clerk-Treasurer’s office for the city for
public inspection as IC 36-1-5-4 may require.

§ 32.09  DRUG FREE WORKPLACE.




   (A)   Overview.  The City of Crawfordsville, Indiana makes a
commitment to provide employees a safe working environment, to ensure that
employees, equipment and operating practices comply with health and safety
standards, and to maintain public confidence in the city and its employees.
Since the city values each employee, the city offers employees assistance in
dealing with alcohol and drug abuse problems.





   (B)   Policy.





      (1)   The city requires all employees to report for work in a
condition that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient
manner. Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of
alcohol or with prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job
performance.





      (2)   Violation of any provision of this section will be
considered just cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge,
even for a first offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the
policy may be considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to
disciplinary action up to and including discharge.





      (3)   This section and related procedures may be modified by
the city at any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state or
local laws or to better serve the needs of the city.





   (C)   Prohibited drugs.





      (1)   Prohibited drugs are defined as illegal substances,
including controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act
(21 U.S.C. 8120 and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R.
1308.11-1308.15) and prescription controlled substance which have not been
prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes
for the employee. Abuse of prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also
be treated as a substance abuse problem under this section.





      (2)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or
other controlled substances while on the job or on city premises (including
vehicles used for city business). These include but are not limited to
marijuana, cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
barbiturates. Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned
over to the state police and may lead to criminal prosecution.





   (D)   Alcohol.





      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on city premises is
prohibited, unless such use is  non-abusive and is part of an authorized
official event held off city premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used
for city business is strictly prohibited.





      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed
alcoholic beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or
on city premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized, official
event. Possession of such containers in vehicles used for city business is
never authorized.





   (E)   Reporting violations.





      (1)   Employees must as a condition of employment, abide by
the terms of this section and report any conviction to the city under a
criminal drug statute for violations occurring on or off city premises when
conducting city business. Report of a conviction must be made to the city
within five business days after the conviction. The city will then notify the
appropriate contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from
either the employee or from another source.





      (2)   An employee who is involved with off the job illegal
drug activity may be considered in violation of this section. In determining
whether disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the city will
consider the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to any
adverse effect the employee's actions may have on its customers, other
employees, the public, or the city's reputation and image.





      (3)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations
should be directed to the Clerk-Treasurer.





   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.





      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal
responsibility and it is the individual's responsibility to correct
unsatisfactory job performance or behavioral problems caused by alcohol or
drug abuse. In an effort to assist employees, the city will provide various
means for employees and their family members to remain aware of the dangers
of substance abuse in the workplace and to overcome drug and alcohol related
problems.





      (2)   Employees with a personal, alcohol or drug-related
problem are encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved
rehabilitation program upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance
Program, before work performance becomes affected.





      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be
considered a barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action.
Employees will not be disciplined merely because of participation in a
rehabilitation program or excused from the disciplinary consequences of
conduct which is in violation of this section or any other city policies or
job requirements.





      (4)   Any employee identified through a city investigation as
having a substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by
requesting to participate in an approved rehabilitation program.





      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to
determine the course of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will
be offered the opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or
will be subject to discipline.)





   (G)   Testing.





      (1)   The city may conduct random alcohol or drug tests at any
time with or without cause or suspicion to assure compliance with its
drug-free workplace policy.





      (2)   Alcohol or drug tests may be required for employees in
the following circumstances:





         (a)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other
employee behavior is reasonably indicative of substance abuse.





         (b)   During and after participation in a drug or
alcohol rehabilitation program for a reasonable period of time as determined
by the city.





         (c)   When required by law.





      (3)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior
pattern and/or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the
supervisor (with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may
recommend that the employee have a fitness for duty examination by a
physician designated by the city. The physician will determine whether a
fitness for duty examination is necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests
will be required.





      (4)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the
pre-employment physical. The method of testing will be determined by the
city. Applicants who test positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will
not be offered employment. Any questions regarding reapplication
opportunities should be directed to the Clerk-Treasurer.

§ 35.02  ASSESSMENTS FOR WORK PERFORMED BY CITY.



   (A)   Notice of Hearing.  Whenever any officer of the city shall
perform any labor or work on any private lot, tract, or parcel of land in the
city, or in any street, alley or public way adjacent thereto, which work or
labor is authorized to be done by any section of this code, the officer shall
report such work together with the cost thereof to the Council at its next
regular meeting after such work has been done.  The Council shall thereupon
fix its next regular meeting as a date upon which such report shall be heard
and upon which the owners of such property may be heard with reference to the
assessment of the cost of such work against such property.  The
Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare a notice stating the character of such work,
the cost of the same and a description of the property for or on which such
work was done and time for hearing the same, which notice shall be delivered
to the Chief of Police by the Clerk-Treasurer. The Chief of Police shall at
least seven days before the date of such hearing serve such notice on the
owner of such property if he is a resident of the city and known by leaving a
copy of such notice with the owner. If the owner is a nonresident, the Chief
of Police shall serve such notice by sending a copy thereof by registered
mail to the owner, if the address of the owner is known to the Chief of
Police. If the owner is a nonresident and his address unknown, the Chief of
Police shall serve the notice by delivering a copy thereof to the occupant of
the real estate described in the notice, and if such real estate is vacant
and unoccupied and the resident of the owner is unknown, the Chief of Police
shall post a copy of the notice on the property in a conspicuous place, all
of which shall be done at least seven days prior to such hearing. The Chief
of Police shall report the service of notice at the meeting of the Council.



   (B)   Hearing.  At its meeting, the Council shall hear any property
owner whose property is liable to be assessed and is described and mentioned
in such report and shall determine the actual cost of the work. If the charge
is found reasonable, the amount so determined shall be assessed against such
property and shall at once attach and become a lien against the property to
the same extent that taxes are a lien, and shall be collected by the
Clerk-Treasurer as herein provided.



   (C)   Assessment Records.  The Clerk-Treasurer shall maintain a
book known as the “Special Assessment Duplicate,” and he shall enter
therein all such assessments, together with a description of the property
assessed, the name of the owner, and the nature of the work for which such
assessment is made. On the first day of each month the Clerk-Treasurer shall
transcribe all such assessments from his records on to the “Special
Assessment Duplicate.”



   (D)   Lien.  Such assessments shall be done and become delinquent
at the times and on the same terms as taxes are now due and become delinquent
and the Clerk-Treasurer shall, if the same are not paid, proceed to advertise

for the sale of real estate for delinquent taxes by County Treasurers, or the
City Attorney may bring a suit in the name of the city in any court of
competent jurisdiction to foreclose the lien.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 52.001  PURPOSE.



   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the city
and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws
required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resultant sludge;



   (B)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the system; and



   (C)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater
and sludges from the system.

   (B)   In order to effectuate the orderly construction and financing
of the new sewer lines and the extensions of existing sewer lines, the Board
of Public Works and Safety of the city is hereby authorized and directed to
make such financial arrangements with any person, firm or organization as may
desire to extend an existing sewer line or to become a part of such an
extension with other parties and thereby become a user of the city’s sewage
system, as the Board deems desirable and in the best interests of the city,
provided such extension arrangements do not require expenditure of funds in
excess of $25,000 contemplated to be paid or advanced by the city or sewerage
works combined.

regulations of the city regarding the sewage utility, and as provided for
users by this chapter;



      (6)   To insure that any necessary land acquisitions are made
and that all necessary easements are acquired. The Board of Public Works and
Safety is further authorized to thereafter enter into all necessary
agreements for the construction of said sewer extensions and payment
therefor, and to use all of the funds as may be acquired by it from such new
users, and, with approval of the Common Council, such funds as may be
acquired by financing, and such funds of the city as are available for sewer
extension costs;



      (7)   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall require that

§ 52.129  PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment
as required to comply with the most stringent of this subchapter, federal
pretreatment standard, as established by 40 CFR Chapter I, Subpart N, State
standards and permit conditions, and shall achieve compliance with all
national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations, as
specified by the federal pretreatment regulations, and with any other
pretreatment standards by applicable deadlines.



   (B)   Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user’s expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the POTW for review, and shall be approved by the POTW
before construction of the facility. The review and approval of plans and
operating procedures does not relieve the industrial user from complying with
the provisions of this subchapter and permit conditions. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be
reported to and approved by the POTW prior to the industrial user’s
initiation of the changes.



   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard
is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Department
Head shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula
in. 40 CFR 403.6(e).



   (D)   The Department Head is authorized to establish and enforce
specific limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). These limits shall continue to
be developed, as necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance with
the POTW’s NPDES permit or sludge use or disposal practices. Specific
effluent limits shall not be developed or enforced, without individual notice
to persons or groups who have requested such notice and an opportunity to
respond.



   (E)   Where specific prohibitions or limits on pollutants or
pollutant parameters are developed by a POTW, as stated above, such limits
shall be deemed local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of
§ 307(d) of the Act.



   (F)   The pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing
pollutants in excess of the limits stated in § 52.128(B)(10). The above
limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated
otherwise. The department head may impose mass limitations in addition to the
concentration-based limitations above. The city or Department Head may
develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement specific limits
and the requirements of § 52.128. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits
and pretreatment standards for the purposes of § 307(d) of the Act.



   (G)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in
the opinion of the Department Head, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or
sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential
users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Department Head and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning
and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
by the user at their expense.



   (H)   Hauled wastewater. Septic tank waste may be introduced into
the POTW only at locations designated by the Department Head and at such
times as are established by the Department Head. Such waste shall not violate
§ 52.128 or any other requirements established by the Department Head or
city. The Department Head may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits.



   (I)   The Department Head may require haulers of industrial waste to
obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The Department Head may
require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits. The Department Head also may prohibit the disposal of
hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject
to all other requirements of this subchapter.



   (J)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Department Head. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the Department Head. The Department Head may collect samples of
each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The
Department Head may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste
analysis of any load prior to discharge.



   (K)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form
for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address
of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names
and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste.
The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

   (A)   No statement contained in this ordinance shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial user. Furthermore, no special agreement or arrangement shall allow
any industrial user to discharge metals in excess of the maximum allowable
headworks loading (MAHL) of the POTW or conventional pollutants, which will
exceed the POTW’s designed capacity.



   (B)   Also, The Department Head may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, any local limit established by this ordinance.
The mass limits shall not allow any industrial user to discharge metals in
excess of the maximum allowable headworks loading (MARL) of the POTW or
conventional pollutants, which will exceed, the POTW’s designed capacity.
Furthermore, the mass limit shall not be less stringent than federal or state
requirements.

   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable
pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall increase the
use of process water or in any way dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with any
pretreatment standard or requirement. The control authority (as defined in
403.12(a)) may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in
other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

discharge of materials which may interfere with the POTW by developing spill
prevention plans. Facilities necessary to implement these plans shall be
provided and maintained at the owner’s or industrial user’s expense.
Spill prevention plans, including the facilities and the operation
procedures, shall be approved by the POTW before construction of the facility.



   (B)   Industrial users that store hazardous substances shall not
contribute to the POTW after the effective date of this subchapter unless a
spill prevention plan has been approved by the POTW. Approval of such plans
shall not relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and
regulations governing the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous
substances.



   (C)   The POTW shall evaluate each significant industrial user at
least once every two years and other industrial users as necessary, to
determine whether such user needs a plan to control slug discharges. If the
POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a
minimum, the following elements:



      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non
routine batch discharges;



      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;



      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug
discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under §
52.128, with procedures for follow up written notification within five days;



      (4)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control
of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containment of toxic organic pollutants (including
solvents), or measures and equipment for emergency response, or both.

beyond die reasonable control of the Industrial User. An upset does not
include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.



   (B)   Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if
the requirements of division (C) of this section are met.



   (C)   Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An
industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs,
or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify
the cause(s) of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workman like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures;



      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following
information to the POTW and Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five days):



         (a)   A description of the discharge and cause of
noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and time or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue;



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



      (4)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the
industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have
the burden of proof.



      (5)   User responsibility in case of upset. The Industrial
User shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with Pretreatment Standard upon reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where a process in the facility is reduced, lost or fails.

   (A)   Industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment
standard shall submit baseline reports to the POTW in a form prescribed and
furnished by the POTW. The report may utilize data only, so long as the data
provides information, sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.



   (B)   Within 180 days after the effective date of the national
categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after a final administrative
decision has been made upon a categorical determination submission in
accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, industrial users
which are existing sources subject to such national categorical pretreatment
standards and currently discharge to the POTW shall submit a properly
completed baseline report.



   (C)   Under 40 CFR Part 403.12(b), new sources, and sources that
become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the designated city official at least
ninety 90 days before commencement of their discharging, a report which
contains the information contained in 40 CFR part 403.12 (b)(l)-(5). In
addition, the report should indicate the time, date, and place of sampling
and method of analysis. The report shall certify that sampling and. analysis
represents normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
The sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. A new source
shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.



   (D)   In support of the baseline report, the industrial user shall
submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the following
information:



      (1)   Name and address of the facility including the name of
operator and owner;

carried out by such user. This description shall include a schematic process
diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated
processes;



      (4)   Information showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow, in gallon per day, to the POTW from each of the following:



         (a)   Regulated process streams; and



         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the
combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR § 403.6(e);



      (5)   The industrial user shall identify the national
categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and
shall:



         (a)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in. the
discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average
concentrations shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations. This portion of the baseline report must also include
concentrations or masses of pollutants, or both, as appropriate, as well as
documentation of BMP implementation that may be requires as part of the local
limits. See 403.12(b)(5)(h);



         (b)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics.
For all other pollutants, 24 hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control
authority may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial
user that demonstrates the flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such
cases samples may be obtained through time proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged;



         (c)   The user shall take a minimum of one
representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the
requirements of this division;



         (d)   Samples should, be taken immediately downstream
from pretreatment facilities, if such exist, or immediately downstream from
the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are
mixed with the regulated, wastewater prior to Pretreatment the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined
waste stream formula of § 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. When an alternate concentration or mass limit has
been calculated, in accordance with § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW;



      (6)   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed
by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a
qualified professional, indicating whether national categorical pretreatment
standards, prohibited discharge standards, local limits, and state and local
law are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional
pretreatment or O&M is required for the industrial user to meet the national
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law;



      (7)   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to
meet the national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user
will develop and submit a compliance schedule for selection and installation
of adequate technology and equipment. The industrial user will provide the
shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M by
the compliance date established for the applicable national categorical
pretreatment standard.



         (a)   Where the industrial user’s categorical
pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (§ 403.7),
the combined wastestream formula (§ 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally
different factors variance (§ 403.13) at the time the user submits the
report required by division (D)(7)(b) of this section, the information
required by § 52.175(D)(6) and (7) shall pertain to the modified limits.



         (b)   If the national categorical pretreatment standard
for the industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted,
the industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information
provided as a response to divisions (D)(6 ) and (7) of this section and
submit them to the POTW within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.

submitted in response to § 52.175(D)(7):



         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress
in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the user to meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment
standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing final plans, commencing
construction, completing construction, and the like).



         (b)   No increment referred to in § 52.175(D)(8)(a)
shall exceed nine months.



         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the User shall submit a progress
report to the POTW including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established. In no
event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the
POTW.

reported in § 52.175(D)(4) through (6). At the discretion of the Department
Head and in consideration of such factors as local high flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, and the like, the Department Head may agree to alter the
months during which above reports are to be submitted. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice
(BMP) or pollution prevention, alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by POTW or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the user.



   (B)   The POTW may impose mass limitations on users that are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in
other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate, hi such
cases, the report required by division (A) of this section must indicate the
mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the
user. These reports shall, contain the results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested, by the Department Head, of pollutants
contained, therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.



   (C)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the POTW in accordance with the
procedures in 40 CFR 403.6 (c), the report required by § 52.171 shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long term production rate. For
all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by §
52.171 shall include the User’s actual average production rate for the
reporting period.



   (D)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Department Head, the user must include all
monitoring data and results in the report.



   (E)   Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to
the POTW at least once every six months (on dates specified by the control
authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the
pollutants required to be reported by the control authority.



   (F)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.

§ 52.178  MONITORING AND ANALYSIS IN SUPPORT OF SELF-MONITORING
REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   The reports required by this ordinance or 40 CFR 403.12, or
both, must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered
by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in
40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or
where the Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any
other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the Administrator. This
sampling and analysis may be performed by the POTW in lieu of the industrial
user. Where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the
report, the significant industrial user will not be required to submit the
report.



   (B)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicated a
violation, the user shall notify the POTW within 24 hours of a becoming aware
of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the report analysis to the POTW within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required
to resample if:



      (1)   The POTW performs sampling at the industrial user at a
frequency of at least once per month; or



      (2)   The POTW performs sampling at the user between the time
when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.



   (C)   The reports required in § 52.177(A) and (D) shall be based
upon data, obtained, through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. The POTW shall require the
frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by
Industrial Users with applicable pretreatment standards, and requirements.
Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour
composite samples must be obtained, through flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Department Head. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Department Head, the
samples must be representative of the Discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that
facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified, in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a. 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and
oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite
samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Department
Head as appropriate.



   (D)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
90-day compliance reports required in §§ 52.175 and 52.176, a minimum of
four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the POTW may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports § 52.177 require, the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.



   (E)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in
§§ 52.175 through 52.177 monitors the pollutants more recently than
required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.



   (F)   Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The
reports required by section §§ 52.175, 52.176, 52.177, 52.179, and 52.180
must include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR
403.6(a)(2)(h), and be signed by an authorized representative.

§ 52.179  REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.



   Each user must notify the Department Head of any significant changes to
the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least 180 days before the change.



   (A)   The Department Head may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
§ 52.155.



   (B)   The Department Head may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit or modify or revoke and reissue or terminate an existing
wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.

   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a. Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might
cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone
and notify the Department Head of the incident. This notification shall
include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and.
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.



   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Department Head, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this subchapter.



   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of
a discharge described in division (A) of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.



   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the
Department Head immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.

§ 52.181  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS.



   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user under 40 CFR § 403.3(v)(2) must annually submit: the following
certification statement, signed in accordance with the signatory requirements
in § 52.127(C). This certification must accompany any alternative report
required by the control authority:



      Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40
CFR              , I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief that during the period from                            ,
to                          ,                      
[month, days, year]:



      (a)   The facility described as                   
  [facility name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical
industrial user as described in § 403.3(v)(2);



      (b)   The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements during this reporting period; and



      (c)   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of
total categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
This compliance certification is based upon, the following information:



(Ord. 4-1999, passed 3-8-99; Am. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-13-12; Am. Ord.
15-2016, passed 7-11-16)



§ 52.182  WAIVER OF MONITORING REQUIREMENT.



   (A)   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical
industrial user by the Department Head must annually submit the certification
statement in 40 CFR 403.12(q) signed in accordance with 40 CFR
403.12(1)Waiver of Specific Pollutants.



   (B)   The Department Head may authorize an industrial user subject
to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant
regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant
is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present
only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the
pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:



      (1)   The waiver may be authorized, where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from
the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.



      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of
the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no
case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the
waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual
wastewater discharge permit.



      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not
present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of
the facility’s process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the
facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.



      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an
authorized or duly authorized representative of the user as specified in §
52.127, and include the following certification statement:



         I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.



      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from
40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant
was used in the analysis.



      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Department
Head must be included as a condition in the user’s permit. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its
request for the waiver must be maintained by the city for three years after
expiration of the waiver.



      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of
the user’s permit by the Department Head, the industrial user must certify
on each report with the statement in division (B)(4) of this section, that
there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to
activities of the industrial user.



      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be
present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the
user’s operations, the user must immediately:



         (a)   Comply with the monitoring requirements of §
52.178, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Department Head; and



         (b)   Notify the Department Head.



      (9)   This provision, does not supersede certification
processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards,
except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.

§ 52.183  HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION.



   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division (A) need
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged however,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 52.179. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the
self-monitoring requirements of §§ 52.175, 52.176, 52.177, and 52.178.



   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A)
of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified, in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.



   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Department Head, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director,
and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance
within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.



   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.



   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a
permit issued, or any applicable federal or state law.

initial monitoring waiver-the following certification statement is required
to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in
accordance with § 52.164; users submitting baseline monitoring reports under
§ 52.175; users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical
pretreatment standard deadlines under § 52.129; users submitting periodic
compliance reports required by § 52.177, and users submitting an initial
request to forego sampling of a pollutant on the basis of § 52.182. The
following certification statement must be signed by an authorized
representative as defined in § 52.127 Definitions:



      I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are

PART 6:  ENFORCEMENT



§ 52.200  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.



   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this subchapter, or a wastewater
permit or order issued hereunder, the Department Head or his or her agent may
serve upon said user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of the
receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the Department Head. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violation
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.



   (B)   Consent orders. The Department Head is hereby empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurance of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user
responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include compliance
schedules, stipulated fines or remedial actions, and signature of the
Department Head and industry representatives. Consent orders shall be
judicially enforceable and have the same force and effect as administrative
orders issued pursuant to § 52.190(D) below.



   (C)   Show cause order. The Department Head may order any user which
causes or contributes to violation of this subchapter, wastewater permit or
order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested.) at least 10 days
prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive,
general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a. duly notified
industrial user appears as noticed, enforcement action may be pursued as
appropriate.



   (D)   Compliance order. When the Department Head finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate the ordinance or a
permit or order issued, he may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities are properly operated, and compliance is achieved. Orders may also
contain such other requirements as might be reasonable necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management
practices. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



   (E)   Cease and desist orders. When the Department Head finds that
an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this subchapter or
any permit or order used hereunder, the Department Head may issue an order to
cease and desist all illegal or authorized discharges immediately.



      (1)   In an emergency, the order to cease and desist may be
given by telephone.



      (2)   In non-emergency situations, the cease and desist order
may be used to suspend or permanently revoke industrial wastewater discharge
permits.



      (3)   The cease and desist order may order the IU to take such
appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, halting operations and
terminating the discharge.



   (F)   Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of
this subchapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this
subchapter, or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined, in an
amount not to exceed $2,500 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation.
Such assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service
charge and the Department Head shall have such other collection remedies as
he has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties
shall constitute a lien against the individual user’s property. Industrial
users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for Department Head
to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where
the Department Head believes a. request has merit, he or she shall convene a
hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the
industrial user.



   (G)   Emergency suspensions.



      (1)   The Department Head may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.



      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Department Head prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under this ordinance.



   (H)   Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing
to discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit
from the control authority. Any user who violates the following conditions of
this subchapter or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable
state or federal law, or both, is subject to permit termination:



      (1)   Violation of permit conditions.



      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater.



      (3)   Failure to report significant changes hi operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics.



      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises.
Non compliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination
of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§ 52.190(C) of this subchapter why the proposed action should not be taken.

§ 52.201  JUDICIAL REMEDIES.



   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes
into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this
subchapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city or the
Department head, through the City Attorney, may commence an action for
appropriate legal or equitable relief, or both, in the Montgomery Circuit
Court.



   (A)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this subchapter or permit or order
issued hereunder, the city or Department Head, thorough counsel may petition
the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both
(as may be appropriate) which retrains or compels the activities on the part
of the industrial user.



   (B)   Civil penalties.



      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this subchapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of allowed under
state law per violation, per day. In the case of a. monthly or other
long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during
the period of the violation.



      (2)   The POTW may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.



      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court
shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not
limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and
duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through, the user’s
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the
user, and any other factor as justice requires.



      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.



   (C)   Criminal prosecution.



      (1)   Violations - generally.



         (a)   Any industrial user who willfully or negligently
violates any provision of this subchapter or any orders or permits issued
hereunder shall, upon conviction, by guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a
fine not to exceed $2,500 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more
than one year or both.



         (b)   In the event of a second conviction, the user
shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $3,000 per violation per day or
imprisonment for not more than three years or both.



         (c)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications, in any application, record, report, plan
or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
ordinance, individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this ordinance, shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $2,500 per violation, per
day, or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.



   (D)   Annual publication of IU’S in significant noncompliance. The
city must publish, at least annually in the largest daily newspaper
circulated in the service area, a description of those industrial users which
are found to be in significant noncompliance with any provisions of this
subchapter or any permit or order issued, hereunder during the period since
the previous publication.



   (E)   Legal authority. The remedies provided for in this subchapter
are not exclusive. The city, through its Waste Water Department’s
Department Head may take any, all, or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will
generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan.
However, the city may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered totake more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PROCEDURES



§ 52.220  CATEGORIES; PROCEDURES.



   (A)   The following categories of noncompliance of industrial and
commercial users shall be subject to enforcement procedures initiated by the
City of Crawfordsville, Indiana.



      (1)   Failure to submit required reports (baseline monitoring
reports, self-monitoring reports, compliance schedule reports and monthly
reports).



      (2)   Failure to meet interim or final compliance schedule,
scheduled dates.



      (3)   Violation of maximum or average pollutant limitations
for industry specific categories (categorical standards).



      (4)   Violations of prohibited discharges under the National
Pretreatment Standards (40 CFR 403.5).



      (5)   Violations of local limits outlined in this subchapter
as amended.



      (6)   Violations of a major contributor permit.



      (7)   Industrial user’s falsification or tampering of
information submitted to the POTW.



      (8)   Treatment plant upsets and interference’s tracked to
an industrial user.



   (B)   The following shows the enforcement response procedures of the
City of Crawfordsville:



      (1)   Data collection. This process involves the collection of
all available information from inspections, monitoring, reporting, plant
upsets and private complaints.



      (2)   Compliance screening. This process involves the review
of all available information and monitoring data to sort out noncomplying
discharges for appropriate enforcement response. This initial review will
address, as appropriate, compliance with required schedules, compliance with
reporting features or compliance, or both, with applicable categorical
standards and local limitations ordinance.



      (3)   Emergency response. If evaluation of the data reveals an
emergency condition, the city will take whatever means appropriate to bring
the violator into compliance, through immediate telephone contact with the
discharger identifying the problem specifics and requesting immediate
corrective measures. If required more formal measures such as cease and
desist orders, injunctive relief or termination of the service shall be
placed into effect so as to achieve compliance or eliminate the problem
occurrence.



      (4)   Enforcement evaluation for noncompliance. The violations
and conditions identified during the screening processes are reviewed to make
a determination relative to the nature of the violation and the type of
enforcement necessary. This process is accomplished by using the criteria
outlined in the attached Enforcement Response Guide.



      (5)   Insignificant noncompliance. This process consists of
notifying the industrial user by phone of the violation. This call outlines
the specifics of the incident and seeks remedial action and response of the
discharge. The insignificant noncompliance process also includes an
industry’s failure to report slug loading, process changes, and failure to
send monthly self-monitoring reports. Multiple insignificant violations will
result in industry being deemed in significant noncompliance.



      (6)   Significant noncompliance. This process consists of
notifying the industrial user by phone and letter of violation (mailed
certified, return receipt requested). The letter of violation outlines the
specifics of the incident (more serious, chronic types of noncompliance as
set out in the attached Enforcement Response Guide) and seeks remedial action
and respease-of the discharge. The city, through its Waste Water
Department’s Department Head (“Department Head”), will then evaluate
the response reply-to the letter of violation and make a determination as to
whether the discharger has returned to compliance. If compliance is not
achieved the city will initiate formal enforcement action.



      (7)   Formal action.



         (a)   Letter of violation. When the city finds that a
discharger is in violation of the admissible limits or the provisions of a
major contributor permit, the city may require the user to submit for
approval a detailed letter, within ten days, of specific actions which the
user shall take in order to prevent or to correct a violation.



         (b)   Informal meeting. This process consists of setting
up a meeting with the industrial users plant manager and the Department Head
and industrial coordinators, to discuss the action the industry will use to
bring the industrial users back into compliance. An informal meeting can
require a response within ten days. The industry may be allowed up to six
months to come into compliance with this action.



         (c)   Compliance schedule. This schedule is necessary
whenever an industrial user is not meeting their limits at the time of
promulgation of that standard. The schedule contains increments of progress
(i.e., hiring an engineer, completing plans, commencing construction,
completing construction, and the like) which corresponds to specific dates
for their completion. These represent milestone dates for coming into
compliance. The IU is usually allowed six to 12 months to comply with this
action.



         (d)   Issuance of cease and desist orders. When the
Department Head finds that a discharger is in violation of the admissible
limits or the provisions of their permit, he or she may issue an order to
cease and desist to the industrial user, and direct that the user comply with
such provisions:



            1.   Comply immediately;



            2.   Comply with all terms of a compliance
schedule as the city directs; or



            3.   Take appropriate remedial or preventive
action in the event of a threatened violation.



         (e)   Injunction. When the Department Head finds that a
discharger is in violation of the subchapter or the provisions of their
permit, or otherwise causes or threatens to cause a condition of pollution or
nuisance, the city may petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary
or permanent injunction or both, as may be appropriate in restraining the
continuance of such a discharger. These dischargers having significantly
violated a permit, are further subject to fines imposed by the city, in
amount of not less than $1,000 the first clay.



         (f)   Civil penalties.



            1.   Any discharger who is found to have violated
or fails to comply with any enforcement action, the orders, rules,
regulations, pretreatment requirements, and permits issued hereunder, may be
fined a maximum civil penalty of $2,500 but not less than $1,000 for each day
of violation, in addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may
recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, court reporter’s fees
and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the
industry found to have significantly violated the ordinance or the orders,
rules, regulations and permits issued.



            2.   Pretreatment requirements are enforceable
through the civil or criminal penalties, or both, as set forth in divisions
(B)(7)(f) and (B)(7)(g) of these Enforcement Response Procedures, which
include, but are not limited to, the duty to allow or carry out inspections,
entry or monitoring activities; any rules, regulations or orders issued by
the Department Head; any requirements set forth in the control, mechanisms
issued by the Department Head; or any reporting requirements imposed by the
city or these regulations in this part.



         (g)   Criminal penalties.



            1.   Any industrial user who willfully or
negligently violates any provision of this section or any orders or permits
issued hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,500 per violation per day or
imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.



            2.   In the event of a second conviction, the user
shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $3,000 per violation per day or
imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.



         (h)   Termination of service.



            1.   The city, though the City Attorney, may for
good cause suspend the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater
discharge permit of the discharger when it is evident to the city that an
actual or threatened discharger presents or threatens an imminent or
substantial danger to the environment, interference with the operation of the
POTW or violate any pretreatment limits imposed by the ordinance or any
wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to the ordinance. Any discharger
notified of the suspension of the city’s wastewater treatment service or
the discharger’s wastewater discharge permit, or both, shall, within a time
period determined by the city, terminate all discharges.



            2.   At the end of each six month period the
Superintendent or Pretreatment Coordinator will be responsible for reviewing
the industrial files to determine any significant non compliance (SNC’s)
and if so, shall be responsible for seeing that the SNC’s are tabulated on
an annual basis and that the name of all SNC’s are published annually in
the local paper.

§ 52.221  ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE GUIDE.



   This guide is designed to address a broad range of industrial users
violations of monitoring, reporting and treatment requirements that may range
from relatively minor problems to very serious major violations. Each
instance of noncompliance is considered a violation and sound enforcement
policy will be to consider when determining whether a violation is
significant or insignificant.



   (A)   Duration of the violation and compliance history of the IU.



      (1)   The Department Head will review the violation summary to
evaluate the duration of the violation and the compliance history of the
industrial user. Any exceedance of an applicable effluent limit or failure to
meet the deadlines and conditions for reporting, monitoring, or treatment is
a violation. The violation summary will be reviewed for at least one quarter
to determine if the particular types of violations are isolated or recur in
some type of pattern. The Department Head will also consider the enforcement
response that was offered for the previous violations.



      (2)   Isolated violations will usually be attributed to a
relatively simple problem that can be easily corrected. However, when several
minor exceedances occur, either consecutively or several months apart, it may
suggest that operating practices are inadequate to meet the limits and
further pretreatment measures are needed.



      (3)   More aggressive enforcement actions will be taken
against facilities that frequently exceed numerical pretreatment standards
than those that report isolated exceedances (unless the isolated exceedances
are large and troublesome).



   (B)   Apparent good faith of responsible industrial user personnel.
If industrial user personnel appear to be attempting in good faith to comply
with pretreatment requirements, City enforcement actions will obviously be on
a more cooperative level than if industrial user personnel do not appear to
be attempting to comply.



      (1)   City personnel are aware that the Clean Water Act
requires extraordinary efforts to comply with its requirements in a timely
way. Good faith will be measured against this standard:



      Congress clearly expresses the efforts that are expected: The Act
requires industry to take extraordinary efforts if the vital and ambitious
goals of the Congress are to be met. This means that business as usual is not
enough. Prompt, vigorous and in many cases, expensive pollution control
measures must be initiated and completed as promptly as possible. In
assessing the good faith of a discharger, the discharger is to be judged
against these criteria. Moreover, it is an established principle, which
applies to this act, that administrative and judicial reviews are sought on
the discharger’s own time. Legislative history of the Clean Water Act No.
95 14, vol. 3, p. 463



   (C)   Definition of significant noncompliance.



      (1)   Instances of significant noncompliance are defined as
follows:



         (a)   Violations of wastewater discharge limits will be
evaluated based on the magnitude and/or frequency of the violations of
average limits over a six month period. These violations will be evaluated on
the basis of individual parameters and monitoring locations.



            1.   Technical review criteria (TRC).



               a.   Thirty three percent (33%) or more of
the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average
limit by more than the TRC in a six month period.



               b.   Group I for conventional pollutant
(BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease and pH), TRC factor = 1.4 x parameter
limitation value.



               c.   Group II for all other pollutants, TRC
factor = 1.2 x parameter limitation value. (Except pH and temperature).



            2.   Chronic violations are where sixty six
percent or more of the measurements exceed, the same daily maximum limit or
the same average limit in a six month period (any magnitude of exceedance).



            3.   Any other violation of an effluent limit
(average or daily maximum) which the City believes has the potential to cause
or has caused interference with the POTW performance capability (e.g., sludge
loads) or passes through the plant in unacceptable quantities (e.g., exceeds
water quality standards or impairing beneficial uses).



         (b)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, for
planning, engineering, starting construction, completing construction and
attaining final compliance by 60 days or more after the schedule date.



         (c)   Failure to provide reports for compliance
schedules, self-monitoring data, baseline monitoring reports, or permit
application data within 30 days from the due date specified in the ordinance,
permit or enforcement order.



         (d)   Knowingly reporting inaccurate information or
falsifying data.



         (e)   Any other violation or group of violations which
the City or Department Head considers to be significant.



   (D)   The harm caused by the violation. Violations are evaluated to
determine the suspected or measured adverse environmental impact and rated
accordingly.

16-2016, passed 7-11-16)



§ 52.222  TIME FRAMES FOR RESPONSES.



   (A)   All violations will be identified and documented within five
working clays of discovery, and receipt of compliance information.



   (B)   Initial enforcement responses (involving contact with the
industrial user) requesting information on corrective or preventative
action(s) will occur within 15 days of violation detection.



   (C)   Follow up actions will be taken within 60 days of the initial
enforcement response for continuing or reoccurring violations. The response
will include a compliance schedule for all continuing violations.



   (D)   Violations which threaten health, environmental quality, or
property are considered emergencies and will received immediate responses
such as halting the discharge or terminating service.



   (E)   All violations meeting the criteria for significant
noncompliance (SNC) will be addressed with an enforceable order within 30
days of the identification of significant noncompliance.

§ 52.223  STAFF REPRESENTATIVE.



   Listed below are the responsibilities of various personnel involved, in
the screening and collection of data, organization and review of enforcement
actions, and general management of the enforcement response procedures. All
positions involved in the enforcement scheme have attempted to be identified.



   (A)   Pretreatment Coordinator. Review permit applications, develop
and issue discharge permits and control mechanisms. Conduct annual
inspections. Coordinate activities of field personnel. Review noncompliance
reports to determine industries eligible for enforcement action, issue
notices of violation. Respond to spills, accidental discharges, and
complaints.



   (B)   Industrial sampler. Collect industrial samples from
established designated sites within the collection system. Sampling for
backtracking, and determining source of toxic or problem discharges. Deliver
samples to laboratory.

   (B)   This Range of Enforcement Guide addresses a broad range of
pretreatment violations. It is not intended to cover all types of violations.
The responses in this Guide are suggested responses. They are equally
effective. The measure of the effectiveness of an enforcement response
includes:



      (1)   Whether the non-complying source returns to compliance
as expeditiously as possible.



      (2)   Whether the enforcement response establishes the
appropriate deterrent effect for the particular violator and for other
potential violators.



      (3)   Whether the enforcement response promotes fairness to
government treatment as between comparable violators, as well as between
complying and noncomplying parties.



   (C)   This Guide has been developed for guidance and is not intended
to create legal rights or obligations, or to limit the enforcement discretion
of the City of Crawfordsville, Indiana.

§ 52.225  INDUSTRIAL USER INVENTORY.



   (A)   The general pretreatment regulations, 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2),
require all POTWs to identify potential industrial users subject to the
requirements of the pretreatment program and identify the volume and
character of pollutants discharged by the industrial user. The City of
Crawfordsville started their pretreatment program in the mid 1970s and has
updated the program on a regular basis.



   (B)   The city does have all industries with an industrial discharge
permit file do an industrial pretreatment inspection report annually.
Pretreatment personnel go over the report with the industry and do a field
inspection to note any changes in the industry’s process or any plant
expansions. The city also has minor industries file a report to verify there
are no changes in their process. This is done at least once annually.



   (C)   The wastewater plant in Crawfordsville is able to identify new
sources by:



      (1)   Working closely with the City Planner;



      (2)   Working with the Chamber of Commerce;



      (3)   Notified by Sewer Billing Office of any changes in
company name or noticeable change in water usage;



      (4)   Added name to billing list;



      (5)   Sewer connections or inspections;



      (6)   Contacted by potential industry;



      (7)   Site visit;



   (D)   All new industries subject to pretreatment requirements are
issued an industrial discharge permit and added to the master list of
regulated facilities. This information is provided to IDEM on a quarterly
basis (part of the quarterly report). All permitted industries are divided
into categorical and non-categorical groups. This is clarified on the
quarterly report along with what category the industry is listed. All
permitted industries are considered significant industries under the City of
Crawfordsville Pretreatment Program and are subject to all program
requirements.



   (E)   Crawfordsville is able to identify the volume and character of
pollutants discharge by the industry by:



      (1)   Scheduled annual inspections;



      (2)   Unscheduled inspections;



      (3)   Industry’s requirements to report changed discharges;



      (4)   Observations from field personnel;



      (5)   Information submitted on industrial discharge permit
application;



      (6)   Review of self-monitoring; and



      (7)   Review of surveillance done quarterly.



   (F)   Updated information is put in each industry’s file and gone
over with IDEM on their annual audit.

contamination, pollution nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.



(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)



§ 53.15  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.



   (A)   Prohibition of illegal discharges.  No person shall discharge
or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters
containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards, other than storm water.  The
commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:



      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge
prohibitions established by this subchapter:  water line flushing or other
potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream
flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not
including active groundwater dewatering systems) crawl space pumps, air
conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles,
natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated -
typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities and any other
water source not containing pollutants.



      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by an authorized
representative of the city as being necessary to protect public health and
safety.



      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a
verbal notification to the city prior to the time of the test.



      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water
discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, providing that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.



   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections.



      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued
existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.



      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation,
illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time
of connection.



      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this
subchapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or
allows such a connection to continue.



(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)



§ 53.16  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.



   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency
situations.  The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.



   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.  Any
person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have their
MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge.  The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of
its MS4 access.  The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration
and hearing.  A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the city.



(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)



§ 53.17  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.



   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit.  Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the city prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.



(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)



§ 53.18  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.



   (A)   Applicability.  This section applies to all facilities that
have storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.



   (B)   Access to facilities.



      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter.  If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the city.



      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge storm water and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.



      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge.



      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense.  All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall
not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such an access shall be borne by the
operator.



      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of
this subchapter.  A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits
an offense if the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this subchapter.



      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this subchapter or any issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.



(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)



§ 53.19  REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   The city will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system or waters
of the United States.  The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs.  Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional
structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.  These BMPs
shall be a part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.



(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)



§ 53.20  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.



   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system
or waters of the United States said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release.  In the event
of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services.  In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person
shall notify the city in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the
next business day.  Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed
by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days
of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such

STORM DRAINAGE CONTROL



§ 53.40  TITLE.



   This subchapter shall be known and may be sited and referred to as the
“Stormwater Drainage Control Ordinance, City of Crawfordsville, Indiana”
and shall hereafter be referred to as “this subchapter.”



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.41  PURPOSE.



   (A)   This subchapter establishes standards for the planning and
design of drainage systems and stormwater control facilities within the
jurisdictional area of the City of Crawfordsville. The purpose of this
subchapter is to control stormwater drainage facilities, grading, excavation,
clearing, and other alterations of the land in order to limit the dangers of
personal injury or property damage that may be caused by stormwater runoff.
In addition, these provisions are needed to secure the eligibility for flood
insurance under Public Law 1016 and thereby promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Crawfordsville.



   (B)   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels
serving the City of Crawfordsville may not have sufficient capacity to
receive and convey stormwater runoff, as land changes from agricultural or
open use to a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposits of
sediment from developments during and after construction activities can
reduce capacities of storm sewer drainage systems and result in damages to
the receiving water bodies. Therefore, it shall be the policy of the City of
Crawfordsville that the storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff
shall be required of all new development, and redevelopment and other new
construction in the City of Crawfordsville’s jurisdiction. The release rate
of stormwater from developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from the
land area in its present land use, as further defined in § 53.58.



   (C)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of
outlets for stormwater runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements
for stormwater drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project. It
is recommended that each proposed project be discussed with the
Superintendent of Stormwater for the City of Crawfordsville at the earliest
practical time in the planning stage.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.42  APPLICABILITY.



   This subchapter shall apply to all development that requires City of
Crawfordsville location permits and official review and approval of the
Crawfordsville Planning Department within the city’s corporate limits. This
subchapter regulates:



   (A)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development or
redevelopment of lands located within the City of Crawfordsville’s
corporate limits.



   (B)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.



   (C)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.



   (D)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater
drainage facilities and systems.

§ 53.43  EXEMPTION PROCEDURE; APPEALS.



   (A)   The Superintendent of the Crawfordsville Stormwater Department
hereby has the authority to grant exemptions and to modify and/or waive any
and all the requirements of this subchapter and its associated technical
standards, pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. It shall not
be necessary for an applicant for a project to request specifically a waiver
or reduction of the requirements of this subchapter; instead the
Superintendent shall review each proposed project and grant a waiver or
modification as set forth below.



   (B)   Promptly upon the filing of a building permit or other such
application with the Planning Department, and as part of the routine
processing of all such applications within the city, the Superintendent will
review the project plans and, if advisable in his or her discretion, perform
a site inspection of the proposed project. The Superintendent will then
complete a stormwater review and forward it to the Planning Department. The
Superintendent may discuss the applicability of various provisions of this
subchapter and other applicable laws and regulations with regard to the
project with the City Engineer, the City Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) Operator, the City Attorney, and any other city official. The
form and contents of a storm water review may be as simple or as detailed as
necessary to address the particular impact of each project, but the review
shall be in writing and made available to the applicant.



   (C)   If as a result of initial review of the application and any
consultations, the Superintendent determines that one or more state, federal
or local laws or regulations preclude waiver or modification of this
subchapter or any part of it, then he or she shall so notify the applicant in
writing and deny the request for a waiver or modification.



   (D)   If as a result of the initial stormwater review, the
Superintendent determines that the project may have an adverse impact on
stormwater quantity and runoff and/or on stormwater quality, then the
Superintendent will request a pre-construction, pre-building permit approval
meeting between representatives of the city and the applicant (or the
applicant’s representatives). This meeting shall be scheduled in an
expedient manner and may be required by the Superintendent to be held
on-site. At or prior to this meeting, the applicant should provide enough
information to address the concerns of the Superintendent shown in the
review, and if the applicant fails to address those concerns to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent, a waiver will not be granted.



   (E)   If as a result of the initial stormwater review, however, the
Superintendent determines that the project will have no or de minimus impact
on stormwater quantity and runoff and/or on stormwater quality, then the
Superintendent may issue a written waiver of the requirements of this
subchapter. However, such a waiver may be revoked at any time if it is shown
that the applicant or the applicant’s agents exceeded one or more
parameters of the original building permit application submitted to the city
and/or did not follow the plans submitted to the Superintendent for review.



   (F)   An applicant who believes a waiver or modification should have
been granted by the Superintendent may appeal the Superintendent’s adverse
decision to the Stormwater Board, in which case the Board shall review the
Superintendent’s decision and hear the arguments and review documentation
from the Superintendent and the applicant (or their representatives), and
then the Board may grant a waiver or modification. An applicant who believes
the Board erred may have recourse to the courts as with any other adverse
administrative decision.

§ 53.44  CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.



   The provisions of this subchapter shall be deemed as additional
requirements to minimum standards required by other city, state or federal
regulations. In the case of conflicting requirements, the most restrictive
shall apply.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.45  COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.



   (A)   In addition to the requirements of this subchapter, compliance
with the requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances for submission
and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement plans,
building permits, zoning approvals, and similar matters, and compliance with
applicable State of Indiana statues and regulations shall be required.



   (B)   The following approvals, if applicable, must be obtained
before city approval on the detailed design drainage plan will be granted:



      (1)   Permit for Construction in a Floodway, Chapter 318, Acts
of 1945, as amended from the State of Indiana, Department of Natural
Resources. This permit is required if the drainage area for the affected
stream is one square mile or greater and is required for any construction in
a floodway and any works for flood control.



      (2)   Section 404 Permit, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act,
and 33 CFR Part 330 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This permit is
required for projects that may involve the discharge of dredged or fill
material into waters of the United States.



      (3)   Section 401 Water Quality Certification from the State
of Indiana, Department of Environmental Management. This permit is required
for any project that has a Section 404 Permit from the Corps of Engineers.



      (4)   Rule 5 Compliance, NPDES General Permit, and 327 IAC 15.
For any construction activity on a site of one acre or more, proof of
compliance with these requirements must be provided. A notice of intent
letter and fee must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management and an erosion control plan must be submitted to the Montgomery
County Soil and Water Conservation District Office.



      (5)   Rule 6, NPDES General Permit, 327 IAC 15-6, Storm Water
Discharge Associated with Industrial Activity. Rule 6 establishes
requirements for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity. A
notice of intent and fee must be submitted to the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management by the industrial facility. A stormwater pollution
prevention plan must be developed and implemented within 365 days from the
date the NOI was submitted. An annual reporting and sampling program must
also be submitted to IDEM as a part of this process.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.46  STORMWATER CONTROL POLICY.



   (A)   It is recognized that the streams and drainage channels
serving the drainage needs of the City of Crawfordsville may not have
sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff resulting from
continued development. To address this condition, the storage and controlled
release rate of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for any
development, redevelopment and new construction located within the City of
Crawfordsville. All drainage in the developed area must be confined and
maintained on site through perimeter structures or appurtenances including
swales and inlets, detention or retention storage basins.



   (B)   No improvement location permit will be issued by the city for
construction or extension of any proposed or existing building until the
required drainage plans have been approved in writing by the Superintendent
of Stormwater, except for the following exemptions:



      (1)   Extension or replacement of any existing building that
does not increase the existing rate of runoff.



   (C)   The release rate of storm water from development,
redevelopment, and new construction may not exceed a two-year pre-developed
rainfall event rate for a ten-year post-developed storm, or a ten-year
pre-developed outlet rate for a 100-year post-developed storm.



   (D)   The developer must submit to the city detailed computations of
runoff before and after development, redevelopment, or new construction that
demonstrates that runoff will not be increased. Hydrograph techniques and
computer modeling methods used to determine stormwater runoff shall be proven
and accepted methods, and will be subject to approval of the Superintendent
of Stormwater.



   (E)   These computations must show that the peak runoff rate after
development for the 100-year return period storm of critical duration must
not exceed the ten-year return period pre-development peak runoff rate. The
critical duration storm is that storm duration that requires the greatest
stormwater storage. The top of the embankment must provide a two-foot
freeboard above the elevation of the 100-year routed pool level. In addition,
the emergency spillway must be designed so that it becomes operational at or
above the elevation of the routed 100-year storm. The 100-year storm must be
routed through the pond with the primary spillway inoperative.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.47  DETERMINATION OF DRAINAGE IMPACT AREAS.



   (A)   The Planning Director is authorized, but is not required, to
classify certain geographical areas as drainage impact areas and to enact and
promulgate regulations that are generally applied. In determining drainage
impact areas, the Planning Director shall consider such factors as
topography, soil type, and carrying capacity of existing regulated drains and
distance from adequate drainage facility. The following areas shall be
designated as drainage impact areas, unless good reason for not including
them is presented to the Board of Public Works.



      (1)   A floodway fringe as designated on the Federal Emergency
Management Agency’s Floodway Maps as land within 75 feet of the top of each
bank of any regulated or legal drain.



   (B)   In situations where there is not available land to provide an
adequate outlet, taking into consideration the capacity and depth of the
outlet, the location may be designated as a drainage impact area by approval
of the Planning Director. Special requirements for development within and
drainage impact area shall be included in the approval.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.48  RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.



   The Superintendent of Stormwater, inspector or other duly authorized
employee of the city, upon reasonable notice to any person who is owner,
tenant, or occupant of any real estate, is empowered to enter, upon
presentation of proper credentials, upon or through any premises for the
purpose of carrying out the objectives of this subchapter. This right of
entry shall include, but not be limited to, any equipment necessary clearance
before entry and not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the inspector in
carrying out the inspection. The right of entry shall exist at any time.

§ 53.50  INFORMATION SUBMISSION.



   (A)   Applicants must submit drainage plans for review and approval
prior to the initiation of any land alteration on the site. Local drainage
review as part of the land alteration process shall typically be accomplished
as a two-step process, in conjunction with the platting of land. A general
drainage plan, including submittal of drainage calculations, and information
for the entire parent tract shall be required with submittal of a primary
play. A detailed design drainage plan shall be submitted with the secondary
plat. In addition to the information required by the platting process, other
information shall be required, as noted in this section.



   (B)   In the case where the site has already been plated, but
development plan approval has not been granted, the drainage review process
shall be completed in conjunction with the initial site development plan
application. In addition to the information required by the development
review process, other information shall be required, as noted in this section.

§ 53.54  DEVIATIONS FROM APPROVED PLANS.



   (A)   Substantial deviations from approved plans and specifications
shall not be made after the Board of Public Works grants formal plan
approval. Written application for deviation(s) from approved plans shall be
filed in duplicate with the Superintendent of Stormwater or City Engineer and
approved by the Board of Public Works, prior to implementation of the
revision or change(s). Copies of the revisions or changes, if approved, shall
be attached to the original plans and specifications.



   (B)   Examples of substantial deviations from the approved drainage
plan shall include, but are not limited to, the following:



      (1)   Pipe size changes.



      (2)   Pipe grade changes (because of their affect on the
hydraulic capacity of the stormwater facility).



      (3)   At the discretion of the Superintendent of Stormwater,
stormwater facility horizontal alignment changes greater than five feet.
Where the proposed stormwater facility has been required to be constructed
within a right-of-way or stormwater easement, horizontal changes that place
the stormwater facility outside of the limits of the right-of-way or
stormwater easement area will not be accepted by the city. Storm drains
constructed on privately owned property, outside of public rights-of-way or
stormwater easements may vary more than five feet in the horizontal
alignment, provided the hydraulic performance of the facility has not been
altered, and no other portion of the approved construction plans has been

structures or streets to a greater risk of flooding than under approved plans.



      (6)   Changes to drainage swales or ditches within
right-of-ways, or on easements dedicated to the city.



      (7)   Other changes deemed substantial by the Superintendent
of Stormwater. If an applicant does not agree with the decision of the
Superintendent of Stormwater, as it relates to this section, the applicant
may request review and action by the Stormwater Board.

§ 53.58  AMOUNT OF RUNOFF TO BE ACCOMMODATED.



   Various parts of a drainage facility must accommodate runoff water as
follows:



   (A)   Street drainage. The street drainage system, such as inlets,
catch basins, street gutters, swales, sewers and small channels that collect
stormwater must accommodate peak runoff from a ten-year return period storm.



      (1)   The allowable spread of water on collector and arterial
streets is limited to maintaining two clear ten-foot moving lanes of traffic.
One lane is to be maintained on local streets.



      (2)   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than 30 cubic
feet per second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50-year
return period storm within the drainage easement.



      (3)   Culverts shall be designed to carry, without overtopping
the roadway, the 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms for local, collector, and
arterial streets, respectively.



      (4)   Culverts shall be capable of accommodating a peak runoff
from a 50-year return period storm when crossing under a road that is
classified as an arterial or collector. In no case shall a new culvert be
designed to carry less than the existing capacity of the channel.



   (B)   Overall drainage system. The overall drainage system shall be
designed in accordance with the most current Indiana Department of Natural
Resources standards. Storm sewers and swales/ditches shall be designed for a
ten-year storm.



      (1)   Pre-developed runoff rates. Pre-developed runoff rates
shall be based on the existing land use at the time the new development is
being planned.



      (2)   General drainage system design standards. The drainage
system shall be constructed and installed in accordance with plans and
specifications approved by the Board of Public Works. All streets shall have
a storm drainage system consisting of curbs, gutters and storm sewers, unless
a waiver is granted to the applicant.



      (3)   Storm sewer design standards. All public storm sewers
shall conform to the design standards and other requirements contained in
this subchapter and per the standard detail sheets as approved by the Board
of Public Works.



         (a)   Manning Equation. The hydraulic capacity of storm
sewers shall be determined using Manning’s Equations:



            V=(1.486/n) R2/3 Sl/2 where,



            V = mean velocity of flow in feet per second



            R = the hydraulic radius in feet



            S = the slope of the energy grade line in feet per
foot



            n = roughness coefficient



            The hydraulic radius, R is defined as the cross
sectional area of flow divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted
perimeter. Typical “n” values are listed in the table below. Roughness
coefficient (n) values for other sewer materials can be found in standard
hydraulics texts and references.

PVC Pipe
 
0.011-0.015



 



         (b)   Velocity. The minimum pipe flow should not be less
than two and one-half  feet per second. The maximum pipe velocity is to be
15 feet per second. However, outlet velocities in excess of five feet per
second will necessitate energy dissipation measures, as approved by the City
Engineer.



         (c)   Minimum pipe size. The minimum pipe size of all
storm sewers shall be 12 inch diameter. An orifice plate, weir, or other
devices, subject to approval of the City Engineer shall control the rate of
release for stormwater storage, where the pond’s primary spillway pipe will
not limit the required rate of release.



         (d)   Grade. Storm sewer grade shall be such that, in
general, a minimum of two feet of cover is maintained over the top of the
pipe. Pipe cover less than the minimum may be used only upon approval of the
City Engineer. Uniform slopes shall be maintained between inlets, manholes,
and inlets to manholes. Final grade shall be set with full consideration of
the capacity required, sedimentation problems, and other design parameters.
Minimum and maximum allowable slopes shall be those capable of producing
velocities of two and one-half and five feet per second, respectively, when
the storm sewer is flowing full.



         (e)   Alignment. Storm sewers shall be straight between
manholes, insofar as possible. Where long radius curves are necessary to
conform to street layout, the minimum radius of curvature shall be no less
than 100 feet for sewers 42 inches and larger in diameter. Deflection of pipe
sections shall not exceed the maximum deflection recommended by the pipe
manufacturer. The deflection shall be uniform and finished installation shall
follow a smooth curve.



         (f)   Manholes. Manholes shall be installed to provide
access to continuous underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection
and maintenance. Manholes shall be provided at the following locations:



            1.   Where two or more storm sewers converge;



            2.   At the point of beginning or at the end of a
curve, and at the point of reverse curvature (PC, PT, PRC).



            3.   Where pipe size changes;



            4.   Where an abrupt change in alignment occurs;



            5.   Where a change in grade occurs;



            6.   At suitable intervals in straight sections of
the storm sewer. The maximum distance between storm sewer manholes shall be
300 feet for pipe 12 inches through 42 inches, and 500 feet for pipes larger
than 42 inches.



         (g)   Inlets. Inlets or drainage structures shall be
utilized to collect surface water through grated openings and convey it to
storm sewers, channels or culverts. Inlet design and spacing shall be in
accordance with INDOT’s Road Design Manual or other appropriate design
procedures, but in no case may be spaced more than 500 feet apart. Inlets
shall be sized and each individual inlet shown on plans. The inlet grate
opening provided must be adequate to pass the design ten-year flow with 50%
percent of the sag inlet areas clogged. An overload channel from sag inlets,
so that the maximum depth of water that might be ponded in the street sag
shall not exceed six inches.



         (h)   Protection of embankment. Erosion protection shall
be provided for the primary outlet and emergency spillway so that the
stormwater facility embankment will be adequately protected. The location of
the emergency spillway shall be in undisturbed material, unless otherwise
approved by the City Engineer.



         (i)   Outlet conduit. The minimum allowable size for the
primary outlet conduit, from the stormwater facility, shall be 12 inches. If
further restriction of the outlet conduit is required, the restriction shall
be made to the inlet end of the conduit.



         (j)   Outlet velocity. In those instances where the
discharge velocity from the primary outlet or emergency spillway is excessive
in the opinion of the City Engineer, energy dissipation may be required. In
general, outlet velocities in excess of five feet per second in earth/grassed
channels are considered excessive.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.59  INDIVIDUAL SITE DRAINAGE.



   All drainage in a developed area must be confined and maintained on
site through perimeter structure including swales and inlets, and shall be
channeled though the stormwater storage area.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.60  OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS.



   (A)   Manning Equation. Open channel design shall be based on the
Manning Equation.



   (B)   Minimum size. The required channel cross-section and grade are
determined by the design capacity, the material in which the channel is to be
constructed, and the requirements for maintenance. A minimum depth may be
required to provide adequate outlets for subsurface drains, tributary ditches
or streams. The channel grade shall be such that the velocity in the channel
is high enough to prevent siltation but low enough to prevent erosion.
Velocities less than one and one-half  feet per second should be avoided
because siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel
cross-section. Developments through which the channel is to be constructed
must be considered in design of the channel section.



   (C)   Side slopes. Side slopes for grass-lied channels shall be no
steeper than three to one. Side slopes for rock riprap-lined channels shall
be no steeper than one and one-half to one. Channels with vertical walls may
be constructed, with approval of the City Engineer.



   (D)   Drainage of vegetated waterways. Vegetated waterways that have
less than 1.5% slope, are subject to low flows of long duration or where wet
conditions prevail shall be drained with an underdrain or low flow structure.
Lines may be outletted through a drop structure at the end of the waterway,
or though a standard tile outlet.



   (E)   Longitudinal slopes. Longitudinal slopes shall be grass-lined
and, for channel length of 400 feet or less, the minimum standard
longitudinal slope shall be 1.3%. If the slope is less than 1.3% but at least
1%, then an underdrain is required. If the slope is less than 1%, a paved
concrete swale as approved by the City Engineer shall be required. For
channel length greater than 400 feet, the minimum standard longitudinal slope
shall be 1%. For slopes between 1% and 1.3%, an underdrain is required.



   (F)   Alternative swale/ditch treatments. Alternative open channel
treatments shall be subject to approval of the City Engineer.



   (G)   Channel stability. All swales shall be blanketed or fiber
mulched, so erosion control extends completely to the top of the bank.



   (H)   Effects of channel improvements. The effect of channel
improvements on existing culverts, bridges, buried cables, pipelines and
inlet structures for surface and subsurface drainage on the channel being
improved and laterals there to shall be evaluated to determine the need for
modification or replacement. Culverts and bridges which are modified or added
as part of channel improvement projects shall meet reasonable standards for
the type of structure, and shall have a minimum capacity equal to the design
discharge or governmental agency design requirements, whichever is greater.



   (I)   Disposition of spoil. Spoil material resulting from clearing,
grubbing and channel excavation shall not stay on the site unless it is to be
used as part of the approved grading plan. In no case shall spoil be
deposited in the floodway. Excavated materials, when stored temporarily
on-site, must be handled in accordance with the Rule 5 Erosion Control Plan
and the erosion control measures included in the construction plans.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.61  CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS.



   (A)   Construction. Specifications shall be in keeping with the
current standards on file with the City of Crawfordsville, and shall describe
the requirements for proper installation of the project to achieve its
intended purpose.



   (B)   Street drainage. Street drainage shall be divided to drain on
both sides of the street, and shall comply with the city’s approved
standard details, as adopted by the Board of Public Works.



   (C)   Materials.



      (1)   Storm sewers. Pipes shall comply with the city’s
approved standard detail. End treatments shall be slope walls or reinforced
concrete.



      (2)   Open channels. Materials acceptable for use as channel
lining are grass, revetment rip-rap, concrete, hand-laid rip-rap, pre-cast
cement concrete rip-rap, grouted rip-rap, and gabions. Lining materials shall
receive specific approval of the City Engineer. Materials shall comply with
the latest edition of INDOT’‘s Standard Specifications.



   (D)   Special hydraulic structures. Special hydraulic structures,
including junction chambers, drop manholes, inverted siphons, stilling
basins, energy dissipation structures, and the like shall be used only if
they match one of the city’s approved standard details or if approved by
the City Engineer.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.62  STORMWATER STORAGE.



   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect
to the temporary storage of stormwater runoff:



   (A)   Acceptable storage methods. Increased stormwater runoff
resulting from a proposed development should be detained on-site by the
provision of appropriate stormwater storage ponds. Storage of stormwater
shall not be allowed to occur within any swales unless such storage is part
of a plan approved by the Planning Director and Superintendent of Stormwater.



   (B)   Design storm. Design of stormwater storage facilities shall be
based on a return period of once in 100 years. The storage volume and outflow
rate shall be sufficient to handle stormwater runoff from a critical duration
storm, as defined in this subchapter.



   (C)   Allowable release rate.



      (1)   The allowable release rate of stormwater originating
from a proposed development shall not exceed a two-year pre-developed
rainfall event rate for a ten-year post-developed storm, and as described by
the determination of storage volumes through hydrograph methods. In any case,
the system must assure adequate positive outfall to a recognized waterway or
drainage facility.



      (2)   In the event that the natural downstream channel of the
storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided
above, then one of the following alternative solutions must be selected:



         (a)   The allowable release rate shall be reduced to
that rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or
storm sewer system, and additional storage volume determined by the Board
shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity
of the receiving sewers or waterways.



         (b)   The developer must correct the downstream
restriction.



      (3)   If more than one stormwater basin is involved in the
development of the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable
release rate from any one basin shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of
its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of
the restriction.



         (a)   Drainage system overflow design. Drainage systems
shall have adequate capacity to convey the stormwater runoff from all
upstream tributary areas through the development under consideration for a
storm of 100-year design return period calculated on the basis of the
upstream land in its present state of development.



         (b)   The Stormwater Utility Board, the City Engineer or
Superintendent of Stormwater may approve, upon review of evidence submitted
by the developer, an allowance, equivalent to the reduction of low rate
provided, for upstream storage.



         (c)   When such upstream storage and release rates have
previously been approved by the Board and evidence of its construction can be
shown.



         (d)   Determination of storage volume - hydrograph
method. For developments requiring that stormwater storage be provided, the
hydrograph methods shall be used to determine the required volume of
stormwater storage.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.63  GENERAL STORMWATER BASIN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   Basins shall be constructed to detain temporarily the stormwater runoff
that exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this subchapter. The
volume of storage provided in these basins shall be sufficient to control
excess runoff from the 100-year storm.



   (A)   For on-site watershed, the 100-year, 24-hour hydrograph for
the tributary drainage area, representing fully developed conditions of the
watershed, and corresponding runoff coefficients and travel times, shall be
routed through the stormwater basin.



   (B)   Runoff for upstream off-site development will flow through the
site, but will not be stored. The 100-year run-off under existing upstream
conditions shall be determined, and this shall be used in sizing the
emergency spillway for the pond.



   (C)   The routing shall determine the maximum 100-year pool
elevation; the maximum routed discharge, and the maximum pond storage
requirement for the design storm. The maximum routed discharge shall be equal
to or less than the ten-year frequency peak discharge from the watershed
under pre-developed conditions.



   (D)   The ten-year 24-hour hydrograph for the fully developed
watershed must be routed through the stormwater pond and have a routed peak
discharge rate not to exceed the pre-developed two-year peak discharge rate.



   (E)   The lip of the emergency spillway shall be established at or
above the routed 100-year pool elevation. The pond embankment shall have a
minimum freeboard of two feet between the maximum routed 100-year pool
elevation and the top of the facility embankment.



   (F)   The emergency spillway shall be designed by routing the
100-year, 24-hour hydrograph through the pond assuming that the primary
spillway is not operating. This storm should be routed through the basin with
the maximum pool level below the top of the embankment.



   (G)   All stormwater storage facilities shall be separated by a
minimum of 50 feet from any primary building or structure to be occupied. A
20-feet wide easement around the perimeter of the pond, measured from the top
of bank shall be required. Off-site easements may be required by the city,
based on the location of primary and emergency pond spillways, and their
proximity to adjacent property.



   (H)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as
simply as possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or
attention for proper operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or
planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined
maximum authorized peak flow rate. This facility should be designed to allow
easy access from the embankment to remove trash and debris from the outlet
structure.



   (I)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall
be provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in emergency
conditions should the primary spillway become completely or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention. All stormwater storage
facilities shall be provided with an emergency spillway.



   (J)   Sod or other vegetative cover acceptable to the City Engineer
shall be provided throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut
regularly at approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as
required unless designated as a wildflower or prairie area.



   (K)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall
be performed regularly  by the designated body (e.g., developer or
homeowner’s association) to assure continued operation in conformance to
design.



   (L)   A report shall be submitted to the Office of the City Engineer
describing the proposed development, the current land-use conditions, the
method of hydraulic and hydrologic analysis used (including any assumptions
or special conditions), the results of the analysis, and the recommended
drainage control facilities. Hydraulic and hydrologic calculations, including
input and output files, shall be included as appendices to the report.



   (M)   Drainage easement.  All stormwater storage facility should be
located in a drainage/utility easement so that the city can access the
facility under emergency conditions.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.64  DRY-BOTTOM BASIN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   Dry-bottom stormwater storage basins shall only be permitted if
approved by the Board of Public Works as a waiver, under the conditions of
this subchapter. Stormwater storage facilities, which are designed to have
dry bottoms, must be designed to include under drains, to drain the bottom of
the stormwater storage facility, so that the facility can be maintained. In
addition, the bottom of the facility shall be designed to have a longitudinal
slope of 1.3% and traverse grade to the outlet, so that the facility will
empty, leaving no ponded water. Detention basins with less than 1% must be
provided with subsurface drainage or paved gutters. Recreation facilities,
aesthetic qualities, open space or secondary use shall be considered in
planning in detention facilities. Max planed depth of storm water stored with
out a permanent pool shall not exceed four feet.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)



§ 53.65  WET-BOTTOM BASIN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   Where part of a stormwater basin will contain a permanent pool of
water, all the items required for stormwater storage shall apply except that
the system of drains with a positive gravity outlet required to maintain a
dry-bottom basin will not be required. A controlled positive outlet will be
required to maintain the design water level in the wet-bottom basin and
provide required temporary storage above the design water level (permanent
pool). However, the following additional conditions shall apply:



   (A)   Stormwater basins shall be designed in compliance with the
City of Crawfordsville’s standard detail.



   (B)   In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be
considered stable.



   (C)   A safety ledge shall be provided per the city’s standard
detail must be installed in all ponds.



   (D)   There shall be two feet of freeboard from the routed 100-year
pool to the top of bank.



   (E)   There shall be a minimum easement width around the pond of 20
feet, with an additional easement area adjacent to the pond large enough to
serve as a staging area for maintenance equipment such as dredges and dump
trucks.



   (F)   Periodic maintenance is required in ponds to control weed and
larval growth. The pond shall also be designed to provide for the easy
removal of sediment that will accumulate during periods of pond operation. A
means of maintaining the designed water level of the pond during prolonged
periods of dry weather is also required.



   (G)   Aeration facilities to enhance and maintain pond water quality
shall be provided for all ponds with a surface area of less than one acre.



   (H)   Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these
aeration facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans.
Agreements for the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities
shall be prepared to the satisfaction of the Board.



   (I)   If fish are to be maintained in the pond, a minimum depth of
approximately ten feet shall be maintained over at least 25% of the pond
area. The remaining pond areas shall have no extensive shallow areas.



   (J)   If fish are not to be maintained, the minimum depth shall be
with eight feet over at least 25%  of the pond at permanent water level, or
where a limiting layer prevents excavation to that depth, a minimum of six
feet over at least 50% of the area shall be required.



   (K)   In excavated ponds, the underwater side slopes in the pond
shall be stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be
considered stable.



   (L)   A safety ledge a minimum of six feet in width and a 10:1 slope
is required and must be installed in all ponds approximately 30 inches below
the permanent water level.



   (M)   Erosion control measures must be installed to prevent erosion

VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   The Stormwater Superintendent and/or his or her duly
authorized designees, may issue a civil stormwater drainage and sediment
control violation to a person who commits a civil stormwater drainage and
sediment control violation to the legal owner, the contract vendee, or any
person or entity with a possessory interest in the real estate upon which the
violation occurs. The citation may be served by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a placement in a conspicuous place on the property
where the violation occurs and shall serve as notice to a person that he or
she has committed a civil stormwater drainage and sediment control ordinance
violation.



   (B)   No citation shall be issued for the first offense unless the
person who commits a civil stormwater drainage and sediment control
violation, or the legal owner, the contract vendee, or any person or entity
with a possessory interest in the real estate upon which the violation occurs
has been issued a warning ticket before the issuance of the citation to allow
said person to correct the violation to come into compliance with the
prescribed stormwater drainage and sediment control ordinance or regulations.



   (C)   A person who receives a warning ticket or a citation may
either choose to abate the violation or file a petition for a drainage plan,
a stormwater drainage and sediment control ordinance waiver, or other means
provided by this subchapter to correct the violation, as prescribed below. A
person who elects to file such a petition shall indicate this intent in
writing to the issuing agency. A person shall have ten working days after
issuance of the warning ticket to file the petition, and additional monetary
fines as prescribed in § 53.73 shall be stayed upon the filing of such
petition, as long as the violation does not continue at the real estate. A
person who files the petition within said time period shall pursue the
petition in an expeditious fashion. If the petition is denied, withdrawn, or
dismissed for want of prosecution, and the civil stormwater drainage and
sediment control violation continues at the real estate, then a lawsuit will
be commenced by the designated enforcement entity in a court of competent
jurisdiction in Montgomery County, Indiana.



   (D)   If the violation is determined by the Stormwater
Superintendent or its designee to be a threat to public health or safety, the
Stormwater Superintendent or its designee may order the land use or activity
to cease and desist immediately, regardless of whether a warning ticket or
citation has been issued.



(Ord. 2-2010, passed 3-8-10)

the offense by indicating on the citation his or her intent to stand trial
and returning a copy of the citation to the Stormwater Superintendent. The
returned copy of the citation shall serve as notice of the person’s intent
to stand trial, and additional monetary fines prescribed in § 53.73 shall be
stayed upon receipt of the notice. On receipt of the notice of intention to
stand trial, a lawsuit will be commenced by the City Attorney in a court of
competent jurisdiction in Montgomery County, Indiana. The matter shall be
scheduled for trail, and a summons and order to appear shall be served upon
the defendant.



   (B)   If a person who receives a citation fails to pay the assessed
fine within 72 hours and fails to give notice of his or her intention to
either file a petition as prescribed in § 53.74, file an appeal as
prescribed in § 53.74, or stand trial as prescribed above, the City Attorney
may file a civil lawsuit as prescribed by applicable laws and ordinances, and
seek penalties as prescribes in this section.



   (C)   A person adjudged to have committed civil stormwater drainage
and sediment control violation is liable for the court costs and fees. No
costs shall be assessed against the enforcement agency in any such action.

   (C)   Person making. All applications shall be made by the property
owner. Other interested parties shall be listed for other than private access
permits. Other interested parties shall include all adjoining property
owners, lessees, purchase option holders and others willfully intent on
developing the property or adjoining property. All such persons listed shall
sign and consent to restrictions imposed as consideration of the request
being approved, or unless specifically waived by the Board, the application
shall be denied.



   (D)   Disclosure of intended use for or with adjacent parcels. All
applications for permits shall disclose the present and proposed use of the
parcel for which access is requested.  Any intended use of the access in
conjunction with any adjacent parcel, whether owned by the applicants or by
others or to be purchased or sold by the applicant or others, shall be
disclosed in the application. All adjacent parcels owned or controlled by the
applicants, whether intended to be used in conjunction with the requested
access or not shall be disclosed in the application.  In the case where
applicants own or control adjacent parcels, the Board may require applicants
to dedicate easements for driveways to facilitate the use of combined
entrances so that the number of access points along the highway may be
controlled to ensure the public a safe and convenient means of travel
consistent with the right of the adjoining landowner to have access as
provided by law.



   (E)   Designs. All applications shall be filed in accordance with
the standards, specifications and design requirements of the Board. The
permittee agrees to make the improvements in accordance with such standards,
specifications and design requirements of the Board.



   (F)   Commercial application; engineer’s attestation. All
applications for commercial purposes shall be signed by a registered
professional engineer, and/or registered land surveyor, attesting that the
applications as proposed, conform with all Board rules and standards, except
as he shall note in such attestation. All exceptions shall be accompanied by
an explanation as to why the exception should be granted.



   (G)   Other laws. Approval of a permit application shall be subject
to the permittee obtaining all necessary approvals involving land use from
the zoning board and/or Plan Commission having jurisdiction or authority and
complying with all applicable laws.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)

(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.06  STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS.



   All construction and materials used within the public right-of-way must
conform to the City Engineer “Standard Specifications” which shall be
kept on file at the office of the City Engineer.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)  Penalty, see § 70.99



§ 75.07  BONDS REQUIRED.



   The Board may require a performance bond to be filed along with each
application for a commercial driveway with an amount to equal the estimated
cost of that part of the project on the public right-of-way. The Board may
also require adequate bond to be filed in any non-commercial application.
Such bonds are required to insure compliance with all terms of the permit and
shall in the case of non-compliance, provide in addition to any damages
suffered thereby, all witness and court costs in collecting the same,
together with any attorney’s fee professional engineers; fees or land
surveyors’ fees reasonably due, and shall be released only when the work
described on the permit has been completed to the satisfaction of the Board.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.08  LOCATION OF CROSSOVERS.



   Permits for private or commercial crossovers will not be approved
unless the distance to the nearest existing crossover is in excess of 400
feet, unless the applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the Board that
the location of the crossover will not be detrimental to the safety of the
traveling public.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.09  DRIVEWAY STANDARDS.



   The most common examples of driveways and approaches are available from
the City Engineer, entitled “Driveway Standards.”  These standards will
apply in majority of cases because many conditions can be derived from each
figure. However, there will be exceptional situations and borderline cases
where the standards and guides do not apply. In such instances, alternate
standards will be used. The next lowest functional type will serve as the
alternate dimensions for each functional type (i.e., the alternate dimensions
for arterials are the dimension for collectors).  The use of alternate
dimensions will be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and such
approval should precede the filing of permit application. Additional
standards which will be required are as follows:



   (A)   Entrance and exit only driveways.



      (1)    This type of driveway is not highly recommended for a
divided roadway. However, the entrance and exit driveways do have a purpose
and when warranted use the following dimensions:



         (a)   Minimum width = 11 feet.



         (b)   Maximum width = 17 feet.



      (2)   In order to control entrance and exit drives, they must
be properly signed. This shall be the responsibility of the property owner.



   (B)   Number of driveways and spacing.  Driveway spacing is largely
dependent on land use and zoning, and as a result, it is difficult to develop
definite standards. Although from past experience and a literature review on
this subject, not more than two driveways are generally needed to serve a
tract of land.  Additional policies are as follows:



      (1)   Arterials. Frontage roads are encouraged but where this
is not feasible a minimum spacing of 150 feet is required between adjacent
property owners. Also, as a general rule, if the frontage is 100 feet or
less, only one driveway will be permitted.



      (2)   Collectors. A minimum spacing of 100 feet is required
and generally only one driveway per 100 feet of frontage will be allowed.



      (3)   Local. No minimum spacing is required; however, only one
driveway per lot will be allowed.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.10  VISIBILITY; TRAFFIC DEVICES; LOCATION OF PROPERTY LINE.



   (A)   All entrances and approaches shall be located so as to provide
adequate sight distance in both directions along the alley, thoroughfare or
highway for safe access to same without interfering with traffic.



   (B)   No entrance or approach shall be located or constructed so as
to interfere with or prevent the proper location of necessary highway signs
or other traffic-control devices.



   (C)   No approach radii shall be so constructed that any part of the
same extends in front of property belonging to persons other than the
permittee unless both property owners sign a joint application for the permit.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.11  DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS.



   All improvements authorized by the permit shall not interfere with
drainage of the street or highway, nor cause an additional area to drain onto
the right-of-way. However, part of the improvements within the public
right-of-way may drain toward the street or highway, subject to the approval
of the Board.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.12  WORK TO PROCEED SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS.



   Upon receipt of such permit the permit tee is authorized to proceed
with the work covered by it, subject to the conditions imposed by the Board
and these rules. If the application is approved with conditions, all of the
signatories to the original application shall indicate their consent to the
conditions in writing.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.13  FINAL APPROVAL OF THE PERMIT.



   A final approval of the permit shall be issued upon completion of
construction as covered by the permit to construct in accordance with the
plans and specifications filed in the application as amended by the Board;
together with any special conditions set forth by the permit; together with
an acceptance inspection by the City Engineer.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.14  LIMITATION OF ACCESS.



   The permittee shall at the time of receipt of a permit to construct
sign a copy of a “Limitation of Access” instrument, if so required by the
Board, which shall be obtained and left with the Permit Clerk of the City
Engineer’s Office, for recording in the deed record, together with a check
payable to the County Recorder covering the cost of recording the instrument.
The Permit Clerk shall immediately cause the limitation of access instrument
to be recorded and send acknowledgment thereof to the permittees.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.15  NOTIFICATION OF CITY ENGINEER.



   Before beginning work under any permit to construct, the permittee
shall notify, in writing, five days prior to start of work, the City Engineer
of the date he will begin such work.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.16  DISPLAY OF PERMIT REQUIRED.



   The applicant’s permit complete with drawings and special provisions
shall be on the job site at all times so that it can be shown, if requested.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.17  IMPROVEMENTS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN CERTAIN TIME PERIOD.



   All improvements authorized by a permit must be completed within one
year after the permit is issued; otherwise, the permit will be cancelled
unless an extension is requested, in writing, by the applicant, and the
request is approved by the Board. However, all construction authorized by the
permit on the right-of-way must be completed within 30 days after starting
the construction, unless otherwise expressly approved as a special condition.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.18  LIABILITY OF PERMITTEE.



   The permittee shall assume all responsibility (during the time from the
beginning of the work covered by any permit until final approval of the work)
and shall furthermore be obligated to save harmless the city from any and all
injury, loss or damage occasioned to or by persons or property resulting
directly or indirectly from such work; the Board, in its discretion, require
the permittee to provide liability and indemnity insurance for the use and
benefit of the city.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.19  CONSTRUCTION NOT TO INTERFERE WITH STRUCTURE IN RIGHT-OF-WAY;
ENCROACHMENT OF SIGNS.



   (A)   The construction of all improvements authorized by the permit
shall not interfere with any existing structure on any city street, alley or
thoroughfare without specific permission in writing from the Board or other
owner thereof. Any structure or traffic-control device affected by the
proposed construction shall be relocated at the applicant’s expense as
directed.



   (B)   The permittee shall not erect or maintain any advertising sign
on or over the right-of-way or any portion thereof in violation of any law.



(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)



§ 75.20  EXISTING ACCESS.



   Any person, who by law, has an existing legal right of access to a
street, alley or thoroughfare shall, if he desires to improve, relocate,
alter or remodel the same or if he has applied for and been issued final
approval of a permit under these rules, if he desires to make any change in
the character of the use of such right of access, shall as a condition of the
issuance of any permit and in consideration of the same, agree that such
rights of access, then existing or granted thereafter with respect to such
real estate shall be subject to these rules as the same may from time to time
be amended by the Board.

involved in a violation under I.C. 15-20-1-4 or I.C. 35-46-3.



   (B)   Actions to prevent harm to individuals or other animals. If
any animal is found at large and cannot be safely captured, a law enforcement
officer may seek assistance from an animal control agent, or take other
action deemed appropriate, including tranquilizing or killing such animal, to
prevent serious bodily injury to individuals, or severe injury to domestic
pets or domestic livestock.

      (1)   Any animals which are impounded pursuant to this chapter
shall be scanned or examined by the animal control facility for a microchip,
collar tag or other identification containing the owner’s name, address
and/or phone number, unless doing so presents an unreasonable risk of serious
bodily injury to an animal control agent.



      (2)   If an impounded animal’s owner can be identified, the
animal control facility shall notify the owner by the end of the next
business day that the animal has been impounded, and that unless the animal
is claimed by the owner within five days from the date of impoundment, the
animal may be placed for adoption or humanely euthanized. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of a second or subsequent impoundment, the impounded
animal may be placed for adoption or humanely euthanized if not claimed
within three days after the owner is notified.



      (3)   Stray animals without any means of identification of
their owners shall be held at the animal control facility a minimum of three
days in order to permit an owner adequate time to reclaim them. A Stray
animal which is unclaimed after having been impounded for three days may be
placed for adoption or humanely euthanized, except that the stray shall be
euthanized if it is a dangerous animal.



   (D)   Release from impoundment.

animal shall be responsible for all costs of impoundment, and must pay such
costs in full prior to the animal’s release from impoundment;



         (b)   Microchip implantation. Prior to the return to its

bear a microchip, collar tag or other means of identification, the animal
control agency shall cause a microchip with a registered identification
number to be implanted in the dog or cat at the owner’s expense. The animal
control agency shall be entitled to retain the dog or cat until the microchip
implantation fee is paid;



         (c)   Payment of county option dog tax. No dog impounded
pursuant to this chapter shall be released to its owner until the owner

respect to such dog. Any dog so impounded shall be considered unclaimed until
such tax is paid;



         (d)   No dog or cat impounded pursuant to this chapter
shall be released to its owner until the owner either presents proof that the
animal is spayed or neutered, or otherwise altered to prevent it from
procreating, or makes representation that the animal shall be spayed/neutered
within a time period specified by the animal control officer, and provides
proof thereafter;



         (e)   Proof of rabies vaccination. No dog, cat, or
ferret three months of age or older impounded pursuant to this chapter shall
be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of current rabies
vaccination; and



         (f)   Payment of fines. No animal impounded pursuant to
this chapter shall be released to its owner until the owner pays all fines
and costs imposed by this chapter.



      (2)   The return of a dangerous animal to its owner is
governed by § 91.12 of this chapter.



   (E)   Treatment or euthanizing of sick or injured animals. The
animal control facility shall have authority to take whatever action is
reasonably necessary, including humane euthanization, to deal with a sick or
injured animal, to prevent unnecessary suffering of the animal, or to prevent
the spread of communicable diseases. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the
animal control facility’s ability to take whatever action is reasonably
necessary to provide veterinary care by a veterinarian for a sick or injured
animal.

prosecution of that violation, including but not limited to impoundment and
boarding expenses, veterinary and other animal-care expenses, clean-up costs,

Indiana certified Fire Inspector. When the inspection occurs, the Inspector
will evaluate the premises for violations of the rules of FPBSC, this chapter
and other documents as adopted by the FPBSC. At completing the inspection,
the inspector will review the results with the occupant and leave a copy of
the Inspection Report with the occupant. At the end of the correction period,
a re-inspection may occur in approximately 30-45 days to determine if the
violations have been corrected. If the previously cited violations are
corrected, no other action will be needed. If violations are found to still
exist after this first re-inspection, then a copy of the inspection form will
be left with the occupant and the results reviewed with the occupant, the
occupant will then forward to the owner. A second re-inspection will occur in
approximately 15 days and a fee as per this chapter, will be assessed. If the
previous cited violations are corrected at this re-inspection, then no
further action will be required If previously cited violations are found, a
fee will be assessed and a third re-inspection will occur in approximately
five days. If those violations are not corrected, a fee will be assessed for
each re-inspection and those re-inspections will occur every five days until
the violations are corrected. If an Inspector completes an inspection and
finds an immediate fire or life safety hazard, the violation will be
corrected immediately. If the violation cannot be corrected immediately, a
Fire/Life Safety Order will be issued and the violation must be corrected by
the date on the Order. Failure to correct the violation by the date on the
Order will cause a fee and may cause further legal action to be taken against
the violator. The fees/fines of this chapter are besides those fines/fees
that may be levied by the state or city.



   (D)   Limits. The inspection or permitting of any building, system
or plan by the Fire Department, under the requirements of this chapter and
the rules of the FPBSC, will not be construed as a warranty of the physical
condition of such building, system or plan or the adequacy thereof, nor as an
approval thereof. Neither the city, Fire Department nor any of its agents,
will be liable in tort for damages for any defect or hazardous or illegal
condition or inadequacy in such building, system or plan, nor for any failure
of any component of such, which may occur subsequent to such inspection or

citizens an equal opportunity for and in education, employment, business,
access to public conveniences and accommodations and acquisition through
purchase of rental or real property, including but not limited to housing.
Equal education and employment opportunities and equal access to and use of
public accommodations and equal opportunities for acquisition of real
property are hereby declared to be civil rights.



   (B)   The practice of denying these rights to a person by reason of
race, religion, color, sex, age, handicap, national origin or ancestry of
such person is contrary to the principle of equal opportunity stated in this
section as public policy and, thus, shall be considered a discriminatory
practice.



   (C)   The promotion of equal opportunity without regard to race,
religion, color, sex, age, handicap, national origin or ancestry through
reasonable methods, is the purpose of this chapter. It is also its purpose to

real estate brokers, lending institutions and insurance companies from
unfounded charges of discrimination.

§ 95.04  SOUND LEVEL MEASUREMENT CRITERIA.



   Any sound level measurement made pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall be measured with a sound level meter using the “A”
weighting and shall be taken at the property line of the property into which
a noise is being projected unless otherwise specified; but in case a public
right-of-way such as an alley or street separates two properties, from the
center line thereof and readings shall be taken at the height of five feet.
But when the source of noise is directional the measurement may be made at
any height or location within the property into which noise is being
projected.

      (1)   Evidence of the general reputation of the property
alleged to constitute a drug nuisance is admissible to corroborate testimony
based on personal knowledge or observation, or to corroborate evidence seized
during the execution of a search and seizure warrant, but is not per se
sufficient to establish the existence of a drug nuisance under this section;
and



      (2)   Evidence that the drug nuisance had been discontinued at
the time of the filing of the complaint or at the time of the hearing does
not bar the imposition of appropriate relief by the court under this section.

sole discretion, may approve or disapprove any such request, without any
requirement to state the reasons therefor.



      (2)   If a waiver is granted, then granular backfill meeting
current INDOT Specifications for B Borrow, with an alternate compacted
aggregate approved by the Street Commissioner may be used when placed in
six-inch lifts and compacted to 95% of the maximum dry density, as determined
by accepted AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials) standards and procedures, and confirmed by test results from an
INDOT-certified laboratory, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Street

then the citizen or business shall construct the wheelchair ramp according to
the specifications prescribed by the City Engineer.



      (2)   Any person, firms or organizations who deem themselves

empowered to make the determination of existence of a condition of trees,
shrubs, vines or other plants constituting an emergency or health or safety
hazard in or abutting any parkway, alley or other city right-of-way. Upon
such determination, the Board may require the owner of the property on which
the condition exists or which abuts such parkway, alley or public
right-of-way, to remove the existing hazard by first causing notice to be
served upon such owner of the premises, requiring the property owner to
remedy the hazardous condition within a period of ten days from the receipt
of the notice. If the owner of the premises fails to remedy the hazard, as
determined by the Board, the Board may undertake to remedy said hazardous
condition, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the property owner,
and upon failure to pay the same, shall become a lien against the property of
the owner, as provided by Section 234 of the Acts of the Indiana General
Assembly of 1905, entitled “An Act Concerning Municipal Corporations.”

   99.03   Collection of cost of abatement and lien



§ 99.01  UNLAWFUL GROWTH.



   (A)   Violation. It is unlawful for the owner of any real estate in
the city to allow it to become overgrown with weeds, grass, or other rank
vegetation beyond the height of six inches.



   (B)   Policy. Because growth of weeds, grass, or other rank
vegetation beyond the height of six inches leads to increased presence of
insects and vermin, conceals dangerous conditions of the land, adversely
affects the property and adjacent properties, and otherwise adversely affects
the public health, safety and welfare, it is the policy of the city to
prohibit such conditions and to take all necessary action to remove such
conditions.



   (C)   Weeds and rank vegetation. For purposes of this chapter, WEEDS
AND RANK VEGETATION shall include all weeds, grasses and growing plants which
exceed a height of six inches, except agricultural crops, hay and pasture,
garden plants, ornamental grasses and plants used for landscape purposes,
wild flowers, and wetland and/or vegetation drainage.



   (D)   Nuisance. Weeds and rank vegetation which have grown to six
inches or more constitute a nuisance. The city is authorized to abate such
nuisances as provided for in this chapter or in Chapter 96 of this Code.



(Ord. 17-2014, passed 6-23-14)



§ 99.02  REMOVAL.



   (A)   Administration. The Street and Sanitation Department through
the Code Enforcement Officer shall be responsible for the administration of
this chapter.



   (B)   Notice to correct.



      (1)   If the city finds a violation of  § 99.01, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall mail to the property owner, at the address provided
to the County Auditor for tax statements, a notice to correct the violation.
If more than one property owner appears on the records of the County Auditor,
notice is sufficient if only one property owner is provided notice.



      (2)   This notice shall advise the owner of the violation,
describe the action to be taken by the owner to correct the violation, advise
the owner that he or she has ten days to correct the violation, advise the
owner of the city's remedies if the owner fails to correct, advise the owner
of his or her right to appeal the determination of violation, and notify the
owner of any other information which, at the city's discretion, will further
comply with the city's ordinances.



   (C)   Appeal of notice to correct. If the owner contests the
determination by the city that a violation exists, the owner may appeal this
determination by filing with the Board of Public Works and Safety a written
notice of appeal within seven days of the owner's receipt of the notice to
correct. The owner shall be deemed to have received the notice to correct on
the return of receipt if notified by certified mail or two days after the
notice was mailed by regular first class mail by the city, whichever is later.



   (D)   Procedure for appeal of notice to correct.  The Board of
Public Works and Safety shall conduct an evidentiary hearing of the city's
determination within 30 days after the notice of appeal is filed. At this
hearing, the city shall have the burden of proving the violation. The
violation must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The owner and
the city may be represented by attorneys, and shall have the right to call
witnesses and to confront them, and to present exhibits and other evidence
for the Board's consideration. The Board shall issue written findings of fact
and conclusions not more than ten days after the hearing and then mail the
same to the parties. If the Board determines that a violation existed, the
Board may exercise its remedies as provided herein. If the Board determines
that no violation existed, the notice to correct shall be deemed void and
have no force and effect.



   (E)   Remedies. In the event that the owner fails to correct the
violation as provided for in the notice, the city shall have all of the
following remedies.



      (1)   Fine. The city may fine the owner the sum of $100 for
each day the violation remains unabated. The first day the fine can be
assessed is the first day after the expiration of the ten-day cure period
which begins on receipt by the owner of the notice to correct. The city is
not required to provide to the owner any further notice or document as a
precondition to assessing the fine. The fine will continue to accrue until
the violation is corrected as provided for in the notice. The city shall
notify the owner of the fine due, and the owner shall have 30 days from
receipt of the notice to pay the fine to the Clerk-Treasurer. If the owner
fails to pay' the fine within 30 days, the city may file a complaint for the
collection of the fine which accrues due to the violation.



      (2)   City abatement. If the owner fails to timely abate each
violation set forth in the notice to correct, the owner shall be deemed to
have granted permission to the city to enter the owner's property for the
limited purpose of cutting and/or removing such weeds, grass, or rank
vegetation located thereon. In such case, the Code Enforcement Officer, or
his designee, shall prepare a certified statement as to the actual
administrative and other costs incurred by the city in taking such action and
provide this certified statement to the Clerk-Treasurer who shall serve a
copy of the invoice on the owner. The owner shall, within 30 calendar days
from the date on which the owner is served with such invoice, pay in full the
amount stated thereon to the Clerk-Treasurer.



      (3)   Lien. If the city corrects the violation and incurs the
expense of such corrective work, the city shall be entitled to a lien on the
real property of the owner in an amount equal to the city's cost of
correction and expenses incurred in the prosecution of the enforcement action.



      (4)   Attorney's fees and litigation expenses. If the city
brings an enforcement action under this section, the owner shall be liable
for any and all reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and litigation
expenses incurred by the city in the enforcement action. The city shall
notify the owner of these costs in the notice of fine, and the owner shall
have 30 days from receipt of the notice to pay the sum to the
Clerk-Treasurer. If the owner fails to pay the costs, the city may file a
complaint for the collection of these fees, costs and expenses.



      (5)   Other remedies. The city shall also have any other
remedy provided for by Indiana law or city ordinance. The city may exercise
one or more remedies without waiving its other available remedies.



   (F)   Continuous abatement and notice. If an initial notice to
correct was provided by certified mail or regular first class mail to an
owner of property in violation of this chapter a continuous abatement notice
may be posted at the property at the time of abatement by the city and serves
as notice to the owner that each subsequent violation during the same year
for which the initial notice to correct violation was provided may be abated
by the city or its contractors.



(Ord. 17-2014, passed 6-23-14)



§ 99.03  COLLECTION OF COST OF ABATEMENT AND LIEN.



   (A)   Collection. If the city abates the violation, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the owner of the actual costs of abatement, and
the amount of the administrative fee. If the owner fails to pay the costs and
fee within 30 days, the Clerk-Treasurer shall certify the unpaid amount to
the Montgomery County Auditor, plus any additional administrative costs
incurred in the certification.



   (B)   Lien. The Montgomery County Auditor shall place the total
amount certified on the real estate tax duplicate for the property affected.
The Montgomery County Treasurer shall collect the amount certified as
delinquent taxes and disperse the funds collected to the city's general fund.



   (C)   Appeal of fine or costs. Within seven days of receiving from
the city a notice of fines and expenses due, the owner may file an appeal of

conformity with the regulations contained herein and in conformity with
building code standards adopted by the city if they have been enacted and are
in force.



   (A)   Administrative subdivisions.



      (1)   Types of administrative subdivisions. An administrative
subdivision is a subdivision of land that, unless specified otherwise, is
specifically exempted from the preliminary and final plat approval procedures
of this chapter. An administrative subdivision must be one of the following
types of divisions:



         (a)   A division of land for residential use into two
additional tracts from the parent tract of which all tracts are at least one
and one half acres in size with the parent tract maintaining a minimum of ten
acres, provided the parent tract is greater than 13 acres in size.



         (b)   A division of land into no more than four tracts
for an agricultural use.



         (c)   A division of land for the transfer of tract or
tracts to correct errors in an existing legal description, provided that no
additional building sites (accessory structure excluded) are created by the
division.



         (d)   A division of land pursuant to an allocation of
land in the settlement of a decedent’s estate or court decree for the
distribution of property.



         (e)   A division of land for the unwilling sale of land
as a result of legal condemnations as defined and allowed by state law.



         (f)   A division of land for federal, state, or local
government to acquire street right-of- way;



         (g)   A division of land for the transfer of a tract or
tracts between adjoining lots, provided that the division does not create a
buildable lot for a principal use structure;



         (h)   A division of land into cemetery plots for the
purpose of burial of corpses;



         (i)   A division of land for the purpose of
straightening property boundary lines, provided that the division does not
cause a change in the existing land use.



         (j)   A residential lot split of three lots or fewer,
which does not involve the construction of any new street or road, or the
imposition of any adverse effect upon the use of the remainder of the land or
adjacent property.



      (2)   In the event of reasonable uncertainty as to whether a
lot split or subdivision will have an adverse effect upon the use of the
remainder of the land or adjacent property or otherwise qualifies as an
administrative subdivision, a person seeking to subdivide property pursuant
to division (A) of this section shall request a review of the proposed
subdivision or lot split by the Plan Director, who shall have the discretion
to determine whether it has an adverse impact or otherwise qualifies as an
administrative subdivision. In the event that a recorded subdivision or lot
split does in fact have an adverse impact, failure to request review by the
Plan Director may result in subsequent invalidation of the subdivision or lot
split or denial of improvement location permits or certificates of occupancy
for having been subdivided in violation of this section.



   (B)   Major subdivisions (residential or non-residential). Major
subdivisions include any land, vacant or improved, which is divided or
proposed to be divided into four or more lots of record for the purpose of
offer, sale, lease, or development either on the installment plan or upon any
and all other plans, terms, and conditions, including re-subdivision. Major
subdivisions are subject to a two- step approval process: primary and
secondary review and approval. Recording of the plat is not authorized until
after secondary plat approval is granted. All subdivision of land for
non-residential use shall be subject to the major subdivision process. Where
upon completion of all development,  the exact measurements of the location
of: building footprints; roads; utility lines; easements; dedicated parks,
open spaces, and facilities; and the like erected during the development are
necessary for public record and shall therefore be recorded. The developer
shall submit a copy of the approved Construction Plans (as-built plans), as
amended, to the Planning Director with the exact measurements thereon shown.
The Planning Director, after being satisfied that the measurements are
substantially the same as indicated on the originally approved final plan(s),
shall approve, date and sign said Construction Plans for the project, which
the developer shall then record.



   (C)   Minor subdivisions (non-residential). Non-residential minor
subdivisions may be subject to a one-step approval process. If an applicant
is seeking approval for a subdivision of three lots or less that does not
involve the construction of any new street or road, or the imposition of any
adverse effect upon the use of the remainder of the land or adjacent property
as determined by the Commission, and the activity does not conflict with
either a provision or portion of the Comprehensive Plan, the Official Zoning
Map, the Zoning Ordinance, approval of the minor subdivision plat may be
given by the Area Plan Commission at a single meeting. The applicant shall
provide the Area Plan Commission a plat and any other such information as
deemed necessary by the staff. Recording of the plat is not authorized until
after plat approval is granted.

§ 152.005  CONDOMINIUMS.



   I.C. 32-25 states that condominiums are exempt from local subdivision
control ordinances, meaning that the platting of condominium units regulated
by I.C. 32-25: Condominiums, is exempt for the provisions of this chapter.
Conversely, a condominium is formed by the filing of the declaration with the
County Recorder. Among other things, the declaration will contain the
following: the description of the land, the building (including the number of
stories and units), the common areas, the limited common areas, the
percentage of the undivided interest in the common areas, restrictions and
the bylaws will be attached. While exempt from the platting requirements of
this chapter, all condominium projects shall comply with all other applicable
standards and regulations adopted by the city, this includes, but is not
limited to the Zoning Ordinance, Building Code, and the city’s construction
manual adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety. Therefore, prior to
obtaining a building permit for the construction of condominium property, the
builder(s) or developer(s) shall file a copy of the executed and recorded
declaration of the project as a condominium project with the Planning
Director consistent with § 153.056(F).



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.006  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.



   Following adoption of an ordinance by the City Council providing for a
planned unit development (PUD), the procedure for platting within the
districts shall be the same as that prescribed for subdivisions in this
chapter and in compliance with the procedures and regulations set forth in §
153.017, Planned Unit Development, of the Crawfordsville Zoning Ordinance, as
amended from time to time.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.007  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.



   Whenever there is a difference between standards or provisions
specified herein and those contained in other regulations, resolutions or
ordinances of the city, county or state, the most restrictive standards shall
govern and the governing body of the most restrictive standards shall be the
governing authority of said standards.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.008  JURISDICTIONAL AREA.

corporate boundaries.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.009  AUTHORITY.



   (A)   Plat approval authority.  This chapter, which was enacted
pursuant to Indiana home rule and planning legislation (I.C. 36-1-3-4 and
I.C. 36-7-4-700 et seq., as amended) authorizes the Plan Commission and the
city to review and approve or disapprove plats for subdivision throughout the
jurisdiction of the city. This authority extends to the development or
re-subdivision of undeveloped portions of previously recorded plats.



   (B)   Designation of the Administrator.  The Planning Director
and/or his or her designee is hereby designated as the Administrator for the
purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter.



   (C)   Plat Committee. The Commission hereby delegates to a Plat
Committee, as established in the Crawfordsville Zoning Ordinance, the
authority to grant secondary approval, unless by the written primary
approval, the Commission specifically reserves the right to make secondary
approval based on circumstances deemed necessary by the Commission.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.010  WAIVER.



   (A)   General.  Where the Commission finds that unnecessary
hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with
these regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve waivers to these
subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest served, provided that the waivers shall not have the effect
of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations, and further
provided the Commission shall not approve waivers unless it shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that
the following apply:



      (1)   The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to
the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other nearby property.



      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is
based are unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property.



      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape
or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship or practical difficulty to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is
carried out.



      (4)   The waiver will not in any manner contravene the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or official map as
interpreted by the Commission and the Planning Director.



   (B)   Conditions. In approving waivers, the Commission may require
conditions to, in its judgment; secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.



   (C)   Procedures. A petition for any waiver shall be submitted in
writing by the applicant at the time when either the primary or secondary
plat is filed for consideration by the Commission. The petition shall state
fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the
petitioner.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.010  PRE-ANNEXATION AGREEMENTS.



   The Board of Works is hereby authorized and delegated the authority to
enter into Pre- Annexation Agreements with applicants. Under circumstances
deemed appropriate by the Commission and/or the Board of Works, such

the Planning Director. Any deficiencies found in the design and workmanship
of public improvements shall be corrected by the developer prior to release
of the performance bond.



      (2)   At such time as the public improvements are acceptable
to the Administrator or his designee, the Administrator shall release the
performance bond in lieu of a three-year maintenance bond. The amount of the
maintenance bond shall be equal to or greater than 20% of the corresponding
performance bond. Maintenance bonds shall be in one of the forms as deemed
acceptable for performance bonds. Maintenance bonds shall also be required
after acceptance of completed improvements for which no performance bond was
posted.



   (E)   As-built plans required.  As a condition for release of a
performance bond, the developer shall have met the requirement to record
Construction Plans (as-built plans) as required by this chapter.



   (F)   Release of maintenance bond.  At least 60 days prior to the
expiration date of a maintenance bond, ft shall be the responsibility of the
developer to make a written request to the Administrator for final inspection
and full acceptance of responsibility of the public improvement. Upon receipt
of the request, the Administrator shall instruct the Building Department and
other appropriate representatives to inspect the improvements. Any
deficiencies found in the workmanship or materials shall be corrected by the
developer prior to release of the maintenance bond. At the time the
improvements are acceptable to the Planning Director, the Planning Director
shall release the maintenance bond and the city shall thereby assume full and
permanent responsibility for maintenance of the public improvement.



   (G)   Acceptance by the city. Construction and maintenance of a
public improvement shall be deemed as the full responsibility of the
developer until the public improvement is accepted by official action and
written notice by the Planning Director. Expiration of a maintenance bond
does not relieve a developer from the responsibility of having the public
improvements meet city standards and specifications prior to official
acceptance by the city. Such improvements shall be completed to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, and the applicant shall dedicate such
improvements to the city or county free and clear of all encumbrances.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.030  INSPECTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.



   If the participating jurisdiction finds upon inspection that any of the
public improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the approved
construction plans, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the
public improvements according to such plans. Where the cost of the public
improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding
company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the public
improvements according to specifications.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.031  RECORDING OF SUBDIVISION PLAT.



   (A)   Legal effect of subdivision.  The plat of the subdivision is
without legal effect unless and until approved and signed by the Plat
Committee as herein provided and filed with the Auditor and the  Recorder of
Montgomery County. Unless the plat is duly recorded within 90 days from the
date of the secondary plat approval, the Plat Committee approval of the plat
shall expire and shall be of no effect until subsequently reinstated by the
Plat Committee.



   (B)   Extension.  Recording of a secondary plat upon granting of
secondary approval may be extended by the Plan Commission until improvements
are completed and the plat is signed if it is the intention of the petitioner
to complete the improvements before the plat is signed rather than posting a
performance bond.



   (C)   Subdivision of land by reason of leasehold interest only. 
This provision requiring the recording of a subdivision plat upon the
granting of secondary approval may be waived by the Plan Commission in the
case of development of land coming within the definition of subdivisions
under this chapter solely by reason of the division of land by reason of
leasehold interests only. In such case, the subsequent transfer of ownership
of any portion or parcel thereof by other than leasehold interest, shall
require the same to be resubmitted to the Plat Committee for approval under
the terms of this chapter, including recording.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS



§ 152.040  CHARACTER OF THE LAND.



   (A)   Unsuitable land.  Any land which is unsuitable for
subdivision or development because of improper drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, adverse earth formation or topography, utility easements or other
features which might reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate
methods are formulated by the developer to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for those uses
permitted by the Crawfordsville Zoning Ordinance which do not involve any
such danger.



   (B)   Inclusion of a thoroughfare. Whenever a tract to be subdivided
embraces any part of a major street, boulevard or parkway, this part of the
proposed public way shall be platted by the applicant and the locations and
the widths indicated. Due consideration shall also be given by the applicant
and owners of adjoining property for the provisions of school sites, park
sites, right-of-way for public utility lines, sites for business centers,
industrial locations and other features as indicated on the Comprehensive
Plan.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.041  SUBDIVISION NAMES.



   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too
closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision or mobile
home park within the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission. The Commission
shall reserve final authority to designate the name of the subdivision at the
time of preliminary approval.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.042  POLITICAL AND JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES.



   To eliminate potential jurisdictional disputes, and to facilitate
effective coordination and control of development, the Commission shall be
guided by the following policy:



   (A)   Access via another government’s jurisdiction. Whenever
access to the subdivision is required to cross land within another local
government jurisdiction, the Commission shall request assurance from the
attorney for said jurisdiction that such access is legally established, and
from the designated engineer for said jurisdiction that the access road is
adequately improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is
sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road.



   (B)   Delineation of lot lines.  Lot lines shall be laid out so as
not to cross boundary lines between adjacent units of local government, each
of which has a separate, autonomous governing body.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.043  MATERIAL AND CONSTRUCTION CONTROL.



   To assure compliance with good engineering practices, the applicant
shall be required to follow the latest issue of the “Crawfordsville
Standards”, as amended from time to time, for material and construction
control, except when different specifications are explicitly prescribed in
these regulations or adopted and approved by rule by the Commission.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.044  BOUNDARY LINE MARKERS AND MONUMENTS.



   (A)   General. All markers/monuments will be properly set flush with
the ground and approved by a registered land surveyor prior to the time the
Commission grants secondary approval to the plat.



   (B)   External boundaries.



      (1)   The applicant shall place monuments at the intersection
of all lines forming angles in the boundary of the subdivision and at all
intersections of street right-of-way lines and at the beginning and end of
all curves along street right-of-way lines.



      (2)   Monuments shall be of an iron or steel solid bar at
least 30 inches in length and not less than 5/8 of an inch in diameter, or of
concrete with dimensions of four inches square or four inches in diameter at
least 30 inches in length and marked with a cross, brass plug, iron rod or
other durable material securely embedded so that the top of the dowel is
flush with the top of the monument. Monuments shall be set following grading
of each phase of the subdivision.



   (C)   Internal boundaries.



      (1)   The applicant shall place markers, unless otherwise
located by a monument, at all points where lot lines intersect street
right-of-way lines, at all angles in the lot property lines, and at all other
lot comers.



      (2)   Markers shall be galvanized steel or wrought iron pipe
or steel bars at least 5/8 of an inch in diameter and at least 24 inches in
length. They shall be set prior to the issuance of any building permit.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.045  BLOCK AND LOT REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Blocks.



      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient depth to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width
shall be permitted for perimeter lots, in blocks adjacent to major streets
and railroad right-of-ways and industrial/commercial areas.



      (2)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such
as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated
and in compliance with the Chapter 153 and amendments thereto.



   (B)   Lots.



      (1)   Lot arrangements shall be designed in such a way that
there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other
conditions, in securing building permits or Improvement Locations Permits to
build on all lots in compliance with Chapter 153 and other regulations; and
in providing safe driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved
street.



      (2)   Lot dimensions shall not be less than the minimum
requirements specified by Chapter 153 and amendments thereto, for the
district in which the lot is located.



      (3)   Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
street lines and radial to curved street lines. The Commission may consider
variations from this rule if such result in a street or lot plan which better
serves the purposes of this chapter.



      (4)   Building set-back lines for individual lots shall follow
the requirements of Chapter 153, and amendments thereto, for the district in
which the lot is located.



      (5)   Provisions shall be made for off-street parking in the
subdivision design following the requirements of Chapter 153, and amendments
thereto, for the district in which the lot is located.



      (6)   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be
discouraged except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets, or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. The use of frontage roads to allow residential
development to front on arterial streets is encouraged.



      (7)   All lots shall abut on a street which is accessible to
an established public street already in use.



      (8)   Lots shall be laid out so as to provide drainage away
from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm drainage pattern for the area.



      (9)   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in
any land, or left deposited on any lot or street at the time the buildings
are ready for occupancy.



      (10)   An applicant may be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous condition exists.
Fencing shall be constructed according to the provisions to the Chapter 153,
and amendments thereto.



      (11)   Except where alleys are provided for this purpose, each
lot shall have an easement for utilities along the front or side.



      (12)   When the terrain so requires, easements for sanitary
sewers along lot lines other than the front lot lines shall be provided.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 152.046  STREETS.



   (A)   General requirement.  In order to provide subdivision streets
of suitable location, width and construction; and to afford access to police,
fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation and road maintenance equipment; and
to coordinate subdivision street development with the existing street system
and the Comprehensive Plan, all subdivision streets in the secondary plat
submitted for approval shall be designed in accord with the standards set
forth in this section, as amended from time to time, as well as the city
specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety, as amended
from time to time. In the event that mere is a conflict between this chapter
and the Specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety, the
more restrictive standard shall apply.



   (B)   Arrangement standards.  The layout of subdivision streets
shall conform to the following:



      (1)   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage
their use by through traffic.



      (2)   Subdivision streets shall extend to the boundary lines
of the subdivision tract and be installed as stub-streets in order to provide
for their future extension into adjacent areas.



      (3)   Streets and access ways in business and industrial
developments shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
the location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading
and maneuvering areas, walkways, and parking areas so as to minimize conflict
of movement between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.



      (4)   All streets and alleys shall have a clear vertical
clearance from the roadway surface to any overhead obstruction of at least 15
feet.



   (C)   Intersection standards.  The following standards shall apply
to all subdivision street intersections:



      (1)    With the exception of roundabouts, the centerlines of
intersecting streets shall intersect as near as possible at right angles (90
degrees), in which case the intersecting angles of said streets shall be no
less than 75 degrees. All intersections are subject to approval of the Plan
Commission.



   Figure 1: Intersection Centerlines and Angles







 



      (2)   The simultaneous intersection of streets resulting in
traffic from more than four streets is prohibited.



      (3)   The property, or right-of-way lines, of comer lots at
street intersections shall be rounded at the comer with an arc, of at least
15 feet minimal radius, drawn tangent to each of the intersection property
lines.



      (4)   The minimum distance between the centerlines of parallel
or approximately parallel streets intersecting a cross-street from opposite
directions shall be 125 feet.



      (5)   The maximum slope approaching an intersection shall be
8%.

   (E)   Topography.



      (1)   Subdivision streets shall be arranged in proper relation
to the topography in a manner which results in usable lots, safe streets and
acceptable gradients; and in a manner which does not cause unnecessary
destruction of drainage courses, trees and other natural features of the land.



      (2)   Rectangular, “gridiron” streets shall be avoided,
and the use of curvilinear streets shall be encouraged where such use will
result in a more desirable layout and topographical relationship. Innovative,
varying geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where such provide a
sense of order and enhance esthetic interest.



      (3)   Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards specified
by these regulations shall be required whenever additional width is
necessary, due to topographical conditions, to provide for adequate and
stable earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of a three to one
(3:1) height to width ratio.



   (F)   Alleys. Alleys may be allowed in all commercial and industrial
districts. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential districts except
where justified by unusual conditions or consistent with the proposed
development pattern.



   (G)   Cul-de-sacs/dead end streets.  Cul-de-sacs shall not be
permitted in any district where such are in conflict with the Comprehensive
Plan. No permitted cul-de-sac shall provide principle frontage to more than
20 lots or be longer than 500 feet, including a turn-around, whichever is
less. Whenever a collector street exclusively serves an industrial or
commercial area, a cul-de-sac of up to 1,000 feet in length may be allowed.
This special provision shall be allowed only in areas where access is
difficult or which are otherwise unsuitable for normal subdividing. The
minimum radii for cul-de-sacs shall be as prescribed in the city
specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety, as amended
from time to time.



   (H)   Continuation of streets, alleys and easements.  Whenever a
dedicated or platted portion of a street, alley or easement exists adjacent
to a proposed subdivision, the continuation of the street, alley or easement
right-of-way at the prescribed width, shall be platted within said
subdivision unless the Commission deems such continuation unnecessary.



   (I)   Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths.  Subdivision
streets and alleys shall be designed in accordance with the city
specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety, as amended
from time to time.



   (J)   Construction standards.  All subdivision streets shall be
constructed according to the following standards:



      (1)   Subdivision streets shall be completed to the grades
specified on their respective plans, profiles and cross-sections as approved
by the Commission.



      (2)   The minimum specifications for subdivision street
construction and materials shall be as set forth in the applicable sections
of the “Crawfordsville Standards,” as amended from time to time, except
where the Commission has by rule adopted a different set of standards and
specifications, or as required in this chapter. Street surfaces shall be of a
character suitable for expected traffic and shall be in harmony with similar
improvements in the surrounding area.



   (K)   Railroads and limited access highways.  If a proposed
subdivision plat adjoins a railroad right- of-way and/or a limited access
highway, the following requirements shall apply:



      (1)   In all residential districts, a buffer strip of at least
25 feet in depth, in addition to the normal lot depth required for such
districts by the Zoning Code in Chapter 153 and amendments  thereto, shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
submitted preliminary plat as follows: “This strip is reserved for
screening. The placement of structures hereon, other than earth berms, walls,
fences and other landscape screening devices approved by the Commission is
prohibited.”



      (2)   In all districts, streets running parallel to a railroad
right-of-way shall be located at least 150 feet from said right-of-way upon
intersecting with a street which crosses the railroad at grade.



   (L)   Street names. Subdivision street names shall not duplicate any
existing street name within the county except in the case of a direct
extension. Street names that are spelled differently from, but sound the same
as, existing streets shall not be allowed. In no instance shall any street
name include the word north, south, east or west, unless it denotes a
geographic location. In event of a conflict, the Plan Commission shall have
final authority to name all streets upon granting preliminary or secondary
plat approval.



   (M)   Street dedications and reservations.



      (1)   All subdivision streets shall be dedicated to public
use. The Commission may consider allowing private streets in the event of
unusual physical conditions and if the applicant can provide evidence that a
private street is the only feasible solution. Such private streets may be
authorized provided that the standards applied in their construction comply
with this section and the city specifications adopted by the Board of Public
Works and Safety, and that adequate covenant provisions are made for direct
responsibility and control, by the property owners involved, for the
perpetual operation, liability and maintenance of said private streets at no
expense to the city.



      (2)   Subdivision street systems shall be laid out in a manner
which eliminates or avoids new perimeter half-streets. When an existing
half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street
shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the applicant improves and dedicates
the entire required right-of-way width within his own subdivision’s
boundaries.



      (3)   Whenever a proposed subdivision borders an existing
street, the Commission may require the reconstruction or widening of such
street as a condition of preliminary or secondary plat approval. Land
reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying the yard or
area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance in Chapter 153 or amendments
thereto.

§ 152.047  TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.



   (A)   Installation of street signs.  The applicant shall install
street name signs in accordance with the standards adopted by the Commission
and the Board of Public Works and Safety, and the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices of Indiana. One sign shall be installed at each intersection
indicating the name of each intersecting street. Other regulating signs are
the responsibility of the city or county.



   (B)   Installation of warning signs and other traffic control
devices.  The city shall be responsible for the installation of all warning
signs and other traffic control devices, except where warranted in 
industrial and commercial areas. The developer may be required to pay the
cost of the study to establish a need for said traffic signal as well as the
installation and interconnection of said traffic signal.



(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)

   (A)   Location.  Sidewalks shall be provided by the applicant on
each side of all streets within the subdivision.



   (B)   Provision of easements.  The Commission may require
perpetual, unobstructed easements, at least ten feet in width, in order to
facilitate pedestrian access from the street to schools, parks, playgrounds
or other nearby streets. Such easements shall be indicated on both the
preliminary and secondary plats.



   (C)   Grading. Grading of the entire right-of-way shall be provided
for the location of sidewalks one foot from front lot lines, and a proper
grade shall be provided by the applicant according to the standards shown on
the plans, profiles and cross-sections approved by the Commission.



   (D)   Dimensions.  Subdivision sidewalks shall be in conformance
with the following minimum requirements:

§ 152.049  CURBS AND GUTTERS.



   (A)   Installation requirement.  The applicant shall be required to
install curbs and gutters on each side of any subdivision street surface,
except as provided in division (B) below, constructed of concrete. Curbs may
be vertical curb, integral curb and gutter or separate curb and gutter. Roll
curbs are expressly prohibited within the jurisdiction of the Crawfordsville
Plan Commission.



   (B)   Exceptions.  Curbs and gutters may be omitted in any
subdivision if all of the following conditions are met:



      (1)   When final topography, street longitudinal profiles, and
drainage system designs are acceptable.



      (2)   When adequate provisions are made in the protective
covenants running with the land to permit access to, and freedom from,
obstruction of the drainage system.



      (3)   When the street is properly acceptable to the Commission
as a local street.



      (4)   When every lot fronting on a street has a minimum lot
area of 40,000 square feet and a minimum width of 150 feet.

§ 152.051  WATER FACILITIES.



   (A)   General requirements. The applicant shall extend or create a
water supply system capable of providing water for domestic use and fire
protection. The applicant shall, where a public water main is accessible,
install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to State
and Local requirements and approvals, the requirements of this chapter and
amendments hereto, and such requirements as the Commission may adopt by rule.



   (B)   Fire hydrants.  For all subdivisions served by quasi-public
water systems, fire hydrants for residential use shall be located not more
than 750 feet apart and within 500 feet of any structure, and shall be of a
design approved by the Commission and the Fire Department. For higher risk
areas, different spacing of the hydrants may be required by the Fire
Department.



   (C)   Water systems.  The applicant shall install a subdivision
water system by one of the following methods:



      (1)   Quasi-public utility.  A complete water main system
connected into the water main system of a utility company authorized to
operate within the area where the subdivision is located and which is subject
to the control of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. The applicant
shall submit plans for the complete installation of the subdivision water
main system showing size, location, depth, material and all connections for
approval of the appropriate Board of Health and/or the Indiana Department of

PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION



§ 153.001  TITLE.



   The official title of this chapter is “Zoning Ordinance of
Crawfordsville, Indiana and Contiguous Unincorporated Areas.”



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.002  AUTHORITY.



   This chapter is enacted by the City Council pursuant to its authority
vested in I.C. 36-7-4-600 et seq., and other applicable state and federal
statutes, as amended from time-to-time.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.003  INTENT AND PURPOSE.



   This chapter is based in large part on the adopted the city
Comprehensive Plan, as amended from time-to-time, and similar plans guiding
the future development the city. This chapter is intended to implement the
Comprehensive Plan by regulating the use of land, buildings and structures
for the purpose of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of the city.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.004  INTERPRETATION.



   This chapter applies to all land uses and the construction, erection
and/or alteration of structures within the city as follows:



   (A)   Minimum requirements.  In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the city.



   (B)   Continuation of an existing land use.  An existing, legally
established land use is lawful and not in violation of the city code,
provided that it is operated and maintained in compliance with all other
applicable provisions of this chapter.



   (C)   Effect of Zoning Ordinance changes on projects in progress. 
This chapter, as amended from time-to-time, may impose different standards on
new land uses, structures, or improvements than those that formerly applied
to existing development. The following provisions determine how the
requirements of this chapter apply to projects in progress at the time the
requirements of this chapter are changed.



      (1)   Projects with pending applications.  Projects in which
the application has not yet been determined to be complete by the Planning
Director before the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto
will be processed according to the requirements in effect when the
application was deemed to be complete.



      (2)   Approved projects not yet under construction. 
Consistent with I.C. 36-7-4-1109, any approved development project for which
construction has not begun as of the effective date of this chapter, or any
amendment thereto, may still be constructed as approved, so long as the first
improvement location permit is obtained within three  years and where
construction is substantially complete within seven years of the submittal of
the complete application. Should either of these requirements not be met, the
project will be subject to the most recent, or current provisions of this
chapter, rather than the regulations in place at the time the application was
filed.



      (3)   Approved projects not requiring construction. Any
approved development project not requiring construction, that has not been
established as of the effective date of this chapter, or any amendments
thereto, may still be established in compliance with its approved permit, so
long as establishment occurs before the expiration of said permit.



      (4)   Projects under construction. Approved improvements
and/or structure(s) under construction at the time this chapter or any
amendments thereto, shall be continued under the chapter in which they were
reviewed and approved. The improvements and/or structure(s) shall be
substantially complete within seven years of the issue date of submissions of
the complete application. If the improvements or structure(s) are not
substantially complete within seven years from submission of the complete
application, the city shall require said improvements and/or structure(s) to
conform to the standards of the ordinance(s) in effect at that time.



   (D)   Conformity of lots created prior to adoption of this
chapter.  Any lot legally created prior to the effective date of this
chapter which does not meet the minimum lot size required by this chapter
shall be considered legal non-conforming.



   (E)   Other requirements may still apply.  Nothing in this chapter
shall eliminate the need for obtaining any other approval or entitlement
required by other provisions of the city code or the requirements of any city
department, or any local, state or federal agency.



   (F)   Conflict with public and private provisions.



      (1)   Public provisions.  These regulations are not intended
to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or
regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of these
regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
provision of these  regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation,
or other provision of law, those provisions which are more restrictive or
impose higher standards shall govern.



      (2)   Private provisions.  These regulations are not intended
to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or
restriction, except in instances where the provisions of these regulations
are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than any
easement, covenant, or other private agreement or restriction, in which case
the requirements of these regulations shall govern. Where the provisions of
the easement, covenant, or private agreement or restriction impose duties and
obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of
these regulations or the determinations of the Commission in enforcing these
regulations, and the private provisions are not inconsistent with these
regulations or determinations hereunder, then the private provisions shall be
operative an supplemental to these regulations, or the determinations made
there under. In addition, private provisions shall only be enforced privately.

      A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A
ZONES floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The
definitions for these sub- zones are as follows:



         (a)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply. Zone AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to
inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event determined by detailed
methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in
place of Zones A1-A30.)



         (b)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual
chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



         (c)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual
chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.

         (e)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon
completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These
are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the
construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to
consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used
when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress
toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory
flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.022  ZONING DISTRICTS.



   The city and contiguous unincorporated area are divided into the
districts stated in this chapter as shown by the district boundaries on the
Zone Map. There are created for zoning purposes within the territory under
the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission, classes of districts with the
following names and designations:



   (A)   Conservation District.  The conservation district (“C-1")
is intended to be limited to agricultural, recreational and certain other
open land uses. The purpose of this district is to prevent intensive
development of land that is unsuitable for development because of topography,
soil conditions, periodic flooding, or other natural features. Residential
and related uses may be permitted by special exception. Refer to the Appendix
A: Official Schedule of Uses.



   (B)   Agricultural-Residential District. The
agricultural-residential district (“A-R”) is intended for areas that
cannot feasibly be served with public water and sewer facilities. This
district will preserve and protect agricultural land from undesirable urban
growth while permitting residential development on large lots, which provide
adequate space for private water and sewerage facilities.



   (C)   Residential Districts. The residential districts (“R-l”,
“R-2", and “R-3") are intended to be limited to dwellings and public or
semi-public uses which are normally associated with residential
neighborhoods. The only uses permitted in the residential districts are those
which would not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood
(refer to Appendix A: the Official Schedule of Uses). While the number of
families, the lot and yard requirements, and the setbacks may vary between
each residential district so that the city may provide for the housing needs
and desires of all its citizens, the overarching purpose of these districts
is to create an attractive, stable, and orderly residential neighborhood
environment.



   (D)   Business Districts.  The business districts (“B-1, “B-2",
and “B-3") are intended to be limited to business, public and certain
residential uses and to provide for conveniently located unified shopping
destinations. Through the establishment of relatively compact districts for
all business related uses, the city is better able to provide for more
efficient and effective traffic movement, parking facilities, and emergency
services. Industrial uses are often excluded in order to reduce the hazards
caused by the extensive truck and rail movements which are typically
associated with such industrial uses. The “B-1 district is intended to be
limited to the downtown area.



   (E)   Industrial Districts.  The industrial districts (“I-1" and
“I-2") are intended to provide suitable space for the expansion of existing
industrial uses as well as for future industrial development. The desirable
location for these districts are parcels near railroads or highways. These
parcels are typically well suited to the transportation needs of industrial
uses. Performance and developing standards and regulations are set forth in
this chapter in order to insure that industrial development is compatible
with adjacent uses.



   (F)   Planned Unit Development District.  The intent of a planned
unit development (PUD) is to encourage innovative residential communities and
mixed-use developments within the City of Crawfordsville that will preserve
the natural amenities of the site and provide for the general welfare of the
jurisdiction. Developers of planned unit developments will be offered
flexibility in design and development. However, a PUD shall not compromise
the purpose of this chapter nor shall it be a far departure from the purpose
and intent of the original district.



   (G)   Stream Corridor District.  The purpose of the stream corridor
district (“SC”) is to preserve and protect the existing natural and
scenic qualities of lands adjacent to streams of unique historical, scenic
and recreational value. By limiting the type of uses permitted, either by
right or be special exception, within the SC District, the city is better
able to: preserve the stream and the lands adjacent to it in an undisturbed
natural state so as to add in the aesthetic appeal and water quality of the
stream corridor; protect wildlife and natural vegetation; and, prevent
erosion. The Stream Corridor District shall extend 150 feet horizontally in
each direction measured from the center thread and/or secondary thread of the
stream. Special exceptions may require flood plain permits and/or
recommendations from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. These
permits and/or recommendations shall be obtained prior to any action by the
Board of Zoning Appeals. The BZA may impose greater restrictions. In
addition, there shall be no clear cutting of timber or complete removal of
vegetation within the district. Timber may be cut using good forestry
practices and vegetation may be trimmed.

EXPLANATION OF USE CLASSIFICATIONS



§ 153.030  OFFICIAL SCHEDULE OF USES.



   Certain principal and accessory uses are permitted, either by right or
by special exception, in each zoning district. The city’s Official Schedule
of Uses shall determine whether or not a specific use is permitted or
prohibited in each of the established zoning districts. Uses not specifically
listed or defined to be included in this division shall be prohibited.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



Cross reference:



   Schedule of Uses, see Ch. 153, Appendix A



§ 153.031  PERMITTED USES.



   Permitted uses are allowed, by right, in a particular zoning district
or districts and shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to that
zoning district. Permitted uses do not require consideration or approval by
the Board of Zoning Appeals.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.032  SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES.



   Certain uses may be appropriate in any number of districts; however,
some uses may require an added degree of scrutiny in the form of development
plan review to ensure that the proposed activities, traffic generation, on-
and off-street parking, and other elements of the project do not negatively
affect adjacent properties. Special exception uses are only permissible with
the issuance of a special exception use permit. The special exception uses
for each district are listed in the official schedule of uses. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall take into consideration all of the applicable provisions
of this chapter, and any other applicable ordinance or regulations when
reviewing and deciding on any special exception use permit.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)

§ 153.035  NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS AND STRUCTURES. 



   Within the districts established by this chapter, including amendments
thereto, there may exist lots, uses, or structures which were lawful before
the effective date of this chapter, but which would be prohibited, regulated
or restricted under the terms of this chapter. It is the intent of this
section to allow said nonconforming lots, uses, or structures to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Nothing in this
section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, or restoring to a safe
condition, any building or part thereof which has been declared to be unsafe
by any official charged with protecting the public safety. The existence of
nonconforming lots, uses and structures is not to be used as grounds for
adding similar lots, uses or structures which would otherwise be prohibited.
Nonconforming situations shall be governed as follows:



   (A)   Agricultural uses.  Consistent with I.C. 36-7-4-616, an
agricultural use of land that constitutes an agricultural nonconforming use
may be changed to another agricultural use of land without losing
agricultural nonconforming use status. In addition, an agricultural
nonconforming use shall not be restricted or required to obtain a variance or
special exception so long as an agricultural nonconforming use has been
maintained for three years in a five year period.



   (B)   Single nonconforming lots of record.  In any district,
construction on a single nonconforming lot of record in existence prior to
the effective date of this chapter, as amended from time-to-time, and
excluding any other limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter,
are subject to the following:



      (1)    Any nonconforming lot shall be in a separate ownership
and not contiguous with other lots in the same ownership; and



      (2)   All setback, height and other applicable provisions of
the zoning district shall be satisfied unless appropriate variances are
obtained.



   (C)   Nonconforming lots of record in combination.  If two  or
more lots, or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous
frontage in single ownership, are of record prior to the effective date of
this chapter, as amended from time-to-time, and if all or part of the lot(s)
which is void of any structure(s) do not meet the requirements established
for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for the purposes of administering and enforcing this
chapter. No portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with the lot, width, and area requirements established
by this chapter. Nor shall any division of a parcel be made which creates a
lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.



   (D)   Nonconforming uses.  Where, at the time of adoption of this
chapter, lawful use(s) of land exist which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this chapter, as amended from time-to- time, the
use(s) may be continued so long as they otherwise remain lawful. Such uses
shall also be subject to the following provisions:



      (1)   A nonconforming use may be continued but shall not be
extended, expanded, or changed unless to a conforming use, except as
permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.



      (2)   A nonconforming use shall not be moved, in whole or in
part, to any portion of the lot or parcel.



      (3)   In the event that any nonconforming use which is
conducted within a structure ceases, for whatever reason, for a period of one
year, said nonconforming use shall not be resumed, unless approved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.



      (4)   No structure shall be erected, constructed, or altered
in connection with a legally nonconforming use of land.



   (E)   Nonconforming structures.  Where a structure that could no
longer be built under the provisions of this chapter exists, the structure
may continue to exist so long as it remains otherwise lawful. Said structure
shall also be subject to the following provisions:



      (1)   A nonconforming structure may continue to exist but
shall not be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
Conversely, a nonconforming structure may be altered so as to decrease its
nonconformity.



      (2)   Any nonconforming structure damaged by fire, flood,
explosion, wind, or other catastrophe may be reconstructed and used as before
if:



         (a)   Such reconstruction is performed within 12 months
of such catastrophe; and



         (b)   If the restored structure has no greater coverage
and no greater cubic content than before such catastrophe.



      (3)   (a)   In the event that any nonconforming use
conducted in a structure or at a location ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of one year; or



         (b)   In the event that such nonconforming use is
intentionally abandoned for any period, such nonconforming use shall not be
resumed, except with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.



      (4)   No nonconforming structure shall be moved for any reason
for any distance, unless said structure is being removed from the site.



      (5)   Work may be done on any nonconforming structure in any
period of 12 consecutive months. Such work may include ordinary repairs such
as the repair or replacement of non-load bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, provided that the repaired structure has no greater coverage and
contains no greater cubic content than before such repairs.



      (6)   If a nonconforming structure, or portion thereof,
becomes physically unsafe or by reason of its physical condition, shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformance with this
chapter.



   (F)   Nonconforming uses and structures in combination.  Where a
lawful use occupied by a lawful structure existed prior to the effective date
of this chapter, as amended from time-to-time, where one or the other, or
both, do not comply with the requirements imposed by this chapter,
nonconforming combination of use and structure may be continued so long as
they both remain otherwise lawful. Such a combination shall also be subject
to the following provisions:



      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by
this chapter shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved,
or structurally altered, except to change the use from a legally
nonconforming use to a conforming use, in which case, such modifications
shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.



      (2)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure
and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the legally nonconforming status of the use, in which case, both
the structure and the use shall be brought into conformance with the
provisions of this chapter, as amended from time-to-time.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS



§ 153.045  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).



   (A)   Open space requirement.  A PUD shall contain permanently
reserved land suitable for the common use of the public or the owners within
the PUD. This may be accomplished by dedication, covenant, or easement. Said
open space may be comprised of non-buildable land as the result of
topography, soil conditions, wetlands, and the like. The open space shall
constitute a minimum of 10% of the gross acreage less rights of way. This
land may be used for recreational or scenic open space, or as a landscaped
buffer as approved by the Commission. This land may also be set aside as
sites for future public facilities. Provisions for permanent control and
maintenance of this land shall be outlined in a form acceptable by the Plan
Commission.



   (B)   Types. For the purpose of administering and enforcing this
chapter, there shall be two types of PUDs: residential and mixed-use.



      (1)   Residential PUD development requirements. The following
standards shall be used in designing and developing all residential PUDs:



         (a)   Residential PUDs shall be permissible on tracts of
land of at least five acres.



         (b)   Permissible types of residential uses within a
residential PUD shall be prescribed by the applicable PUD district ordinance
as approved by the Plan Commission and the Common Council.



         (c)   In any residential PUD, the minimum lot and
setback requirements of the initial zoning district may be reduced, provided
that each lot is at least 7,000 square feet with a minimum width of 60 feet.
To the extent practicable, all perimeter lots shall be sized and oriented so
as to provide a reasonable transition between the residential uses of the PUD
and any adjacent land uses.



         (d)   In the event that a residential PUD is to be
located adjacent to a single-family neighborhood, all two-family or
multi-family portions of a residential PUD should be located nearer the
interior of the development rather than the periphery of the tract.



      (2)   Mixed-use PUD development requirements. The following
standards shall be followed in designing and developing all mixed-use PUDs:



         (a)   Mixed-use PUDs shall be permissible on tracts of
land of at least five acres.



         (b)   Permissible types of uses within a mixed-use PUD
shall be prescribed by the applicable PUD district ordinance as approved by
the Plan Commission.



         (c)   Within any tract of land developed as a mixed-use
PUD, a minimum of 50% of the buildable land shall be developed for
single-family detached dwellings. Not more than 30% of the buildable area may
be developed for two-family or multi-family dwellings. Not more than  20% of
the total buildable area may be developed for non -residential uses.



         (d)   The site development plans and construction plans
for any proposed mixed-use PUD shall indicate the particular portions of the
tract that the developer intends to develop for each use. One plan shall be
approved for the mixed-use PUD; however, for the purposes of determining the
substantive regulations that apply to the mixed-use PUD, each portion of the
tract so designated shall then be treated as if it were a separate district,
zoned to permit respectively higher density residential, lower density
residential or business uses.



         (e)   The non-residential portions) of any mixed-use PUD
may not be occupied until of the residential portions of the development are
substantially completed, unless a performance bond and/or maintenance
guarantee are in effect. The guarantee shall be done in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The purpose and intent of this provision is to
ensure that the mixed use PUD procedure is not used, intentionally or
unintentionally, to create non-residential uses in areas generally zoned for
residential uses except as part of an integrated and well-planned, mixed-use
development.



   (C)   Application. The application for a PUD shall be submitted to
the Plan Commission on a form approved by the Plan Commission. This drawing
shall include details, as required by the Commission, including the location
of properties within 300 feet of the proposed PUD district boundary.



   (D)   PUD district ordinances.  PUD district ordinances shall be
adopted and amended in accordance with the following procedures:



      (1)   The Common Council shall adopt and amend PUD district
ordinances in the same manner as a zone map change. Approval of the PUD
district ordinance by the Common Council shall constitute a zone map change
to “PUD.” In the event construction has not begun on the PUD within seven
years from the date of PUD district ordinance approval, the zoning shall
revert to the previous zoning.



      (2)    A PUD district ordinance shall be expressed in either
general terms or detailed terms. At the initial public hearing, the Plan
Commission shall make a finding as to whether the PUD is expressed in either
general or detailed terms.



      (3)   If the PUD ordinance is expressed in detailed terms, a
secondary review of the PUD ordinance shall not be required, provided that
the ordinance specifies any and all plan documentation or supporting
information that must be supplied before an Improvement Location Permit for
any structure within the PUD district is issued, Secondary approval of a PUD
ordinance shall also constitute final plat approval.



      (4)   If the PUD district ordinance is expressed in general
terms, a secondary review of the PUD district ordinance, which shall specify
any plan documentation or supporting information that must be supplied in

ENFORCEMENT



§ 153.065  ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.



   The Director of Planning and Community Development ("Director") or an
authorized designee is hereby designated to enforce the terms and provisions
of this chapter as provided herein. As used herein, the term PLANNING
DIRECTOR or DIRECTOR shall be inclusive of an authorized designee.



   (A)   Complaints regarding violations.  Whenever the Director
receives a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter or has reason to
suspect that a violation is occurring, the Director shall investigate the
complaint or suspicion and shall take whatever action is warranted in
accordance with these enforcement provisions.



   (B)   Persons liable.  The owner or occupant of any building,
structure, or land, or part thereof, or other person who participates in,
assists, directs, creates, or maintains any condition that is contrary to the
terms of this chapter may be held responsible for the violation, suffer the
penalties, and be subject to the remedies provided herein and at law.



   (C)   Right of entry.  The Director may enter upon any premises at
any reasonable time to inspect all buildings, structures, and premises within
the jurisdiction of this chapter to determine compliance with the provisions
of this chapter. All inspections shall be subject to the following standards
and conditions:



      (1)   The Director shall furnish to the owner, tenant, or
occupant of the building, structure, or premises sought to be inspected
sufficient identification and information to verify that the person is a
representative of the city and to identify the purpose of the inspection.



      (2)   If the owner, tenant, or occupant refuses to grant
entry, the Director may obtain the assistance of law enforcement and/or the
courts for securing entry.



   (D)   Procedures upon discovery of violations.  If the Director
determines that any provision of this chapter is being violated, he shall
provide a written notice to correct to the persons responsible for the
violation. However, if the Director determines that corrective action is
required immediately, he may proceed with the appropriate action without
first issuing a notice to correct, as provided in division (D)(2) below.



      (1)   Notice to correct.



         (a)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) below, upon
determining that a violation of the terms of this chapter exists, the
Director shall issue to the person or persons responsible for the violation a
written notice to correct. The notice to correct shall be delivered by
personal delivery, certified mail return receipt requested, or regular U.S.
Mail. Delivery by mail shall be made to the owner of the property at the
address of record at the Office of the Montgomery County Auditor, and the
owner shall be deemed to have received notices mailed to that address.
Delivery to any other person responsible for the violation may be made to the
address of the property at issue. If delivery is made by mail, service shall
be deemed to have been made two days after the notice is placed in the mail.



         (b)   The notice to correct shall include the following
information:



            1.   The date of the notice;



            2.   The name, business address, and phone number
of the person issuing the notice;



            3.   The name and address of the property owner
and/or responsible party;



            4.   The nature of the violation and the
applicable section(s) of this chapter;



            5.   The date the violation was observed;



            6.   The action necessary to correct the violation;



            7.   That if the violator does not correct the
violation within ten days he shall be subject to a fine citation and the
remedies provided in this section;



            8.   The schedule of fines that may be imposed if
the violation is not timely corrected, and an advisement that each day the
condition remains uncorrected after the time allowed constitutes a separate
violation for which an additional fine may be imposed;



            9.   That, if applicable, the violator may
petition for an appropriate development approval as provided in division (E)
below;



            10.   That the violator may appeal the Director's
determination that a violation exists as provided in division (F) below.



         (c)   1.   After service of a notice to correct, the
violator shall have ten days to correct the condition. However, the Director
may, in his discretion, extend the time for correction if such a request is
made by the violator in writing and within the time originally allowed for
correction. Such a request shall be submitted to the Director and shall
identify a proposed date for completing the corrective action. If the
Director denies the request, the deadline contained in the notice to correct
remains in effect.



            2.   Upon correcting the violation, the violator
shall notify the Director so that the Director may confirm that no further
corrective action is required.



         (d)   If the violation is not timely corrected, the
violator shall be subject to a fine citation and other remedies as provided
herein.



         (e)   A person who receives a notice to correct may
elect to file an application for any available development approval, such as
a request for a variance or a special exception, seeking approval of the
condition at issue. The person must notify the Director of the intent to file
such an application within ten days after the date of service of the notice
to correct. The appropriate application must then be filed within 14 days, or
before the next application deadline, whichever is the greater time, unless
additional time is allowed by the Director. A person who timely files such an
application or petition shall diligently pursue the application or petition.
While the application or petition is pending, additional enforcement action
shall be stayed. If the application or petition is withdrawn, dismissed, or
denied and the violation remains uncorrected, the violator shall be subject
to additional enforcement, including issuance of a fine citation.



         (f)   Appeal of determination of violation.



            1.   The Director's determination that a violation
exists may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Such an appeal must be
filed within ten days after service of the notice to correct and as provided
in division (I) below.



            2.   While an appeal is pending, further
enforcement action shall be stayed.



            3.   If the appeal is withdrawn, dismissed, or
denied and the violation remains uncorrected, the violator shall have ten
days from the withdrawal, dismissal or denial to correct the violation,
unless additional time is allowed as provided in division (D)(1)(c) above.
Failure to correct within this time shall subject the violator to a citation
and all available remedies.



            4.   Failure to file an appeal within the time
provided herein shall operate as a waiver of such an appeal. The waiver is
limited to the determination of a violation, and does not preclude any
available appeal of further action relating to the violation.



      (2)   Enforcement without prior written notice to correct. 
In cases where delay would prevent the effective enforcement of this section
or would pose a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the Director
may seek enforcement by invoking any penalties or remedies authorized herein
or by law without first issuing a written notice to correct. Those remedies
can include, but may not be limited to, a stop work order and/or a fine
citation.



   (E)   Fine citation.  If a violation identified in a notice to
correct is not timely corrected, the Director may issue a fine citation to
the violator. When a citation is issued, fines shall be imposed beginning the
day the citation is issued and shall continue accruing daily thereafter,
without further notice, until the condition is corrected. Each day a
violation remains uncorrected after issuance of a citation results in an
additional fine without any further notices to correct or citations.



      (1)   Service of the citation.  A citation shall be delivered
in the same manner as provided in division (D)(1)(a).  If delivery made by
mail, service shall be deemed to have been made two days after the citation
is placed the mail.



      (2)   Content of citation.  The citation shall contain the
following information:



         (a)   The date of the citation;



         (b)   The name, business address, and phone number of
the person issuing the citation;



         (c)   The address of the property at issue;



         (d)   The name and address of the property owner and/or
other responsible party;



         (e)   The nature of the violation and the applicable
section(s) of this chapter;



         (f)   The action necessary to correct the violation;



         (g)   The first date for which a fine is imposed;



         (h)   That each day the violation remains uncorrected
constitutes a violation for which a separate fine will be assessed, without
further notice or citation;



         (i)   The amount of the fine(s) imposed; and



         (j)   An advisement of the right to appeal the fine.



      (3)   Fine schedule.



         (a)   First occurrence of violation.  The monetary fine
for the first occurrence of a violation shall be $100 per day.



         (b)   Recurring violation(s).  For any recurrence of
violation within a 365-day period after correction of the first occurrence,
the following fines shall apply for each day the recurrence remains
uncorrected:



            1.   Second occurrence:  $200.



            2.   Third occurrence:  $400.



            3.   Fourth occurrence:  $600.



            4.   Fifth occurrence:  $1,000.



            5.   Each occurrence in excess of five:  $2,500.



         (c)   Each day a violation remains uncorrected shall be
a distinct and separate violation and subject to an additional fine, in the
amounts provided above, without further notice or citation.



         (d)   Waiver or reduction of fines.  In his discretion
and for good cause, the Director may waive or reduce fines upon correction of
a violation.



      (4)   Payment, adjudication, and appeal.



         (a)   A person to whom a citation is issued may elect to
do one of the following:



            1.   Pay all fines due to the City Clerk-Treasurer
within 30 days of the citation.



            2.   File an appeal with the Board of Zoning
Appeals as provided in division (I) below. Such an appeal is limited to the
amount of the fine assessed. While the appeal is pending, further enforcement
action and further fines shall be stayed.



            3.   Stand trial for the citation by notifying the
Director of such intent, in writing, within ten days after issuance of the
citation.



               a.   Upon receipt of a notice of intention
to stand trial, additional fines shall be stayed pending resolution of the
alleged violation.



               b.   Upon receipt of a notice of intention
to stand trial, the Director shall initiate appropriate action to enforce the
citation in court.



               c.   If the court determines that the
condition is not a violation or if the case is dismissed, no fines are owed.
If the court affirms the alleged violation, fines resume accruing the day
following the court decision or dismissal.



         (b)   If the violator neither timely pays all amounts
due under a citation, files an appeal with the BZA, nor elects to stand
trial, the Director may commence an enforcement action in court.



      (5)   Other remedies reserved.



         (a)   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this
section does not preclude the Zoning Director, the city, the Plan Commission,
or the Board of Zoning Appeals from seeking alternative and additional relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise provided by law or by
this section.



         (B)   Pursuant to IC 36-1-6-2, if a condition exists on

         (a)   The stop work order shall:



            1.   Be posted on the property in a conspicuous

seek the revocation of any development approval previously granted either
administratively or by any city board, commission, or committee under this

         (b)   Hearing.  If the approval sought to be revoked
originally required a public hearing, then the appropriate Board or
Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed revocation. If the
approval did not require a public hearing, a public hearing is not required
on the revocation. The meeting or public hearing of the appropriate Board or
Commission shall be held not less than 30 days after delivery of the notice
of intent to revoke. Notice of the meeting or public hearing shall be
provided to the public and/or surrounding property owners in the same manner
as would be required for an original petition for the approval at issue.



         (c)   Decision.  At the close of its consideration of
the proposed revocation, the Board or Commission shall render its decision.
The Board or Commission shall also enter written findings of fact supporting
the decision. The Director shall provide a copy of the decision to the
approval holder within ten days of the decision.



      (3)   Procedure for administrative revocation.  The Director
may revoke any approval granted administratively, as set forth above, as

which was granted administratively should be revoked, he shall deliver to the
holder of the approval or permit a written notice of the revocation. The
notice shall identify the reason(s) for the revocation and shall advise the
recipient of the right to seek review of the decision by submitting an appeal
to the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in division (I) below. This notice
shall be delivered in the same manner as provided in division (G)(2)(a) above.

notices, and decisions concerning the revocation of any prior approval shall
be kept with the original development file.



   (H)   Common nuisance.  Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1012, any structure,
land, or premises found to be in violation of this chapter is hereby declared
to be a common nuisance. In addition to any other fine or civil penalty, any
owner or possessor of the structure, land, or premises may be liable for
maintaining a common nuisance.



   (I)   Appeals of Director decisions.



      (1)   Except as may be otherwise provided in this section all
decisions of the Director may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with the procedures and standards for appeals of administrative
decisions.



      (2)   Decisions of any board or commission acting under this
section may be appealed by a request for judicial review under IC 36-7-4-1600
et seq.

entity subject to an enforcement action as provided herein, shall be liable
for the city's costs of enforcement, including any court costs and reasonable
attorney fees.



   (K)   Private remedies reserved.  The terms of this section shall
not be interpreted to prevent any person entitled to relief in law or equity
due to a violation of this chapter from bringing an appropriate action to
secure relief.

   (G)   Proximity to a public right-of-way.  No space shall be so
located that any part intended for occupancy for sleeping purposes shall be
within 50 feet of the right-of-way line of any freeway, express way or
collector street, or within 25 feet of the right-of-way of any minor street.



   (H)   Proximity to a property line.  Travel trailers and stands
must be set back at least 15 feet when adjacent to a property line and 25

§ 153.077  HOME OCCUPATIONS.



   The standards for home occupations are intended to insure:



   (A)   That the home occupation is compatible with the other
permitted uses and the overall residential character of the area; and



   (B)   That the home occupation is clearly secondary and incidental
to the residential use of the principal building. In addition to the use as a
secondary or incidental use in relation to the residential use of the
principal building, a home occupation may be permitted as a special exception
use if it complies with the following:



      (1)   Operation.  The home occupation shall be carried on by
a member of the family residing in the dwelling unit with not more than one
employee who does not reside at the residence.



      (2)   Character.  All home occupations shall be undetectable
from outside the dwelling, and in no way shall the appearance of the
structure be altered to cause the premises to differ from its residential
character. The home occupation shall be carried on wholly within the
principal or permitted accessory structure.



      (3)   Outside storage.  There shall be no outside storage of
any kind related to the home occupation.



      (4)   Traffic and parking generation.  No home occupation
shall generate the need for commercial vehicles for the delivery of materials
to, or the pick-up of finished products from, the premises other than
commercial vehicles which are typically associated with residential delivery,
such as postal or parcel service vehicles. In no instance shall a home
occupation create adverse traffic or parking problems.



      (5)   Hours of operation.  The operation of the home
occupation shall begin no earlier than 6:00 a.m. and end no later than 10:00
p.m., unless otherwise stated in the special exception use permit issued by
the Board of Zoning Appeals.



      (6)   Effects on the fire rating.  In no instance shall a
home occupation alter or involve construction features, or the use of
electrical or mechanical equipment, that would change the fire rating of the
principal structure or the fire district in which the principal structure is
located.



      (7)   Signage.  Refer to the signage standards prescribed by
this chapter.

businesses; or



      (2)   Within 750 feet of the property line of any church,
public or parochial school, library, public park, or county courthouse, or
the boundary line of any residential zoning district or agriculture zoning
district within the jurisdiction of the Crawfordsville Plan Commission.



   (B)   Distance between two adult entertainment businesses.  The
distance between one adult entertainment business and another adult
entertainment business shall be measured in a straight line, without regard
to intervening structures or objects, from the closest property line of each
such business.



   (C)   Distance between an adult entertainment business and
institutional uses.  The distance between an adult entertainment business
and any church, public or parochial school, library, public park, county
courthouse, residential zoning district or agriculture zoning district shall
be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects, from the closest property line of the adult entertainment business
to the nearest property line of the church, public or parochial school,
library, public park or county courthouse, or the nearest boundary line of
the residence zoning district or agriculture zoning district.



   (D)   Adult entertainment businesses as a part of an integrated
center.  If any adult entertainment business is part of or included within
an integrated center, only the portion of said center or leased space
occupied by such adult entertainment business shall be included in
determining the closest property line of said adult entertainment business.

signs must be separated from other electronic changeable copy signs,
electronic graphic display signs or video display signs by at least 35 feet;



      (5)   Orientation.  When located within 150 feet of a
residential use located in a residential district, or a historic district,
all parts of the electronic changeable copy sign must be oriented so that no
portion of the sign face is visible from an existing or permitted principal
structure on that lot;



      (6)   Duration. In any non-residential, non-historic district,
any portion of the message must have a minimum duration of eight seconds and
must be a static display. No portion of the message may flash, scroll, twirl,
change color, fade in or out or in any manner imitate movement; and



      (7)   Audio or pyrotechnics. Audio speakers or any form of
pyrotechnics are prohibited in association with an electronic changeable copy
sign.



   (H)   Signage for businesses in residential neighborhoods.
Businesses operating in residentially zoned neighborhoods, either by virtue
of being in continuous operation prior to the adoption of the city’s
original zoning code (“grandfathered” business) or with the explicit
approval of the city by variance or special exception, must ensure that any
signage comports with the character of the surrounding residential structures
and neighborhood, as well as complies with the requirements of the city’s
signage standards and regulations, §§ 153.090et seq. Because the character
of particular neighborhoods varies throughout the city, and because the
circumstances of each such business are unique, the Board of Zoning Appeals
is hereby authorized to establish specific conditions and restrictions as to
any and all signage of such businesses pursuant to the Boards’ power under
I.C. 36-7-4-918.2 to impose reasonable conditions to its approvals.

result in a civil zoning violation.

§ 153.099  SIGN INSPECTION.



   Signs for which a permit is required are subject to periodic
inspections by the Planning Director in order to determine compliance with
the provisions of this chapter. In the event that the Planning Director
discovers a violation, the Planning Director shall provide the owner with a
written notice of the violation, in accordance with this chapter.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.100  SIGN REMOVAL.

fails to remove the sign, the Planning Director may authorize the removal, or
otherwise cause to be removed, the sign, at cost to the owner or lessee.

calendar year with the exception of social and charitable organization signs
which may not exceed a maximum of 14 calendar days, up to three display
periods in a given calendar year.

§ 153.110  LIGHTING PLAN REQUIREMENT.



   Wherever a site plan review is required by this or any other ordinance,
a lighting plan shall be required. Failure to implement the approved lighting
plan shall be a civil zoning violation. The lighting plan shall be drawn to

and foot-candles of all proposed lighting fixtures and structures (building
mounted and free-standing), including the overall height, type of lamp and
luminaries, and property boundary lines.

detrimental to adjacent properties. For non-residential uses along arterial
roads, the illumination shall be 1.2 foot-candles, for collector streets 0.8
foot-candles, and for local streets 0.6 foot-candles as measured at the
property line. In instances where a non-residential use abuts a residential

sought.



      (2)   The request for the appeal is because of unique

is recorded in the Montgomery County Recorder’s office and indexed under

§ 153.132  AMENDMENTS TO ZONING CODE AND ZONING MAP.



   (A)   General. Two procedures to amend this chapter and one
procedure to amend the zoning maps are established, as follows:



      (1)   Petitions requesting a total replacement or a total
repeal to this chapter, including amendments and zoning maps, may only be
initiated by the Plan Commission. The procedure for this type of petition
shall be governed by I.C. 36-7-4-602(a) and 36-7-4-606.



      (2)   Petitions requesting an amendment or repeal to part of
the text of this chapter may only be initiated by the Plan Commission or the
Common Council. The procedure for this type of petition shall be governed by
I.C. 36-7-4-602 (b) and 36-7-4-607.



      (3)   Petitions requesting a change to the zoning maps
(rezoning) may only be initiated by the Plan Commission, the Common Council
or by a petition signed by property owners who own at least 50% of the land
involved. The procedure for this type of petition shall be governed by I.C.
36-7-4-602 (c) and 36-7-4-608.



   (B)   Rezoning application process. The petition process for a
rezoning initiated by a majority of property owners is as follows:



      (1)   A rezoning shall be applied for in writing on a form
provided by the Plan Commission.



      (2)   Every petition for a rezoning shall be accompanied by
the following:



         (a)   All applicable fees, as established in the city
official fee schedule;



         (b)   A list of affected parties;



         (c)   A legal description of the property; and



         (d)   A site plan, drawn to scale, and on paper not less
than 17 inch x 21 inch nor more than 30 inch x 36 inch, showing the location
of the proposed land to be rezoned in respect to surrounding properties. This
drawing shall include details, as required by the Commission, of the land
uses within 300 feet of the land to be rezoned.



      (3)   The Plan Commission shall hear and determine all
rezoning petitions during a public hearing.



      (4)   The disposition of the rezoning shall be by an
affirmative vote of the Commission and shall be covered by Commission Rules
of Procedure adopted by resolution.



   (C)   Rezoning findings of fact. All rezoning must be recommended to
the Council only upon a determination in writing that the Plan Commission has
considered the following:



      (1)   Whether the rezoning will fulfill a public need for that
type of land use.



      (2)   Whether the rezoning is appropriate in the area
requested or if the public interest would be better served by rezoning
another area of the jurisdiction.



      (3)   Whether the rezoning conforms to the future land use map
in the Comprehensive Plan.



      (4)   Whether the new land use will complement the present and
future traffic flows or would the rezoning cause an adverse impact.



      (5)   Whether adequate off street parking will be provided if
the rezoning request is granted.



      (6)   Whether potential inconveniences and nuisances (such as
noise, lights, odors, and the like) of the rezoning request on adjacent
landowners have been adequately considered.



      (7)   Whether there are adequate public utilities and services
available to the land if rezoned; and whether the local government will have
to pay the cost of any such installation.



      (8)   Whether it is assured that the rezoning request is not
spot zoning, a violation of precedents, or arbitrary and capricious.



   (D)   Council action required.  Once the Commission gives a
recommendation on a rezoning, it must certify its recommendation to the
Council within ten days of such decision. The Council has ninety days from
the date the Commission certifies its recommendation in which to take final
action on the proposal. Final action shall be the adoption, or rejection of a
prepared ordinance; however, if the Council fails to take final action or act
on the proposal within such 90-day period, the proposal shall be approved as
certified by the Plan Commission.



   (E)   Speculative rezoning prohibited. In all cases where a rezoning
is initiated by a majority of property owners, the petition shall be
requested because of a committed and planned project. The Plan Commission
shall consider the criteria in division (C) above based upon the planned
project. All such rezoning petitions where there is no commitment and/or
planned project shall be considered speculative and shall be prohibited.



   (F)   Permits for projects where a rezoning was requested and
granted.  In cases where a rezoning is initiated by a majority of property
owners, and where an ILP or building permit is requested for a project which
is inconsistent with the findings of the approved rezoning, the ILP or
building permit shall be denied by the Planning Director.



(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)



§ 153.133  FEES.



   (A)   General.  Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of
administration, inspections, publication of notice in all local newspapers
and similar matter may be charged to applications and petitions filed
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter requiring plan commission, board
of zoning appeals, or the Planning Director’s approval. To this end, the
fees established by the city official fee schedule shall apply.



   (B)   Waivers.



      (1)   ILP fee waived. In specific cases where a building
permit and an ILP are required for a single, identical project, the ILP fee
shall be waived. However, all building permit fees shall be paid.



      (2)   Interdepartmental applications. From time to time city
departments may file for a permit required by this chapter. The fees
associated with such permit or permits may be waived by the Planning
Director. The Planning Director shall document said reason for waiving the
applicable fee.



   (C)   Other conditions.  The following conditions shall also apply:



      (1)   No part of any fee paid pursuant to this section shall
be returnable to the applicant or petitioner nor transferable to another
application or petition.



      (2)   Any person riling a petition for Plan Commission or
Board of Zoning Appeals action shall assume the cost of public notice that is
required.



      (3)   No application or petition shall be considered nor any
permit issued unless the required fee is paid in full.



   (D)   Publication of planning documents.  In addition to this
chapter and the Subdivision Control Ordinance being codified along with all
other chapters of the Municipal Code, these chapters shall also be published
as separate documents available for public sale. Under no circumstances shall
these separately published versions be considered to be official. The
official version of the municipal code is found in the Code of Ordinances,
published by the American Legal Publishing Corporation. The comprehensive
plan and zoning maps shall also be published and available for sale. The fees
for these documents are as established by the city official fee schedule.

36-7-4-1000. Specifically, the various bodies shall be subject to the
following reviews:

Commission concerning subdivision plats or planned developments may be
reviewed by certiorari. Any decision or requirement of the Plan Commission
concerning a recommendation to the Council may not be reviewed.



   (B)   BZA. Any decision or requirement of the BZA made under the
authority of this chapter may be reviewed by certiorari.

official fee schedule.

§ 154.01  PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.



   (A)   Purpose of historic preservation and protection.  In order to
promote the educational, cultural and general welfare of the citizens of the
city and to insure the harmonious and orderly growth and development of the
municipality; to maintain established residential neighborhoods in danger of
having their distinctiveness destroyed; to enhance property values and
attract new residents; to ensure the viability of the traditional downtown
area and to enhance tourism within the city; it is deemed essential by the
city that qualities relating to its history and harmonious outward appearance
of its structures be preserved.  This purpose is advanced through the
restoration and preservation of historic areas and buildings, the
construction of compatible new buildings where appropriate, and the
maintenance and insurance of compatibility in regards to style, form,
proportion, texture, and material between historic buildings and those of
contemporary design. It is the intention of the city through this chapter to
preserve and protect historic and architecturally worthy buildings,
structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods which impart a
distinct aesthetic quality to the City and serve as visible reminders of its
historic heritage.



   (B)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



      ALTERATION.  A material or color change in the external
architectural features of any building, structure, or site within a historic
district.



      CITY.  The City of Crawfordsville, Indiana.



      CLASSIFICATIONS.



         (a)   CONTRIBUTING.  A “C” classification means
that the property is at least 40 years old, but does not meet the criteria
for an “O” or “N” classification.  Such resources are important to
the density or continuity of the area’s historic fabric.  Contributing
structures can be listed on the National Register only as part of an historic
district.



         (b)   NON-CONTRIBUTING.  Property classified as
“NC” is not included in an inventory unless it is located within the
boundaries of a historic district.  Such properties may be less than 50
years old, or they may be older structures that have been altered in such a
way that they have lost their historic character, or they may be otherwise
incompatible with their historic surroundings.  These properties are not
eligible for listing on the National Register.



         (c)   NOTABLE.  A classification of “N” means that
the property does not merit the outstanding rating, but it is still above
average in its importance.  A notable structure may be eligible for the
National Register.



         (d)   OUTSTANDING.  The “O” classification means
that the property has sufficient historic or architectural significance that
is listed, or is eligible for individual listing, in the National Register of
Historic Places. Outstanding resources can be of local, state, or national
importance.



      DEMOLITION.  The complete or substantial removal of any
building, structure, or site located in a historic district.



      HISTORIC DISTRICT.  A single building, structure, object, or
site of a concentration of buildings, structures, objects, spaces, or sites,
the boundaries of which are described or delineated on a map approved in an
ordinance adopted under this title.



      INTERESTED PARTY.  One of the following:



         (a)   The Mayor;



         (b)   The City Council;



         (c)   The City Plan Commission;



         (d)   A neighborhood association, whether incorporated
or unincorporated, a majority of whose members are residents of a historic
district designated by an ordinance adopted under this chapter;



         (e)   An owner or occupant of property located in a
historic district established by an ordinance adopted under this chapter;



         (f)   Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, Inc., or
any of its successors; or



         (g)   The state historic preservation officer designated
under IC 14-3-3.4-10.



      PRESERVATION GUIDELINES.  Criteria, locally developed, which
identify local design concerns in an effort to assist property owners in
maintaining the character of the designated district or buildings during the
process of rehabilitation or new construction.



      PRIMARY AREA.  The principal area of historic and/or
architectural significance within a historic district as delineated on the
map establishing the boundaries of the historic district.



      ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  Work for which no certificate of
appropriateness is required.



      SECONDARY AREA.  An area in a historic district delineated on
the map establishing the boundaries of the historic district that is adjacent
to a primary area and which has a visual relationship to the primary area and
could affect the preservation of the primary area. The purpose of designating
a secondary area is to assure its compatibility and harmony with an adjacent,
primary area.



      STREETSCAPE.  Appearance from a public way, the distinguishing
characteristics of which are created by the width of the street and
sidewalks, their paving materials and color, the design of the street
furniture (e.g., street lights, trash receptacles, benches, and the like) use
of plant materials such as trees and shrubs, and the setback, mass, and
proportion of those buildings which enclose the street.



      VISUAL COMPATIBILITY.  Those elements of design that meet the
guidelines set out in § 154.08.

§ 154.04  HISTORIC DISTRICTS, CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND GUIDELINES.



   (A)   All recommendations for the establishment of a historic
district shall be in the form of a written report and must be based on the
criteria outlined in this section.  A recommendation for establishing a
historic district may be initiated from either of the following two sources:



      (1)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit
historic district maps for the City Council approval.



      (2)   Owners of property wishing to establish a historic
district which includes their property may petition the Commission to
consider drawing and submitting a map or maps of said property to the City
Council for its approval. The Commission may establish in its rules criteria
to be met before it considers a petition.



   (B)   The Commission may recommend, and the City Council may provide
that the establishment of an historic district shall occur in two phases. 
During the first phase, which continues for a period of three years from the
date this chapter is adopted, a certificate of appropriateness is required
for the following activities: the demolition of any building; the moving of
any building; and any new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way.



      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the
first phase of conservation district continues and the second phase does not
become effective if a majority of the property owners in the district object
to the Commission, in writing, to the requirement that certificates of
appropriateness be issued for the following activities:



         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of
historic buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance
involving exterior color changes;



         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of
walls and fences, if along public ways;



         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of
nonhistoric buildings subject to view from a public way by additions,
reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.



      (2)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must
be received by the Commission not earlier than 180 days or later than 60 days
before the third anniversary of the adoption of this chapter.



   (C)   In order to establish a historic district, the Commission
shall first prepare a map describing the district in accordance with the
following:



      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the
Commission which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located
within the city.



      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a
property containing a single building, structure, or site.



      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and
secondary areas as follows:



         (a)   Primary area.  The principal of historic and
architectural significance.



         (b)   Secondary area.  An area adjacent to a primary
area which has a visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the
preservation of the primary area.  The purpose of designating a secondary
area is to assure its compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.



   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall classify and designate on the
snap all buildings, structures, and sites within each historic district
described on the map. Buildings, structures, and sites shall be classified as
historic or nonhistoric.  Historic buildings, structures, and sites must
possess identified historic or architectural merit of a degree warranting
their preservation.  The Commission shall further classify and designate all
buildings and structures within a proposed historic district as follows:



         (a)   Outstanding;



         (b)   Notable; or



         (c)   Contributing.



      (2)   Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites are those
not classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other classifications, the
Commission may devise its own system of further classification of historic
buildings, structures, and sites.



   (E)   Before a historic district is established and the building
classifications take effect, the map setting forth the district’s
boundaries and building classifications must be submitted to, and approved in
an ordinance by, the City Council.



   (F)   The map establishing boundaries of a historic district may be
recorded in the Office of the County Recorder.

§ 154.05  INTERIM PROTECTION.



   (A)   When submitting a map to the City Council under § 154.04, the
Commission may declare one  or more buildings or structures that are
classified and designated as historic on the map to be under interim
protection.



   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building,
structure, or site to be under interim protection under this section, the
Commission shall, by personal delivery or first class mail, provide the owner
or occupant of the building, structure or site with a written notice of the
declaration.  The written notice must:



      (1)   Cite the authority of the Commission to put the
building, structure, or site under interim protection under this section;



      (2)   Explain the effect of putting the building, structure,
or site under interim protection; and



      (3)   Indicate that the interim protection is temporary.



   (C)   A building or structure put under interim protection under
division (A) remains under interim protection until the map is:



      (1)   Submitted to; and



      (2)   Approved in an ordinance or rejected by the City Council.



   (D)   While a building, structure, or site is under interim
protection under this section:



      (1)   The building, structure, or site may not be demolished
or moved; and



      (2)   The exterior appearance of the building, structure, or
site may not be conspicuously changed by:



         (a)   Addition;



         (b)   Reconstruction; or



         (c)   Alternation.



   (E)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at
any time during the period of interim protection, provided the proposed
change meets the criteria for considering the effect of actions on the
historic buildings in § 154.05(D) and any proposed preservation guidelines
prepared for the building, structure, or site, but the certificate of
appropriateness shall have no effect, or no action may be taken pursuant
thereto, unless the map including the building, structure or site is approved
by the City Council.



(Ord. 10-2002, passed 5-13-02)

if the applicant agrees to it.  The Commission must report its findings and
the reasons for its decision in written form, and supply the applicant with a
copy of its report.  A copy of the certificate of appropriateness must be
submitted with the application for a building or demolition permit; no
building or demolition permit shall be issued unless a copy of the
certificate of appropriateness is provided by the applicant with the

   (D)   Criteria for considering effect of actions on historic
buildings.  The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any
reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, or moving of a historic building,
structure, site or any part of or appurtenance to such building or structure,
including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, paving, and signs shall
require that such work be done in a manner that will preserve the historical

primary areas.  Within the primary area of a historic district, new
buildings, structures, as well as building, structures, and appurtenances
that are moved, reconstructed, materially altered, repaired, or changed in
color, must be visually compatible with buildings and places to which they
are visually related generally in terms of the following visual compatibility
factors:



      (1)   Height.  The height of proposed buildings must be
visually compatible with adjacent buildings.



      (2)   Proportion of building’s front facade.  The

relationship of a building to the open space between it and adjoining
buildings must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to
which it is visually related.



      (6)   Rhythm of entrances and porch projections.  The
relationship of entrances and porch projections of a building to sidewalks
must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it
is visually related.

relationship of the materials, texture, and color of the facade of a building
must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it
is visually related.



      (8)   Roof shapes.  The roof shape of a building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is
visually related.



      (9)   Wall of continuity.  Appurtenances of a building or
site, such as walls, wrought iron fences, evergreen landscaped masses, and
building facades, must form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street, if
necessary to ensure visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and
places to which it is visually related.



      (10)   Scale of the building.  The size of a building, and
the building mass of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door
openings, porches, and balconies must be visually compatible with the

of earning an economic return on its value, as appraised by a licensed real
estate appraiser.



   (C)   Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period
fixed by the commission, based on the Commission’s classification on the

   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prevent
the ordinary repairs and maintenance of any building, structure, or site,
provided that such repairs or maintenance do not result in a conspicuous
change in the design, form, proportion, mass, configuration, building
material, texture, color, location, or external visual appearance of any
structure, or part thereof.

§ 156.01  STATUTORY AUTHORITY.



   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and IC 14-28-4 granted the
power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of Crawfordsville does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Crawfordsville are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase erosion or flood damage;



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands; and



   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 159.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in floodplains;



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
flood blight areas; and



   (G)   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property
is in a flood area.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.05  DEFINITIONS.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.



   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding
is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both, in A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as ZONE A, ZONE AE,
ZONES A1-A30, ZONE AO, ZONE AH, ZONE AR and ZONE A99 on a FIRM. The
definitions are presented below:



      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the
1% annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood
elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)



      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths
are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.



      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between
one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic
analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.



      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of
an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction
of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it
complete for insurance rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the
flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward
completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure that is
located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use
of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used
for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential.
Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage
sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.



   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition,
which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter
toad-bearing walls, is new construction.



   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.



   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one
to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.



   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.



   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.



   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.



   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   DEVELOPMENT.

unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.



   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, means the
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The Crawfordsville Common Council requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval
of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional
hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without
granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires
the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use
than originally intended.



   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a

and Structures.



   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required
to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local
flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal
and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after
June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.

the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to
doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls having a total net
area of one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The
bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the
exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher; and



         (b)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the
parking of vehicles and building access.

between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual
cash value), or adjusted assessed values.



   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term
risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
MITIGATION is two fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
cost of disaster response and recovery.

that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or
occupancy in flood prone areas.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdictions
of the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the
City of Crawfordsville are generally identified as such on the Montgomery
County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated February 2, 2012. The SFHAs of

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or
any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.



   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.



   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter,
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter
where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.



   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.



   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.



   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
SHADED X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). UNSHADED X ZONES (C Zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.



   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.



   ZONE A. (See definition for A ZONE.)



   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of
moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND
C.)

§ 156.06  LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.



   This chapter shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas
within the jurisdiction of the City of Crawfordsville.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.07  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.



   This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees
with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering
study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.



   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits
for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Crawfordsville shall be as
delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study of Montgomery County and Incorporated Areas dated February 2, 2012 and
the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated February 2, 2012.



   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits
for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Crawfordsville, delineated
as an “A Zone” on the Montgomery County and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
dated February 2, 2012, shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the
upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.



   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.08  ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.



   A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with
the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.09  COMPLIANCE.



   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within
the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.10  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.11  DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND
ELEVATIONS.



   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base
flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the
SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner
should be advised to apply for a LOMA.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.12  INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions
shall be:



   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;



   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.13  WARNING; DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of Crawfordsville, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.14  INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).



   In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC
coverage as a repetitive loss structure, the National Reform Act of 1994
requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and
incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending
on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the
cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25%
of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.15  SEVERABILITY.



   If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to
be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then
said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of
this chapter.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.16  EFFECTIVE DATE.

Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of
the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built. Said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. When
floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure said certification shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or
architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of
the certification shall be at the permit holders’ risk. (The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the lowest floor and floodproofing elevation
survey data submitted.) The permit holder shall correct deficiencies detected
by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to
submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall
be cause to issue a stop work order for the project.

         (a)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit
or approval, issued under the provisions of this chapter, in cases where
there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to the material
fact in the application or plans on which the permit or approval was based.



         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit
upon determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction,
erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or
replacement of the structure for which the permit was issued is in violation
of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.



      (14)   Inspect sites for compliance. For all new and/or
substantially improved buildings constructed in the SFHA, inspect before,
during and after construction. Authorized city officials shall have the right
to enter and inspect properties located in the SFHA.

allowed to take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that
the excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in
the same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will
be accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding
when not inundated by floodwater, and that it shall not be refilled;



      (3)   The excavation shall provide for true storage of
floodwater but shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by
floodwater;



      (4)   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way
leading to the floodplain;

excavated area is accessible to the regulatory floodwater;



      (6)   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed
stable enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and
shall include provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any
increased runoff or drainage resulting from its placement; and



      (7)   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled
shall be submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site
work; once site work is complete, but before the actual start of
construction, the applicant shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a
certified survey of the excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and
excavation comply with this subchapter.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.41  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.



   In all SFHAs, the following provisions are required:



   (A)   In addition to the requirements of § 156.40, all structures

         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions; and



         (d)   Openings are to be not less than three inches in
any direction in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole
in the wall, excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical
foundation air vent device; and



         (e)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and



         (f)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall
not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; and



         (g)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be

the highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction
prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or
dimension contrary to the structure's originally approved design, shall be
presented as a condition of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.



   (E)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or
nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in
accordance with the following:



      (1)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one
foot deep before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with
either the Standard or Modified Proctor Test method.



      (2)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the
foundation of the structure before sloping below the FPG.



      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour
during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative
cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical.



      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties.



      (5)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be

requirements:



      (1)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to ail
manufactured homes to be placed on a site;



         (a)   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;



         (b)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;



         (3)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision; or



         (4)   In an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial
damage” as a result of a flood.



      (2)   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in
height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been
substantially damaged by a flood.



      (3)   Manufactured homes with fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the

         (c)   Meet the requirements for manufactured homes as
stated earlier in this section.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.42  STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.



   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;



   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and

(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.43  CRITICAL FACILITIES.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access
routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.44  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.



   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in § 156.07, are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving, and the like, undertaken before the actual start of
construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial
additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary
river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial
additions/ improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway
without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in
a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.)



   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a
permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
this subchapter have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be
less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.



   (C)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory
flood more than 0.14 of one foot; and



   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.45  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.



   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved
structure shall be at or above the FPG.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.46  STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
AND/OR FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.



   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile.



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square miie, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation
and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.



      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this subchapter have been met.



   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is iess than one square
mile.



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage, area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual
chance flood elevation for the site.



      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
this subchapter have been met.



   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.63  CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.



   (A)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:



      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and



      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights,



additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing laws or ordinances.



   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
§ 156.44 or 156.46(A) may be granted.



   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to § 156.44 or

156.41 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.



   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.



   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration
of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.



   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and
the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the
cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (See § 156.64.)



   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request. (See §

§ 156.65  HISTORIC STRUCTURES.



   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic
structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.



(Ord. 1-2012, passed 1-9-12)



§ 156.66  SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
