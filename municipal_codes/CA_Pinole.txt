1.16.010  FINDINGS.



   A.   Monetary contributions to political campaigns are a legitimate
form of participation in the American political process; however, the
financial strength of certain individuals or organizations should not permit
them to exercise a disproportionate or controlling influence upon the
election of candidates in Pinole.



   B.   The increasing costs of political campaigns compel many
candidates to raise larger percentages of money from interested groups with a
specific financial stake in matters which may come before the Pinole City
Council.  This has caused a public perception that votes may be improperly
influenced by monetary contributions.



   C.   The tendency for campaign contributions to be dominated by a
small number of very large contributors undermines the integrity of the
governmental process, the competitiveness of campaigns, and the public
confidence in local officials and local agencies. (Ord. 2008-06 § 1 (part),
2008)



1.16.020  PURPOSE



   The City Council enacts this chapter to accomplish the following
purposes:



   A.   To improve methods of financing campaigns in order to ensure
the public's right-to-know, combat corruption and undue influence, and
promote citizen participation in the political process.



   B.   To prevent parties with a specific financial interest in the
city's decision from exerting undue influence over those decisions by means
of large campaign contributions.



   C.   To allow candidates and officeholders to spend a lesser
proportion of their time on fund raising and greater proportion of their time
dealing with issues of importance to the city and its residents.



   D.   To improve the disclosure of contribution sources in reasonable
and effective ways.



   E.   To restore public trust in governmental electoral institutions.



   F.   To ensure that independent expenditures were not used to evade
contribution limits.



   G.   To prevent large contributors to independent expenditure
committees from influencing candidates in the same way that candidates are
influenced by large contributors who give to them directly.



   H.   To prevent the corruption or appearance of corruption of
candidates who have been given large contributions by independent expenditure
committees and thus who may be influenced by those large contributions.



   I.   To reduce the political quid pro quo by candidates who might be
more inclined to provide favors and attention to those entities that, without
this chapter, would have contributed large sums to the candidate's campaign
through the independent expenditure intermediary.  (Ord. 2008-06 § 1
(part), 2008)

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT



Sections:



   2.54.010   Findings.



   2.54.020   Purpose, goals and objective.



   2.54.030   Severability.



2.54.010  FINDINGS.



   The City Council finds and determines that:



   A.   Transportation systems management (hereinafter referred to as
“TSM”) has the potential to reduce vehicle trips and vehicle emissions
more efficiently and cost effectively than major roadway improvements.



   B.   For many years prior to the passage of Contra Costa County
Measure C in 1988, local jurisdictions developed and implemented a variety of
TSM and transportation demand management (hereinafter referred to as
“TDM”) projects and programs (e.g., operation of transit systems,
construction of bicycle facilities, land use policy coordination and related
improvements).



   C.   Since 1992, the Contra Costa transportation authority has
committed both Measure C and Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA) funds
to four sub-area programs for the implementation of Measure C and clean air
plan goals.



   D.   Pursuant to the provisions of Measure C, adoption of a TDM
ordinance was deemed to be one component of a comprehensive transportation
planning effort.



   E.   In compliance with the requirements of the TDM ordinance, large
employers were required to develop and implement trip reduction programs at
work sites and, pursuant to those requirements, implementation of the TDM
ordinance was delegated to the West Contra Costa transportation advisory
committee (WCCTAC).



   F.   The countywide comprehensive transportation plan incorporates
each regional committee's action plan for routes of regional significance,
which supports specific TSM/TDM goals and objectives.



   G.   Over the past four years, the sub-area TDM programs have been
successful in reducing vehicle trips and emissions at the employment sites
specified in the TDM ordinance, as well as in school and residential areas
where programs have been implemented.



   H.   Since the adoption of the TDM ordinance, TDM efforts have been
expanded to include aspects of the transportation systems other than employer
programs (e.g.,



enhancement of transit and bicycle facilities, incorporation of new
technologies into the system, land use policy coordination, and related
enhancements).



   I.   In adopting the ordinance codified in this chapter, cooperation
and coordination with other local jurisdictions and regions in furthering TSM
are acknowledged as having the potential to enhance the efficiency and
costeffectiveness of its efforts; and, accordingly, the Council of the city
directs staff to take steps to implement TSM in accordance with the policies,
goals and objectives set forth in this chapter, and in cooperation with
WCCTAC staff. (Ord. 97-109 § 3(part), 1997).



2.54.020  PURPOSE, GOALS AND OBJECTIVE.



   A.   Purpose. In light of legislation passed eliminating mandatory
employer-based trip reduction requirements, the following purposes, goals and
objectives are adopted in order to assist staff in implementing this TSM
chapter and TSM programs. The city establishes this TSM chapter:



      1.   To promote maximum efficiency in the existing
transportation system and to further the transportation goals of the Measure
C growth management program, Contra Costa's congestion management program,
the Bay Area clean air plan, and the west county action plan, by:



         a.   Promoting and encouraging the use of transit,
ridesharing, bicycling, walking, flexible work hours and telecommuting as
alternatives to solo driving,



         b.   Incorporating these goals and objectives into the
land use review and planning process,



         c.   Developing proactive programs and/or projects
either alone, in conjunction with other jurisdictions, or with WCCTAC, aimed
at achieving these goals,



         d.   Considering the incorporation of appropriate
technology designed to facilitate traffic flow, provide transit and highway
information, provide trip generation alternatives, and considering the
incorporation of related technology into the transportation system,



         e.   Cooperating with other jurisdictions, the private
sector and transit operators in planning and implementing transportation
programs,



         f.   Educating west county employees, employers,
residents and students regarding the benefits and availability of commute
alternatives,



         g.   Working with the transit authorities to better
serve west Contra Costa County,



         h.   Encouraging the most cost-effective transportation
improvement projects aimed at achieving congestion relief, and



         i.   Cooperating with other jurisdictions and agencies,
the private sector and transit operators in planning and implementing
transportation programs;



      2.   To reflect an ongoing commitment to expand TSM efforts
beyond employer based trip reduction programs, in order to achieve congestion
management and air quality goals; and



      3.   To comply with applicable state and federal laws as well
as with Measure C growth management program requirements pertaining to TSM.



   B.   The goal of this TSM chapter is to ensure the continuation of a
proactive TSM program effort aimed at reducing vehicle trips, vehicle
emissions and traffic congestion in the most efficient and cost effective
manner.



   C.   The objective of this section is to establish the following
policies:



      1.   To participate, in conjunction with other jurisdictions
and WCCTAC, in a proactive effort to support and develop projects which will
achieve the Measure C TSM/TDM goals as described in the west county action
plan, the countywide comprehensive transportation plan, the Measure C
strategic plan, the congestion management plan, and/or the Bay Area clean air
plan. Such participation may include, but need not be limited to:



         a.   Promotion and encouragement of the use of transit,
ridesharing, bicycling, walking, flexible work hours, telecommuting or other
alternatives to solo driving,



         b.   Defining and implementing projects incorporating
appropriate technology designed to facilitate traffic flow, provide transit
and highway information, and related technology;



      2.   To incorporate these goals into the land use review and
planning process. (Ord. 97-109 § 3(part), 1997).



2.54.030  SEVERABILITY. 



   If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or
phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or
invalid, such a decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this chapter. The City Council declares that it would have passed
each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase
of this chapter irrespective of the unconstitutionality or invalidity of any
section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase.
(Ord. 97-109 § 3 (part), 1997).

   A.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code;



   B.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code;



   C.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the
State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and
Use Taxes;



   D.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be
administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with
the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,
minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time
minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 322 § 4, 1973).



3.12.050  CONTRACT WITH STATE.



   Prior to the operative date of the provisions of this chapter, the city
shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions
incident to the administration and operation of this chapter; provided, that
if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization
prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a
case the operative date shall be the dirst day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the
first calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 322 §
5, 1973).



3.12.060  IMPOSITION OF SALES TAX.



   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a
tax is imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section
3.12.020 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible
personal property sold at retail in the city on and after the operative date.
(Ord. 322 § 6, 1973).



3.12.070  PLACE OF SALE.



   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at
the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property
sold is delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state
destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state
destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax,
regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer
has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of
business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall
be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the
State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 322 § 7, 1973).



3.12.080  IMPOSITION OF USE TAX.



   An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in
the city of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and
after the operative date for storage, use or other consumption in the city at
the rate stated in Section 3.12.020 of the sales price of the property. The
sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to
state sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.
(Ord. 322 § 8, 1973).



3.12.090  ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.

are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code are adopted and made a part of this chapter as
though fully set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 322 § 9, 1973).



3.12.100  LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW.

part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State
Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the state of California; the substitution shall not be made
when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against the city, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be
made in those sections, including, but not necessarily  limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the
result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax
with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible
personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while
such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the
state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage,
use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be
subject to tax by the state under the provisions of that code; the
substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last
sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “State” in the
phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Section 6203 or in
the definition of that phrase in Section 6203. (Ord. 322 § 10, 1973).

3.20.010  TITLE – HOW CITED.



   This chapter shall be known as the “impact fee ordinance” and may
be so cited. (Ord. 462 § 1 (part), 1984).



3.20.020  FINDINGS.



   The City Council finds that the potential of new construction of
residential development and business development will have an adverse impact
on existing public streets, highways, public buildings and public services.
Under existing ordinances for the issuance of building permits, the fees
authorized for new developments are disproportionate to the anticipated
impact that will be imposed upon the existing public streets, highways,
public buildings and public services. It is necessary for the public welfare
that an equitable method be established whereby the persons constructing new
residential and business projects pay a fee to fairly offset the additional
financial impact resulting from the described development. (Ord. 462 §
1(part), 1984).



3.20.030  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method for the equitable
and consistent collection of fees for public improvements and facilities
which are needed to serve the city of Pinole because of the impacts of new
development. (Ord. 462 § 1(part), 1984).



3.20.040  STANDARDS.



   The fees as hereinafter set forth have been determined based upon
public hearings, published reports, standards and criteria that included the
following:



   A.   Detailed analysis of projected residential and business growth
based on the existing general plan land use designations. This analysis
assessed the impacts to capital improvements required as a direct result of
new growth; and



   B.   An analysis of the costs for capital improvements required by
the anticipated new growth compared to the projected revenues to be
collected. (Ord. 462 § 1(part), 1984).



3.20.050  DEFINITIONS.



   As used in this chapter:



   A.   BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.  A project consisting of new
construction of one or more buildings or structures of which the major
portion shall be used for business, commercial, office, industrial, warehouse
or similar use.



   B.   RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. A project consisting of new
construction of residential dwellings.



   C.   RESIDENTIAL UNIT.  A single-family residence; each separate
habitation for one or more persons whether in a duplex, multiple dwelling,
condominium or mobile home site. (Ord. 462 § 1(part), 1984).



3.20.060  IMPACT FEE ESTABLISHED.



   The City Council establishes an impact fee for business or residential
development. There is authorized to be imposed upon each applicant for a
building permit for new residential or business development an impact fee
payable to the City of Pinole at the time of issuance of the building permit.
This impact fee shall be in addition to all other charges for approvals and
permits required by other ordinances of the City of Pinole. (Ord. 462 §
1(part), 1984).



3.20.070  CREDITS ALLOWED.



   The Council may in its discretion grant a total or partial credit
against the applicable impact fee where the applicant or his or her
predecessor in interest has otherwise paid in whole or in part for public
facilities for which the impact fee is imposed either through a dedication of
land and/or improvements, developer contribution, payment pursuant to a
development agreement with the city or other jurisdiction, or other means.
(Ord. 462 § 1 (part), 1984).



3.20.080  REFUNDS AND INCREASES.



   If a building permit is vacated, voided, not used or amended after
payment of the related impact fee, the fee will be adjusted to provide for
additional fee or refund depending on whether the use is increased or
decreased. (Ord. 462 § 1(part), 1984).

      8.   Development projects where a building permit has been

The procedures specified in Government Code Sections 66000 et seq., or any
applicable successor statutes, shall be observed prior to the adoption of
such resolution.  (Ord. 2008-03 § 2 (part), 2008)



3.20.094  LAND USE UTILIZED TO COMPUTE FEE.



   A.   New development or development projects shall be classified
into one (1) of the following types of uses, and shall pay the impact fee

3.20.096  AMOUNT OF IMPACT FEE.



   A.   The specific amount of impact fees created to fund the public
facilities specified in Section 3.20.093 shall be initially set forth by a
resolution of the city council adopting a development impact fee schedule
(the "schedule").  The schedule may be amended annually or from time to time
in accordance with the procedures and based upon the findings for such fees
set forth in Government Code Section 66000 et seq., or any applicable
successor statutes.



   B.   On July 1st of each fiscal year, beginning in July 2008, the
Director of Finance, or his/her designee shall make annual adjustments to the
dollar amounts on the schedule by a percentage equal to the percentage change
in the "Engineering News Record's Construction Cost Index-San Francisco Bay
Area" for the preceding twelve (12) month period calculated from April 1 to
March 31.  This adjustment will offset the effects of inflation-related
construction cost increases (or any deflation related decreases).  If this
index should cease publication, the Director of Finance shall use any
appropriate official index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or
successor, or similar agency as may then exist or may then may be most nearly
equivalent thereto.  Land costs may be evaluated annually and adjusted as
necessary based on the current market conditions at the time.  The Director
of Finance shall present the new schedule for adoption by resolution of the
City Council after at least one (1) public hearing.



   C.   At least once every five (5) years the City Council shall
review the basis for the impact fees to determine whether fees are still
reasonably related to the needs of new development.  If it is necessary to
update the previously approved fee study to do so, the City Council may
amortize the cost of doing so over the following five (5)-year period and
include such cost as an element of the impact fees.  (Ord. 2008-03 § 2
(part), 2008).



3.20.097  PURPOSE AND USE OF IMPACT FEES.



   A.   The impact fees established pursuant to this section and
collected pursuant to the adopted schedule shall be expended only for the
public facilities for which they were imposed, calculated and collected. 
The impact fees may also be used to pay the principal, interest and other
costs of bonds, notes and other obligations issued or undertaken by or on
behalf of the city to finance such public facilities.



   B.   The impact fees may also be used to reimburse the city for the
costs associated with the administration and implementation of the impact fee
program and to make refunds as required by Government Code Section 66001 or
any applicable successor statute.  (Ord. 2008-03 § 2 (part), 2008)



3.20.098  IMPOSITION AND PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES.



   A.   Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this section
or any amendment or resolution adopted hereunder, the city shall impose the
impact fee as a condition of approval of all new development or development
projects.



   B.   In the case of non-residential new development or development
projects, the impact fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building
permit for construction of any part of the project.



   C.   Unless earlier payment is permitted pursuant to the provisions
of Government Code Section 66007, or any applicable successor statute, the
impact fees for residential developments shall be paid on the date of the
final inspection or on the date the certificate of occupancy is issued,
whichever date occurs first.



   D.   In no event shall a certificate of occupancy be issued for a
new development or development project without payment of the impact fees.



   E.   Whenever impact fees are imposed pursuant to this section, the
city shall provide each applicant for a development permit with a notice in
writing at the time of the approval of the development permit or at the time
of the imposition of the impact fees, a statement of the amount of the fees
and notification of the ninety (90) day approval period in which the
applicant may protest the fees.  Said notice shall be in substantially the
following form:



"The conditions of project approval for your project, identified as
____________________________, include certain fees, dedication requirements,
reservation requirements and/or other exactions more specifically described

the name of the city in any court having jurisdiction of the cause; however,
nothing in this subsection shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any
violation of this section.

Chapter 3.22
SUBREGIONAL TRANSPORTATION MITIGATION PROGRAM



Sections:



   3.22.010   Purpose.



   3.22.020   Findings.



   3.22.030   Fees.



   3.22.040   Project descriptions, funding commitments, and eligible
costs, and implementation schedule



3.22.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the STMP Update and the STMP fee set forth in this
ordinance is to meet the intent of Measure J by levying a fee on new
development to mitigate the regional impacts of new trips generated by that
development. Further, the purpose of the STMP fee set forth in this ordinance
is to raise funds for regional transportation projects in West County.



(Ord. 2019-01 § 1 (part), 2019)



3.22.020  FINDINGS.



   A.   The STMP fee is required to defray all or a portion of the
costs of building transportation capital improvement projects needed to
mitigate impacts of new development projects.



   B.   The STMP fee will raise funds for twenty projects, in the
general categories of freeway and interchange improvements, local street and
intersection improvements, transit and station-related improvements, bicycle
and pedestrian-focused improvements, and complete streets projects. A
detailed description of the projects can be found in Section 3.22.040.



   C.   The total cost of the twenty projects is approximately $855
million in 2018 dollars. The nexus study report determined the amount of
eligible funding that could be collected through the STMP program at $161.8
million.



   D.   The nexus findings, in conformance with Government Code §
66000 et seq. can be found in the "2019 Nexus Update of the Subregional
Transportation Mitigation Program (STMP) Impact Fee" (herein after referred
to as the 2019 STMP Nexus Update) prepared by Fehr & Peers for WCCTAC dated
December 2018. Two copies of the 2019 STMP Nexus Update are on file with the
(City Clerk/Clerk of the Board). 



   E.   The 2019 STMP Nexus Update included the following steps:



      1.   Projecting the amount of new development anticipated in
West County;



      2.   Setting criteria for identifying eligible capital
improvement projects;



      3.   Specifying the transportation improvements needed to
accommodate growth;



      4.   Evaluating the relationship between the improvements, the
share of funding from new development, and the impacts of new trip generation;



      5.   Allocating the costs across land use types; and



      6.   Preparing fee schedules and implementation documents.



   F.   After considering the 2019 STMP Nexus Update, the testimony
received at a noticed public hearing, the agenda statements, the General
Plan, and all correspondence received (together, the "Record"), the [City
Council/Board of Supervisors] approves and adopts the 2019 STMP Nexus Update
and incorporates such report herein.



   G.   Adoption of the STMP fee set forth in this ordinance, as it
relates to development within the City of Pinole is intended to obtain funds
for capital projects necessary to maintain service within the WCCTAC area.
Accordingly, this fee, as it relates to development within the City of
Pinole, is not a "project" within the meaning of the California Environmental
Quality Act. (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(b)(8)(D)).



   H.   The Record establishes and finds:



      1.   That there is a reasonable relationship between the use
of the STMP fee set forth in this ordinance (funding for transportation
capital infrastructure projects) and the type of development projects on
which this fee is imposed in that all development in the City of Pinole —
both residential and non-residential — will contribute to the need for the
projects listed in Section 3.22.040 of this ordinance; and



      2.   That there is a reasonable relationship between the need
for the projects listed in Section V of this ordinance and the type of
development projects on which this fee is imposed in that new development in
the City of Pinole — both residential and non-residential — will generate
persons who live, work, shop, travel to and from, commute to and from, and
visit the City of Pinole and who, therefore, contribute to the need for the
projects listed in Section 3.22.040 of this ordinance; and



      3.   That there is a reasonable relationship between the
amount of the fee set forth in this ordinance and the cost of the projects
listed in Section 3.22.040 of this ordinance or portion of such projects
attributable to the development on which this fee is imposed in that such fee
is calculated based on projections described in the 2019 STMP Nexus Update of
new development, the total cost of the projects listed in Section 3.22.040,
and allocation of a fair share of costs to new development across the various
land use types. 



(Ord. 2019-01 § 1 (part), 2019)



3.22.030  FEES.



   A.   Levy of the Fee and Fee Structure. In order to fund the program
and projects stated herein, the following updated STMP fee schedule shall be

   B.   City of Pinole is responsible for determining the appropriate
land use category and fee amount to apply to specific development projects
being considered by their jurisdiction. Agency will refer to the STMP
Administrative Guidelines for guidance on how to apply these land use
categories to development projects.



   C.   No development shall be exempt from the fee, except if
application of the fee to the development would be unlawful under and/or
conflict with federal, state, or local law and/or regulation.  In addition,
accessory dwelling units within the footprint of an existing dwelling unit's
habitable space are not required to pay the STMP Fee.



   D.   A project that reconstructs or re-uses an existing structure or
development that has been occupied within the previous three years is subject
to the fee only to the extent that it would generate more A.M. peak hour
vehicle trips than the existing development.



   E.   Fees for uses not identified in Section 3.22.030(A) shall be
determined by the City of Pinole using the "Other" land use type and
according to methodology provided by WCCTAC in the STMP Master Cooperative
Agreement and the STMP Administrative Guidelines.  The STMP Administrative
Guidelines are incorporated into the STMP Master Cooperative Agreement and
provided for reference as Exhibit B, and may be changed from time to time by
the WCCTAC Executive Director. The current version of the STMP Administrative
Guidelines is available from WCCTAC or the City of Pinole City Clerk.



   F.   An applicant may receive credit against fees for the dedication
of land for right-of-way and/or construction of improvements for specific
2019 STMP projects, where such right-of-way or construction is beyond that
which would otherwise be required for approval of the proposed development. 
The calculation of the amount of credit against fees for 2019 STMP
dedications or improvements shall be based upon a determination by City of
Pinole that such credits are, in fact, exclusive of the dedications,
setbacks, improvements, and/or traffic mitigation measures which are required
by local ordinance, standards, or other practice.  In addition, the credit
shall be calculated based upon the actual cost of construction of
improvements or, in the case of land dedication, on an independent appraisal
approved by the City of Pinole.  City of Pinole must report any credit to
WCCTAC prior to awarding the credit.



   An applicant may receive reimbursement from STMP fees paid by other
development projects to the extent that the amount of the credit is greater
than the STMP fee obligation of the development project.  The award of any
reimbursement by City of Pinole must be preapproved by the WCCTAC Board; in
making that decision, the Board will take into consideration criteria and
metrics related to funding availability and project prioritization that they
use in making other STMP funding decisions.



   G.   The fees specified herein shall be made a condition of approval
of all tentative and final subdivision maps. The fees shall be collected at
the time of the issuance of any building permit.



   H.   The STMP fees specified above shall be collected for projects
in the entire City of Pinole.



   I.   Fees paid pursuant to this ordinance shall be deposited in a
separate segregated interest- bearing account, and together with any interest
accumulated on amounts on deposit, shall be remitted on a quarterly basis
along with the required Quarterly Report to WCCTAC or its designee, to be
placed in a fund to be used solely for the purposes described in this
ordinance and in the Master Cooperative Agreement. Any interest accumulated
on such funds shall also be used only for the purposes specified in this
ordinance.



   J.   The fees will be used for, but are not limited to, the
administration of the STMP, planning, environmental documentation, design,
acquisition of right-of-way, and construction of the projects.



   K.   Effective July 1, 2020 and on each subsequent anniversary date
of such date, the amount of each of the developer fees, set forth in Section
3.22.030(A) above, shall increase or decrease by the annual percentage change
in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco
Bay Area for the for the twelve month period ending with the February index
of the same calendar year.  The percentage change will be calculated by
WCCTAC, which will notify all signatories to the Cooperative Agreement of the
change.



   L.   Pursuant to Government Code section 66001(d), after the fifth
fiscal year following the first deposit of 2019 STMP revenues and every five
(5) years thereafter, WCCTAC shall make all required findings with respect to
that portion of the fee account or fund remaining unexpended, whether
committed or uncommitted. Such findings shall be made in connection with the
release of public information required by Government Code section 66006(b).



   M.   Pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, as specified, WCCTAC
shall submit a public report to the WCCTAC Board on an annual basis,
identifying the amount of fee revenues collected and other statutorily
required information, which will also be shared with Agencies' City
Managers/County Administrator.



   N.   An applicant may appeal the determination of the amount of the
STMP fee due, and such appeal shall be made in writing to WCCTAC with
supporting documentation.  The WCCTAC Board shall consider the appeal at a
regularly scheduled meeting, and shall make a decision on the appeal. The
decision of the WCCTAC Board is final.

3.24.010  DEFINITIONS.



   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in
this section shall govern the construction of this chapter:



   A.   HOTEL.  Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which
is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or
house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse,
dormitory, public or private club or other similar structure or portion
thereof.



   B.   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.



   C.   OPERATOR. The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,
or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions
through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the
managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this
chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her
principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.



   D.   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or
any other group or combination acting as a unit.



   E.   RENT.  The consideration charged, whether or not received, for
the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in
money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and
property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.



   F.   TAX ADMINISTRATOR.  The financial director of the city.



   G.   TRANSIENT.  Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled
to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or
other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less,
counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying
space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty
days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator
and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining
whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both
prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter may be considered. (Ord. 489 § 1, 1986).



3.24.020  TAX IMPOSED.



   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject
to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by
the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The
transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent
is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the
tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax
due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord.
543 § 2, 1991).



3.24.030  EXEMPTIONS.



   A.   No tax shall be imposed upon:



      1.   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it
is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter;



      2.   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is
exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.



   B.   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made
at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form
prescribed by the tax administrator. (Ord. 489 § 3, 1986).



3.24.040  OPERATOR'S DUTIES.



   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient.
The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent
charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be

is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall
register said hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him or her a
transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator
for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any
lawful business in any unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without
strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited
to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office
of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. (Ord. 489 § 5,
1986).



3.24.060  REPORTING AND REMITTING.



   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to
the tax administrator, on forms provided by him or her, of the total units
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient
occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator
may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or
she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she
may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by
operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of
the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. (Ord. 489 §
6, 1986).



3.24.070  PENALTIES AND INTEREST. 



   A.   Original Delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax
imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten
percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.



   B.   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any
delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date
on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second
delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to
the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed.



   C.   Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment
of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of
twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.



   D.   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator

first become delinquent until paid.



   E.   Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such
interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part
of the tax required to be paid in this chapter. (Ord. 489 § 7, 1986).



3.24.080  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX-DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.



   If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said
tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator
shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as
the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he or she is
able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties
provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax
administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to th operator so assessed at his or her last known place of
address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of
such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive
and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax
administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the
manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and
place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be
fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may
appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties
should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter given written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in Section 3.24.090. (Ord. 489 § 8, 1986).



3.24.090  APPEAL.



   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with
respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within
fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The
Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City
Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known
place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive
and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in Section
3.24.080 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall
be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 489 § 9,
1986).

   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of
and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the
right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 489 § 10, 1986).



3.24.110  REFUNDS.



   A.   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been
overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the city under this



chapter it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this
section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of
perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with
the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim
shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.



   B.   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or
erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax
has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so
collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.



   C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax
administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator
establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient
has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.



   D.   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section
unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records
showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 489 § 11, 1986).



3.24.120  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.



   Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owned by the transient to the city. Any
such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall
be deemed a debt owned by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to
the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 489
§12, 1986).



3.24.130  VIOLATION – PENALTY.



   A.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of an infraction and shall be punishable as set forth in
Section 1.12.010 of this code.



   B.   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register
as required in this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or
who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required
by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or
claim, is guilty of an infraction, and is punishable as provided in
subsection A of this section. Any person required to make, render, sign or
verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim
with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required
by this chapter to be made, is guilty of an infraction and is punishable as
provided in subsection A of this section.  (Ord. 489 § 13, 1986).

equivalent charge the service user would have incurred if the energy used had
been provided by the electrical corporation or franchised by the city. Rate
schedules for this purpose shall be available from the city. Non-utility
suppliers shall install, maintain and use an appropriate utility-type

and pipes; (2) charges made for gas used and consumed by a public utility or
governmental agency in the conduct of its business; or (3) charges made by a

utility business; and (4) charges made for gas used in the propulsion of a
motor vehicle, as authorized in the Vehicle Code of the state of California.



   C.   The tax imposed in this section shall be collected from the
service user by the person selling or transporting the gas. A person selling
only transportation services to a user for delivery of gas through mains or
pipes shall collect the tax from the service user based on the transportation
charges. The person selling or transporting the gas shall, on or before the
twentieth of each calendar month, commencing on the twentieth day of the
calendar month after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this

approved by the tax administrator. The tax imposed in this section on use
supplied by self-production or a non-utility supplier not subject to the
jurisdiction of this chapter shall be collected and remitted to the tax
administrator in the manner set forth in Section 3.26.070. (Ord. 98-104, Exh.

user receiving gas or electricity directly from a non-utility supplier not
under the jurisdiction of this chapter, or otherwise not having the full tax
due on the use of gas or electricity in the city directly billed and
collected by the service supplier, shall report said fact to the tax
administrator within thirty days of said use and shall directly remit to the
city the amount of tax due.



   B.   The tax administrator may require said service user to provide,
subject to audit, filed tax returns or other satisfactory evidence
documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used and the price thereof.

   Taxes collected from a service user which are not remitted to the tax
administrator on or before the due dates provided in this chapter are
delinquent. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the
return may be postmarked on the first regular working day following a
Saturday/Sunday or legal holiday. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).



3.26.090  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.



   Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any
such tax collected from a service user which has willfully been withheld from
the tax administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person
required to collect and remit. Any person owing money to the city under the
provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name
of the city for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part),
1998).



3.26.100  DUTY TO COLLECT – PROCEDURES.



   The duty to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this chapter shall
be performed as follows:



   A.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.26.070, the tax
shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as and along with
the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practices of the
service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service
supplier is less than the full amount of the service charge and tax which has
accrued for the billing period, such amount and any subsequent payments by a
service user shall be applied to the utility charges first until such charge
has been fully satisfied. Any remaining balance shall be applied to taxes
due. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of
his or her refusal to pay the tax imposed on said energy charges Section
3.26.110(C) will apply.



   B.   The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with
the beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the
service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are
subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a person receives more than
one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty
to collect shall arise separately for each billing. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A
§2(part), 1998)



3.26.110  ADDITIONAL POWER AND DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.



   A.   The tax administrator shall have the power and duty, and is
directed to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.



   B.   The tax administrator shall have the power to adopt rules and
regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance
of the taxes imposed in this chapter. A copy of such rules and regulations
shall be on file in the tax administrator's office.



   C.   The tax administrator may make administrative agreements to
vary the strict requirements of this chapter so that the collection of any
tax imposed here may be made in conformance with the billing procedures of a
particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in collection
of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter.
A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the tax administrator's
office.



   D.   The tax administrator shall determine the eligibility of any
person who asserts a right to exemption from the tax imposed by this chapter.
The tax administrator shall provide the service supplier with the name of any
person who the tax administrator determines is exempt from the tax imposed by
this chapter, together with the address and account number to which service
is supplied to any such exempt person. The tax administrator shall notify the
service supplier of termination of any person's right to exemption under this
chapter, or the change of any address to which service is supplied to any
exempt person.



   E.   The tax administrator shall provide notice to all service
suppliers, at least ninety days prior to any annexation or other change in
the city's boundaries. Said notice shall set forth the revised boundaries by
street and address, along with a copy of the final annexation order from
LAFCO. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).



3.26.120  ASSESSMENT – SERVICE USER ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY.



   A.   Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user
has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him or her from the
amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or that a services
user has refused to pay the amount of the tax, such person may be relieved of
the obligation to collect taxes due under this chapter from certain named
service users for specified billing periods as set forth below.



   B.   The service supplier shall provide the city with amounts
refused and/or unpaid along with the names and addresses of the service users
neglecting to pay the tax imposed under provisions of this chapter. Whenever
the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax for a period of two or
more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the
obligation to collect taxes due.



   C.   The tax administrator shall notify the service user that the
tax administrator assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the
stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served
on the service user by handing it to him or her personally or by deposit of
the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to
the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person
required to collect the tax; or, should the service user's address change, to
the last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the tax
administrator within fifteen days from the date of the service of the notice
upon him or her, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not
accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the
tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than five dollars.
The penalty shall become part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord.
98-104, Exh. A § 2 (part), 1998).



3.26.130  RECORDS.



   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and remit to
the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period
of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of
such tax as he or she may have been liable for the remittance to the tax
administrator which records the tax administrator shall have the right to
inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).



3.26.140  REFUNDS.



   A.   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more
than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the
tax administrator under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in this
section.



   B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section,
a service supplier may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes
remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established that the service user
from whom the tax has been collected did not owe the tax; provided, however,
that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the
tax erroneously or illegally collected has either been refunded to the
service user or credited to charges subsequently payable by the service user
to the person required to collect and remit. A service supplier that has
collected any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this
chapter and actually due from a service user, may refund such amount to the
service user and claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax
which is due upon any other monthly returns, provided such credit is claimed
in a return dated no later than three years from the date of overpayment.



   C.   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a
service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities
Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction makes a refund to service
users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this
chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to
service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit
for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next
monthly returns. In the event this chapter is repealed, the amounts of any
refundable taxes will be borne by the city.



   D.   A service supplier may refund the taxes collected to the
service user in accordance with this section or by the service supplier's
customary practice. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).



3.26.150  EXEMPTIONS AND REBATE OF TAX.



   Exemptions from the tax provided in this chapter may be given as
provided below:



   A.   To qualify for an exemption, persons must receive one or more
of the following:



      1.   Aid to families with dependent children (AFDC);



      2.   Veterans' and survivor's pension benefits;



      3.   Supplemental security income/state supplemental payment
(SSI/SSP);



      4.   Food stamps;



   B.   In addition, customers may also qualify for an exemption if
their total household income does not exceed household income levels set by
resolution of the City Council .



   C.   Procedures for Obtaining an Exemption.



      1.   Applications for exemption shall be filed with the tax
administrator on such forms as he or she may provide. Applications shall be
verified by declaration under penalty of perjury and shall contain such
information as may be required by the tax administrator. The service provider
shall include information in the service user's bill upon initiation of the
tax, and for all new service users thereafter, describing the procedure and
criteria for filing applications for exemption.



      2.   The tax administrator shall review each application and
shall certify the service user as exempt if the eligibility requirements of
subsection A or B are met, provided that no exemption shall be granted to a
service user who is receiving service from a service supplier through a
master meter and no exemption shall be granted with respect to any tax
imposed by this chapter which is or has been paid by a public agency or where
the service user receives funds from a public agency specifically for the
payment of such tax. If a service user is certified as exempt, the tax
administrator shall promptly notify the service user's service suppliers,
stating the name of the service user, the address to which such exempt
service is being supplied, the account number, if any, and such other
information as may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt
service user from its tax billing procedure. Upon receipt of such notice, the
service supplier shall within sixty days discontinue billing the service user
for taxes imposed by this chapter except as otherwise provided in subdivision
5 of this subsection.



      3.   Taxes billed by the service supplier to the service user
prior to removing the service user from its tax billing procedure shall be
collected from the service user and the service user shall pay such taxes to
the service supplier. Taxes billed to and paid by the service user between
the time that the application for exemption is filed and the service supplier
removes the service user from its taxing procedure will not be refunded to
the service user.



      4.   Exemptions certified by the tax administrator shall
remain in effect so long as the facts supporting the qualification for
exemption shall exist. An exemption shall automatically terminate with any
change in the service address or residence of the exempt



individual, provided that such individual may nevertheless apply for a new
exemption with each change of address of residence.



      5.   Any service user who has been exempted under this
subsection shall notify the tax administrator within ten days of any change
in fact or circumstance which might disqualify said individual from receiving
such exemption. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive
the benefits of the exemption provided by this section when the basis for
such exemption does not exist or ceases to exist.



         Any service supplier, who determines by any means that a
new or non-exempt service user is receiving service through a meter or
connection exempt by virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or
exempt user of the same meter or connection, shall immediately notify the tax
administrator of such fact and the tax administrator shall conduct an
investigation to ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section have
been complied with, and where appropriate, order the service supplier to
commence collecting the tax from the non-exempt service user.



      6.   The tax administrator shall have the power and right to
demand evidence of continued eligibility of a service user for exemption
under the provisions of this section. Such evidence may include, but need not
be limited to, copies of business records, letters or statements from the
Social Security Administration and state, county, city and private pension
administrators or unemployment and welfare agencies, and such other evidence
concerning the service user or other members of his or her household as may
tend to prove or disprove such eligibility. Failure to provide such evidence
as is within the control of a service user to so provide, either directly by
him or her or by his or her consent or the consent of a member of his or her
household when such evidence is requested of the service user in writing by
the tax administrator shall be grounds for immediate discontinuance of the
service user's eligibility for exemption under the provisions of this
section. Evidence provided to the tax administrator at his or her request, or
voluntarily provided to him or her by the service user without the tax
administrator's request, may not be used against such service user as
evidence of violation of the provisions of this section. Such evidence may
only be used as grounds for termination of the exemption provided in this
section.



   D.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax
upon any person when imposition of such a tax upon that person would be in
violation of the Constitution of the United States or that of the state of
California.   (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).



3.26.160  TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF UTILITY USERS TAX.



   The service supplier shall, upon notification, terminate or suspend any
utility users tax commencing with the first full billing period which occurs
after the effective date of such action by the City Council . (Ord. 98-104,
Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).



3.26.170  REVIEW.



   Commencing in June 1999, and in June of every year thereafter, as part
of the budget process, the provisions of this chapter shall be reviewed and a
separate report made to the Council. The report shall contain a summary of
the amounts realized, the necessity of the tax and the adequacy of the tax
rate. A public hearing shall be held on the report and the Council shall
determine whether or not changes to the household income levels for utility
user tax exemption or to the classes of exemptions of persons or service
should be made by resolution of the City Council . A measure shall be placed
on the ballot by the City Council for voter approval to enact any other
changes in the tax and/or its method of collection. (Ord. 98-104, Exh. A §
2(part), 1998).



3.26.180  REPEAL OF CHAPTER.



   This chapter shall automatically be repealed on December 31, 2020,
unless amended pursuant to Section 3.26.170. (Ord. 2012-08 § 2, 2012; Ord.
2005-15 § 1, 2004; Ord. 98-104, Exh. A § 2(part), 1998).

   This chapter shall be known as the City of Pinole Transactions and Use
Tax Ordinance.  The city hereinafter shall be called "city."  This chapter
shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the city.  (Ord.
2006-07 § 2, 2006)



3.28.020  OPERATIVE DATE.



   OPERATIVE DATE means the first day of the first calendar quarter
commencing more than one hundred and ten (110) days after the adoption of

3.28.030  PURPOSE.



   This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes,
and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish
those purposes:



   A.   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with
the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2
which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be
operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve
the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.



   B.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that
incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of
the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with
the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code.



   C.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that
imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and
collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself
as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from,
the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State
Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State
Sales and Use Taxes.



   D.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can
be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use
taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.  (Ord.
2006-07 § 2, 2006)



3.28.040  CONTRACT WITH STATE.



   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State
Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration
and operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided, that if
the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior
to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case
the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such a contract.  (Ord. 2006-07 § 2, 2006)



3.28.050  TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE. 



   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a
tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate of one-half
of one percent (0.005%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale
of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and
after the operative date of this chapter.  (Ord. 2006-07 § 2, 2006)



3.28.060  PLACE OF SALE. 



   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at
the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property
sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination
or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination.  The
gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such
charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place
to which delivery is made.  In the event a retailer has no permanent place
of business in the state or has more than one (1) place of business, the
place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined
under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board
of Equalization. (Ord. 2006-07 § 2, 2006)



3.28.070  USE TAX RATE.



   An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the city of tangible personal property purchased from any
retailer on and after the operative date of this ordinance for storage, use
or other consumption in said territory at the rate of one-half of one percent
(0.005%) of the sales price of the property.  The sales price shall include
delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax
regardless of the place to which delivery is made.    (Ord. 2006-07 § 2,
2006)



3.28.080  ADOPTION OF PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW.



   Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance and except insofar as
they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with
Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby
adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein. 
(Ord. 2006-07 § 2, 2006)



3.28.090  LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW AND COLLECTION OF USE TAXES.

Taxation Code:

State Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of
Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California;



      2.   The result of that substitution would require action to
be taken by or against this city or any agency, officer, or employee thereof
rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the
functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.



      3.   In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited
to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the
result of the substitution would be to:



         a.   Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales,
storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under
the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or;



         b.   Impose this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would
not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision of that code.



      4.   In Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence
thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.



   B.   The word CITY shall be substituted for the word STATE in the
phrase "retailer engaged in business in this State" in Section 6203 and in
the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.  (Ord. 2006-07 § 2, 2006)

be required by this chapter.  (Ord. 2006-07 § 2, 2006)

section, the sale or lease of tangible personal property shall be deemed not
to be obligated pursuant to a contract or lease for any period of time for
which any party to the contract or lease has the unconditional right to
terminate the contract or lease upon notice, whether or not such right is
exercised.



   C.   There are exempted from the use tax imposed by this ordinance,
the storage, use or other consumption in this city of tangible personal
property:

   This chapter shall be known as the City of Pinole Transactions and Use
Tax Ordinance.  The City of Pinole hereinafter shall be called "city." 
This chapter shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the city. 
(Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.020  OPERATIVE DATE.



   OPERATIVE DATE means the first day of the first calendar quarter

§ 2, 2014)



3.30.030  PURPOSE.



   This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes,
and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish
those purposes:



   A.   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with
the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2
which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be
operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve
the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.



   B.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that
incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of
the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with
the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code.



   C.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that
imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and
collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself
as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from,
the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State
Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State
Sales and Use Taxes.



   D.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can
be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use
taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.  (Ord.
2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.040  CONTRACT WITH STATE.



   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State
Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration
and operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided, that if
the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior
to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case
the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such a contract.  (Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.050  TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE.



   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a
tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate of one-half
of one percent (0.50%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of
all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after
the operative date of this chapter.  (Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.060  PLACE OF SALE.



   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at
the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property
sold is delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state
destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state
destination.  The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax,
regardless of the place to which delivery is made.  In the event a retailer
has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one (1)
place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are
consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed
and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.  (Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.070  USE TAX RATE.



   An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in the city of tangible personal property purchased from any
retailer on and after the operative date of this chapter for storage, use or
other consumption in said territory at the rate of one-half of one percent
(0.50%) of the sales price of the property.  The sales price shall include
delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax
regardless of the place to which delivery is made.  (Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.080.  ADOPTION OF PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW.



   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except insofar as they
are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section
6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and
made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein.  (Ord. 2014-03
§ 2, 2014)



3.30.090  LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW AND COLLECTION OF USE TAXES.



   In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code:



   A.   Wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the
taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor. 
However, the substitution shall not be made when:



      1.   The word “State” is used as a part of the title of
the State Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of
Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California;



      2.   The result of that substitution would require action to
be taken by or against this city or any agency, officer, or employee thereof
rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the
functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.



      3.   In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited
to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California,
where the result of the substitution would be to:



         a.   Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales,
storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under
the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; or



         b.   Impose this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would
not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision of that code.



      4.   In Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence
thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.



   B.   The word "city" shall be substituted for the word "state" in
the phrase "retailer engaged in business in this State" in Section 6203 and
in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.  (Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.100  PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.



   If a seller's permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067
of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional transactor's permit shall not
be required by this chapter.  (Ord. 2014-03 § 2, 2014)



3.30.110  EXEMPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.



   A.   There shall be excluded from the measure of the transactions
tax and the use tax the amount of any sales tax or use tax imposed by the

the purposes of this division, delivery to a point outside the city shall be
satisfied:



         a.   With respect to vehicles (other than commercial
vehicles) subject to registration pursuant to Chapter 1 (commencing with
Section 4000) of Division 3 of the Vehicle Code, aircraft licensed in

declaration under penalty of perjury, signed by the buyer, stating that such
address is, in fact, his or her principal place of residence; and

      5.   For the purposes of divisions (3) and (4) of this
section, the sale or lease of tangible personal property shall be deemed not
to be obligated pursuant to a contract or lease for any period of time for
which any party to the contract or lease has the unconditional right to
terminate the contract or lease upon notice, whether or not such right is
exercised.



   C.   These are exempted from the use tax imposed by this chapter,
the storage, use or other consumption in this city of tangible personal
property:



      1.   The gross receipts from the sale of which have been
subject to a transactions tax under any state-administered transactions and

operators of aircraft and used or consumed by such operators directly and
exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of persons or
property for hire or compensation under a certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued pursuant to the laws of this State, the United States,
or any foreign government.  This exemption is in addition to the exemptions
provided in Sections 6366 and 6366.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the

      5.   For the purposes of Divisions (3) and (4) of this
section, storage, use, or other consumption, or possession of, or exercise of
any right or power over, tangible personal property shall be deemed not to be
obligated pursuant to a contract or lease for any period of time for which
any party to the contract or lease has the unconditional right to terminate
the contract or lease upon notice, whether or not such right is exercised.



      6.   Except as provided in Division (7), a retailer engaged in
business in the city shall not be required to collect use tax from the
purchaser of tangible personal property, unless the retailer ships or
delivers the property into the city or participates within the city in making
the sale of the property, including, but not limited to, soliciting or
receiving the order, either directly or indirectly, at a place of business of
the retailer in the city or through any representative, agent, canvasser,
solicitor, subsidiary, or person in the city under the authority of the
retailer.



      7.   "A retailer engaged in business in the city" shall also
include any retailer of any of the following:  vehicles subject to
registration pursuant to Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 4000) of Division
3 of the Vehicle Code, aircraft licensed in compliance with Section 21411 of

   Persons required to pay a license tax for transacting and carrying on
any business under this article shall not be relieved from payment of any fee
required under any other ordinance of the city and shall remain subject to
the regulatory provisions of other ordinances. (Ord. 338 § 2, 1975).



5.04.020  LICENSE AND TAX PAYMENT REQUIRED.



   A.   There are imposed upon the businesses, trades, professions,
callings and occupations specified in this article license taxes in the
amounts prescribed in this article. It is unlawful for any person to transact
and carry on any business, trade, profession, calling, or occupation in the
city without first having procured a license from the city so to do and
paying the tax prescribed in this article or without complying with any and
all applicable provisions of this article.



   B.   This section shall not be construed to require any person to
obtain a license prior to doing business within the city if such requirement
conflicts with applicable statutes of the United States or of the state of
California. Persons not so required to obtain a license prior to doing
business within the city nevertheless shall be liable for payment of the tax
imposed by this article. (Ord. 338 § 3, 1975).



5.04.030  BRANCH ESTABLISHMENTS.



   A separate license must be obtained for each branch establishment or
location of the business transacted and carried on and for each separate type
of business at the same location, and each license shall authorize the
licensee to transact and carry. on only the business licensed thereby at the
location or in the mannerr designated in such license; provided, that
warehouses and distributing plants used in connection with and incidental to
a business licensed under the provisions of this article shall not be deemed
to be separate places of business or branch establishment; provided further,
that any person conducting two or more types of businesses under the same
management, and which businesses use a single set or integrated set of books
and records may, at his or her option, pay only one tax calculated on the
total number of employees of the business. (Ord. 338 § 4, 1975).



5.04.040  EVIDENCE OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS.



   When any person, by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone book, or
newspapers, advertises, holds out, or represents that he or she is in
business in the city, or when any person holds an active license or permit
issued by a governmental agency indicating that he or she is in business in
the city, and such person fails to deny by a sworn statement given to the
license administrator that he or she is not conducting a business in the city
after being requested to do so by the license administrator, then these facts
shall be considered prima facie evidence that he or she is conducting a
business in the city. (Ord. 338 § 5, 1975).



5.04.050  CONSTITUTIONAL APPORTIONMENT.



   A.   None of the license taxes provided for by this article shall be
so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be
violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution
of the United States and the state of California.



   B.   In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or
applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or
be violative of such constitutional clauses, he or she may apply to the
license administrator for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be
made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license
tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show
such information as the license administrator may deem necessary in order to
determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The license
administrator shall then conduct an investigation and, after having first
obtained the approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the license tax for
the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the
license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over
and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged,
the license administrator shall have the power to base the license tax based
on the number of employees or any other measure which will assure that the
license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of
like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax
as prescribed by this article. (Ord. 338 § 6, 1975).



5.04.060  CONTENTS OF LICENSE.

payment of the prescribed license tax, the license administrator shall issue

   B.   Whenever the tax imposed under the provisions of this article
is measured by the number of vehicles, devices, machines, or other pieces of
equipment used or whenever the license tax is measured by the gross receipts
from the operation of such items, the license administrator shall issue only
one license; provided, that he or she may issue for each tax period for which
the license tax has been paid one identification sticker, tag, plate, or
symbol for each item excluded in the measure of the tax or used in a business
where the tax is measured by the gross receipts from such items. (Ord. 338 §
8, 1975).

is measured by the number of employees, the application shall set forth such
information as may be therein required and as may be necessary to determine
the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant;



      6.   Any further information which the license administrator
may require to enable him or her to issue the type of license applied for.



   B.   If the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant is
measured by the number of employees, he or she shall estimate the number of
employees for the period to be covered by the license to be issued. Such
estimate, if accepted by the license administrator as reasonable, shall be
used in determining the amount of license tax to be paid by the applicant.
(Ord. 338 § 9, 1975).

5.04.090 STATEMENTS AND RECORDS.



   No statements shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein,
nor shall the filing of the same preclude the city from collecting by
appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable under this
article. Such statement and each of the several items therein contained shall
be subject to audit and verification by the license administrator, his or her
deputies, or authorized employees of the city who are authorized by this
section to examine, audit, and inspect such books and records of any licensee
or applicant for license as may be necessary in their judgment to verify or

   A.   The license administrator is not required to send a renewal
notice or bill to any person subject to the provisions of this article, and
failure to send notice or bill shall not affect the validity of any license
fee due under this article.



   B.   If any person fails to file any required statement within the
time prescribed, or if after demand therefor made by the license
administrator he or she fails to file a corrected statement, or if any person

license administrator may determine the amount of license tax due from such
persons by means of such information as he or she may be able to obtain.



   C.   If the license administrator is not satisfied with the
information supplied in statements or application filed, he or she may
determine the amount of any license tax due by means of any information he or
she may be able to obtain.

depositing it in the United States Post Office at Pinole, California, postage
prepaid, addressed to the person so assessed at his or her last known

authorize the transacting and carrying on of such business under the license
at some other location to which the business is or is to be moved; provided
further, that transfer, whether by sale or otherwise, to another person under
such circumstances that the real or ultimate ownership after the transfer is

be prohibited by this article. For the purpose of this section, stockholders,
bondholders, partnerships, or other persons holding an interest in a
corporation or other entity defined in Section 5.08.090 to be a person are
regarded as having the real or ultimate ownership of such corporation or
other entity. (Ord. 338 § 16, 1975).



5.04.150  DUPLICATE LICENSE.



   A duplicate license may be issued by the license administrator to
replace any license previously issued under this article which has been lost

conducts business within the city, whichever is applicable. All licenses
issued under this article shall be effective on a calendar-year basis of

   B.   No license shall be issued, nor one which has been suspended or
revoked shall be reinstated or reissued, to any person who, at the time of
applying therefor, is indebted to the city for any delinquent license taxes,
unless such person, with the consent of the license administrator, enters
into a written agreement with the city through the license administrator to
pay such delinquent taxes in monthly installments or more often extending
over a period of not to exceed one year.



   C.   In an agreement so entered into, such person shall acknowledge
the obligation owed to the city and agree that in the event of failure to
make timely payment of any installment, the whole amount unpaid shall become
immediately due and payable and that his or her current license shall be
revocable by the license administrator upon thirty days' notice. In the event
legal action is brought by the city to enforce collection of any amount
included in the agreement, such person shall pay all costs of suit incurred
by the city or its assignee, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The
execution of such an agreement shall not prevent the prior accrual of
penalties on unpaid balances at the rate provided in subsection A of this
section, but no penalties shall accrue on account of taxes included in the
agreement after the execution of the agreement and the payment of the first
installment and during such time as such person shall not be in breach of the
agreement. (Ord. 338 § 20, 1975).



5.04.190  REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.

license administrator within a period of three years from the last day of the
calendar month following the period for which the overpayment was made, and
all such claims for refund of the amount of the overpayment must be filed
with the license administrator on forms furnished by him or her and in the
manner prescribed by him or her. Upon the filing of such a claim and when he
or she determines that an overpayment has been made, the license
administrator may refund the amount overpaid. (Ord. 338 § 21, 1975).

   The City Council finds that it is in the best public interest that a
procedure be established for the purpose of providing the police department
with a reasonable, fair and expeditious means to select tow truck service for
moving damaged and disabled vehicles from the streets and highways of the
city and for removing abandoned vehicles, illegally parked vehicles and those
vehicles that must be moved for safekeeping. (Ord. 531 § 2(part), 1990).



5.56.020  ESTABLISHMENT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS.

city. Such rules and regulations shall include, but not be limited to, hours
of availability; compliance with all local, state and federal statutes;

truck service application to determine that there is compliance with local
rules and regulations, state and federal statutes. The chief of police shall

status of each application. If the applicant is not certified to be placed
on, or is removed from, the city rotation tow list, a written appeal to such
action can be made to the City Manager within ten days from the date of
notice of denial of the application or removal from the city rotation tow
list. (Ord. 531 § 2(part), 1990).



5.56.050  UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY AND GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION.

been committed by a tow truck service, its agents, officers or employees,
such acts or practices shall be sufficient grounds for removal from such city
rotation tow list. (Ord. 531 § 2 (part), 1990).

to protect the safety and welfare of the general public.



   B.   The City Council finds that marijuana dispensaries and
commercial marijuana cultivation are public nuisances in that many violent
crimes have been committed that can be traced back to the proliferation of
marijuana dispensaries, including armed robberies and murders. Increased
noise and pedestrian traffic, including nonresidents in pursuit of marijuana,
and out-of-area criminals in search of prey, are commonly encountered near or
outside marijuana dispensaries or commercial marijuana cultivation operations.



   C.   Therefore, in order to protect the integrity of the city, the
City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the residents of the
city to prohibit marijuana dispensaries and commercial marijuana cultivation.



   D.   The purpose of this chapter is to prohibit medical marijuana
dispensaries and commercial marijuana cultivation activities from being

otherwise prohibited by any state or federal law.

litter in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, stormwater system, creek,
fountain, pool, lake, stream, river or any other body of water, business
place, or upon any public or private plot of land in the city so that the
same might become a pollutant, except in containers or in lawfully
established waste disposal facilities.



      The occupant or tenant, or in the absence of occupant or tenant,
the owner or proprietor of any real property in the City in front of which
there is a paved sidewalk shall maintain said sidewalk free of dirt or litter
to the maximum extent practicable. Sweepings from the sidewalk shall not be
swept or otherwise made or allowed to go into the gutter or roadway, but
shall be disposed of in receptacles maintained as required for the disposal
of solid waste.



   B.   Bodies of Water.  No person shall throw or deposit litter in
any fountain, pool, lake, creek, stream, river or any other body of water in
a park or elsewhere within the City.

premises shall further implement best management practices to minimize the
release of litter, trash, or other refuse.



   D.   Standard for Parking Lots, Paved Areas and Related Stormwater
Systems. Persons owning, operating or maintaining a paved parking lot, the
paved areas of a gas station, a paved private street or road and related
stormwater systems shall clean those premises as frequently and thoroughly as
practicable in a manner that does not result in the discharge of pollutants
to the stormwater system. Persons owning, operating or maintaining such
premises shall install and maintain a Full Trash Capture System, and any
other devices or facilities specified by the Director, on all inlets to the
City’s stormwater system no later than January 1, 2019, to prevent the
discharge of trash or other pollutants to the City’s stormwater system from
private parking lots, streets, roads, and drainage facilities into the
stormwater system. Failure or refusal to timely comply with such requirement
is prohibited and shall constitute a violation of this chapter, except that
the Director may waive this requirement or extend the deadline for compliance
for any premises for which the Director determines, in his or her sole
judgment, that installation of a Full Trash Capture System is not feasible or
necessary to prevent discharge of pollutants.



   E.   Best Management Practices for New Developments and
Redevelopments. All construction contractors performing work in the City
shall conform to the requirements of the Best Management Practices (BMPs) for
Construction Activities and New Development and Redevelopment required by the
California BMP Handbook, Construction, January 2003, the Caltrans Stormwater
Quality Handbooks, Construction Site Best Management Practices Manual, March
2003, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board Erosion and
Sediment Control Field Manual, 2002, the City's grading and erosion control
ordinance and other generally accepted engineering practices for erosion
control as required by the director when undertaking construction
activities.  As a minimum, such BMPs shall include provision for filter
materials placed to preclude an increase in debris and sediments entering the
stormwater system over “non project” conditions. The City Engineer may
establish controls on the rate, volume, and duration of stormwater runoff
from construction projects as may be appropriate to minimize the discharge
and transport of pollutants. All construction sites must implement and
maintain at least the following minimum BMPs: erosion control at the site,
run-on and run-off controls to and from the site, control of sediments and
fines on the site, active treatment systems (as necessary), good site
management, and non-stormwater management.



   F.   Notification of Intent and Compliance with General Permits.
Each industrial discharger, discharger associated with construction activity
or other discharge described in any general stormwater permit addressing such
discharges, as may be adopted by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, or the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region, shall provide the
notice of intent, comply with and undertake all other activities required by
any general stormwater permit applicable to such dischargers. Each discharger
identified in an individual NPDES permit relating to stormwater discharges
shall comply with and undertake all activities required by such permit.



   G.   Development Runoff Requirements.  For each new development and
redevelopment project subject to the development runoff requirements, every
applicant will submit a stormwater control plan and implement conditions of
approval that reduce stormwater pollutant discharges through the
construction, operation and maintenance of treatment measures and other
appropriate source control and site design measures.  Similarly, increases
in runoff volume and flows shall be managed in accordance with the
development runoff requirements.



   H.   Compliance with Best Management Practices. Where best
management practice guidelines or requirements have been adopted by any
federal, state, regional, City and/or county agency, for any activity,
operation or facility which may cause or contribute to non-stormwater

require any business in the city that is engaged in activities which may
result in non-stormwater discharges or runoff pollutants to develop and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, which must include an
employee training program. Business activities which may require a stormwater
pollution prevention plan include maintenance, storage, manufacturing,
assembly, equipment operations, vehicle loading, fueling, vehicle
maintenance, food handling or processing, or cleanup procedures which are
carried out partially or wholly out of doors.

8.20.100  COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.



   A.   Every person who owns, leases or operates any premises
containing a stormwater management facility or facilities is required to
obtain annually a valid operation and maintenance certificate of compliance
certifying to the inspection of and the proper operation and maintenance of
the treatment measures and other appropriate source control and site design
measures.  Each responsible person subject to this requirement shall request
an inspection from the City every 12 months.  Upon the filing of such
request, and the payment of a fee covering the cost of inspection, the City
shall inspect the property and shall either issue such certificate upon a
determination by the inspector that all treatment measures and other
appropriate source control and site design measures have been properly
maintained and are in good condition, or shall issue a conditional
certificate noting deficiencies that must be corrected within a time
indicated on the certificate, or shall deny the certificate.  A certificate
shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance.  The City Council may
by resolution establish the fee for the inspection and certificate.



   B.   In lieu of a City inspection, such person may arrange for an
inspection from a private company authorized to conduct inspections by the

that the treatment measures and other appropriate source control and site
design measures have been properly maintained and are in good condition, the
City may issue an operation and maintenance certificate of compliance or the
City may at its cost re-inspect the property and proceed as described in
division A.  The filing of a false inspection report shall be a misdemeanor.

County Fire Protection District, County Environmental Health Department, the
Contra Costa Mosquito and Vector Control District, or the Regional Water
Quality Control Board.

responsible for emergency response for a facility have a responsibility to
train facility personnel and maintain notification procedures to assure
immediate notification is provided to the City of any suspected, confirmed or
unconfirmed release of material, pollutants or waste creating a risk of
non-stormwater discharge into the City stormwater system.

confirmed or unconfirmed release of non-stormwater discharge entering the
city stormwater system, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure
the discovery and containment and cleanup such release and shall notify the
city of the occurrences by telephoning the city engineer. This notification
requirement is in addition to and not in lieu of other required notifications.

Officer may require that any person engaged in any activity or owning or
operating any facility which may cause or contribute to non-stormwater
discharges, undertake such monitoring activities and/or analysis and furnish
such reports as the officer may specify. The burden, including costs, of

   H.   Uniform Code Violations:



      1.   The maintenance or tolerance of any building or condition
that violates the Uniform Building, Electrical, Plumbing, Mechanical, Fire,
Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, or Uniform Housing Codes as adopted by the
city, or which violate any provision of state or federal law relating to
health, safety, and/or environmental protection or any local ordinance,
resolution, approval, permit, agreement, rule or regulation. Buildings in
existence at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this
chapter may have their existing use of occupancy continued, if such use or
occupancy was legal at the time of adoption of the codes they were
constructed under, provided such continued use is not dangerous to life;



   I.   Miscellaneous:



      1.   Maintenance of night security lighting that adversely
affects the darkness within bedroom, or living room windows of a neighboring
property,



      2.   Any encroachment on a public street or rightof-way for
which no encroachment permit has been issued, any fence, wall or other
permanent structure which has been erected in violation of this code and
which encroaches upon a right-of-way,



      3.   Maintenance for a period of six months or longer of any
on-site sign, including its supporting structure or structures, which is so
disfigured or obsolete that it no longer identifies the current occupancy of
the premises upon which such sign is located or otherwise fails to serve its
intended purpose,



      4.   Maintenance of any unsafe or insecure sign or supporting
structure(s) thereof or of any sign or supporting structure which is damaged
to the point of presenting a possible safety hazard,



      5.   Any violation of any provision of the Pinole Municipal
Code,



      6.   Any violation of any provisions of residential or
commercial covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) which by their
terms are enforceable by the city,



      7.   Any other condition recognized in law or in equity as
constituting a public nuisance,



      8.   Any other condition or use of property which gives rise
to a reasonable determination that the condition or use represents some
threat to the health and welfare of the public by virtue of its unsafe,
dangerous or hazardous nature, or which is so out of harmony with the
standards of properties in the vicinity so as to cause substantial diminution
of the enjoyment, use, or property values of such properties. (Ord. 2004-10,
§ 2(part), 2004; Ord. 01-107 § 2(part), 2001).



8.24.025  UNLAWFUL PROPERTY NUISANCE — GARAGE SALES.



   A.   Findings. 



      1.   These regulations are adopted to regulate garage sales in
order to advance the substantial governmental interest in protecting the
public health, safety and welfare.  The regulations have been drafted to
directly advance that interest in the narrowest fashion.



      2.   The intent of this section is to eliminate perpetual,
prolonged and extended garage and yard sales.  Perpetual, prolonged and
extended garage sales have been found to detract from the character of the
city by congesting traffic circulation and parking, inconveniencing
neighbors, and creating aesthetic degradation through visual clutter. 
Businesses lawfully operating within the city comply with numerous city,
county, state, and federal statutes and regulations applicable to businesses;
thus, the non-regulation of perpetual, prolonged and extended garage sales
provides an unfair business advantage.



      3.   Garage sale signs have certain deleterious effects
specific to this form of commercial advertising.  Garage sale signs create
traffic safety problems by causing driver distractions.  Garage sale signs
undermine neighborhood aesthetics by creating visual clutter.  Garage sale
signs create a public nuisance that must be abated through expenditures of
public funds to remove abandoned signs.



   B.   Definitions.



      GARAGE SALE.   A yard sale, patio sale, garage sale, or any
similar sale of merchandise consisting of personal items, by an individual or
group, for profit, when the merchandise to be sold is offered to the general
public, all of which sales shall be conducted within a building and/or on
private property.



   C.   Time, place and manner restrictions.



      1.   Garage sales shall be limited to four  per calendar
year, of a duration not longer than two consecutive days, or one  garage
sale per calendar year for a duration of not more than seven days, on the
same residentially zoned parcel in any one calendar year.



      2.   Such garage sales shall not be conducted before seven
a.m. or after seven p.m.



      3.   Garage sales be conducted on private property and shall
not be permitted on public sidewalks, alleys, streets or other public
rights-of-way.



   D.   Signs. Signs advertising a garage sale may be placed or erected
at any location where otherwise legally permissible, subject to the following
conditions:



      1.   No such sign shall exceed four square feet in area;



      2.   No such sign shall be displayed more than twenty-four
hours prior to, nor more than 24 hours following, the event advertised
thereon.



      3.   All signs posted pursuant to this section shall specify
on the face of such sign the dates of the garage sale advertised.



   E.   Enforcement.



      1.   Every person who, for himself or herself or as an agent
of another, commences, engages in, conducts or carries on any garage sale in
violation of this section shall be prosecuted for an infraction for a first
offense; second and subsequent offenses within one year may be prosecuted as
an infraction or misdemeanor.



      2.   Additionally, any violation of this section shall be
declared a public nuisance. 



      3.   The penalties and remedies specified herein shall not be
exclusive but shall be cumulative with all other remedies at law or in
equity.  Additionally, the remedies of this section shall not limit the City
nor any person from seeking any other legal remedy available by law,
including but not limited to an action for private or public nuisance and any
remedy found elsewhere in this Code. (Ord. 2004-10 § 2(part), 2004)



8.24.030  UNLAWFUL PROPERTY NUISANCE – PUBLIC PROPERTY.



   It is unlawful for any person owning, leasing, renting, occupying or
having charge or possession of any private property in the city to use,
maintain or allow to be maintained such property for any purposes so as to
create any of the following conditions on adjacent or contiguous public
property, except as may be allowed by this code:



   A.   Outdoor Storage, Operations or Encroachment:



      1.   The tracking of mud, dirt, sand, gravel, and concrete
onto the street or right-of-way,



      2.   The spilling of debris, including trash, paper, wood,
plant cuttings and other vegetation, onto the street or right-of-way,



      3.   Vehicles and/or other materials associated with business
activity stored on the street or in the right-of-way;



   B.   Miscellaneous: Any other condition or use of property which
gives rise to a reasonable determination that the effect of the use or
condition on adjacent public property represents some threat to the health
and welfare of the public by virtue of its unsafe, dangerous or hazardous
nature, or which is so out of harmony with the standards of properties in the
vicinity so as to cause substantial diminution of the enjoyment, use, or
property values of such properties. (Ord. 2004-10 § 2(part), 2004; Ord.
01-107 § 2(part), 2001).



8.24.035  UNLAWFUL PROPERTY NUISANCE — VEHICLES.



   A.   Findings. 



      1.   The City Council finds that the parking and storage of
vehicles in residential areas may pose a health and safety hazard when such
vehicles reduce driver visibility, create visual clutter, undermine the
residential character of neighborhoods, and require extended drive times due
to the elimination of convenient street parking.



      2.   The City Council finds that the use of vehicles for human
habitation in the city has created, and continues to create, issues of
blight, crime, health and sanitation, including the disposal of noxious and
harmful matter on city streets and parking areas open to the public, and
similar nuisance conditions.



      3.   The regulations established by this section create
reasonable restrictions that promote the city’s compelling interest in
protecting the public safety to the extent authorized by the California
Vehicle Code.

2004; Ord. 01-107 § 2(part), 2001).

Manager shall commence proceedings to cause the abatement of such condition.



   ABATEMENT. May be accomplished by abatement proceedings, citation

   The following steps are to be followed in the abatement proceedings
process:



   A.   Step One. The City Manager shall issue a courtesy notice

      1.   If abated, the City Manager will document findings and
close the case, forwarding a letter of appreciation to the owner and/or
tenant for his/her cooperation.



      2.   If not abated, the City Manager may take either or both
of the following actions:



         a.   Commence criminal proceedings for violations of any

order (or within five days from such date if the City Manager has determined
the condition is such as to make it dangerous to the life, limb, property or

other lien or encumbrance of record; the owner or holder of any lease of
record; and the holder of any other estate or legal interest of record in or

section.

8.24.160  COST ACCOUNTING AND RECOVERY REQUIRED.



   The city shall maintain records of all administrative costs incurred by

   Pursuant to this chapter, the City Manager or his/her designee shall
keep an accurate account of the abatement costs incurred by the city,

City Manager or his/her designee shall prepare a final itemized written
report showing the total abatement costs and he/she shall submit such report
for confirmation by the City Council at its next available regular meeting. 
At least ten days prior to the date of such meeting, a copy of the report

resolution, confirm the report as submitted or modified. (Ord. 2004-10 §
2(part), 2004)



8.24.190  PAYMENT OF ABATEMENT COSTS.



   The City Manager may receive payment in full of the abatement costs
charged against a parcel of land at any time after confirmation of the report
by the City Council and prior to the levy of costs as lien or the filing of
an assessment report with the County Tax Collector. (Ord. 2004-10 § 2(part),
2004)



8.24.195  SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OR NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN.



   A.   The costs of abatement by the city as confirmed by the City
Council may be levied as a nuisance abatement lien against the subject
property pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.1.

      1.   Prior to recordation, notice shall be provided to
owner.  Service of the notice shall be in the same manner as a summons in a
civil action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 415.10 et seq.  If
the owner, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served
by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a
period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation published in Contra Costa County pursuant to Government Code
Section 6062.

      2.   The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the
County Recorder's office and shall have the force, effect and priority of a
judgment lien.

      3.   The nuisance abatement lien shall specify the amount of
the lien, the name of the city, the date of the Council's abatement order,
the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the
parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the owner.

      4.   The nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an
action brought by the City for a money judgment.

      5.   The city may recover from the owner any costs incurred
regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to
the owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.

   B.   Alternatively, the costs of abatement by the city as confirmed
by the City Council may be made a special assessment against the subject
property pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5.

      1.   Prior to making a special assessment, notice shall be
provided to the owner.  The notice shall specify that the property may be
sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent
assessments.  Service of the notice shall be made by certified mail to the
owner based on the address indicated on the assessor's roll or any other
address determined during the abatement process.  The tax collector's power
of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the owner to receive notice.

      2.   After the City Council has confirmed the report of costs
to abate the nuisance, and if such costs have not been paid in full, the City
Manager or his/her designee shall transmit a copy of the report together with
a copy of the resolution confirming the same to the County Tax Collector, who
shall add the amount of abatement costs, or unpaid portion thereof, to the
next regular tax bill as a special assessment for municipal purposes levied
against the property on which the nuisance was maintained or from which said
nuisance extended.

      3.   The assessment may be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be
collected subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in
case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.  All laws
applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall
be applicable to the special assessment.

      4.   If the property to which the cost of abatement relates
has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a
lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would
become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien
against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured
roll for collection.

      5.   The city may, subject to the requirements applicable to
the sale of property pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code section 3691,
conduct a sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment
of that assessment is delinquent.

   C.   The City Council may order refunded all or any part of a lien
or special assessment paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter if the
City Council finds that all or and part of the lien or special assessment has
been erroneously levied.  A lien or special assessment, or any part thereof,
shall not be refunded unless a claim is filed with the City Clerk.  The
claim shall be verified by the person who paid the tax or his/her guardian,
executor, administrator, personal representative or successor in interest. 
(Ord. 2004-10 § 2(part), 2004)



8.24.200  ACCRUAL OF INTEREST ON CITY LIENS AND ASSESSMENTS FINDINGS.



   The City Council finds and declares that the establishment of an
interest accrual requirement as to unpaid city liens and assessments upon
real property which are of record with the county recorder for Contra Costa
County is a necessary and appropriate exercise of the city council's police
power. (Ord. 2004-10 § 2(part), 2004; Ord. 01-107 § 2(part), 2001).



8.24.210  ACCRUAL OF INTEREST ON LIENS AND ASSESSMENTS.



   Unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation, all liens and
assessments which are imposed by the city against any real property located
in the city which are recorded on and after the effective date of this
regulation shall accrue interest at the rate of eight percent annually until
the lien or assessment, including interest thereon, is paid in full. (Ord.
2004-10 § 2(part), 2004; Ord. 01-107 § 2(part), 2001).



8.24.220  COST OF ABATEMENT A PERSONAL OBLIGATION.



   Instead of making the expenses of abating a nuisance a special
assessment against the real property under this section, or in addition
thereto, the City Council may make the expenses the personal obligation of
the property owner, tenant, or other person creating, causing, committing, or
maintaining the nuisance. In such a case, all of the procedures of this
chapter apply except those specifically related to assessment of the
property. (Ord. 2004-10 § 2(part), 2004; Ord. 01-107 § 2 (part), 2001).

   A.   Authority.  This chapter is adopted pursuant to Government
Code §§ 36901 and 53069.4.

   B.   Goals. This chapter is adopted in order to:

      1.   Protect the health, safety and welfare of the city and
its citizens;

      2.   Penalize responsible parties who fail or refuse to comply
with any city ordinance or fail to promptly abate a public nuisance;

      3.   Minimize expense and delay where the alternative remedy
is to pursue responsible parties in the civil or criminal justice system. 
(Ord. 2004-10 § 3(part), 2004)



8.25.020  ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS.



   A.   General. This section makes any violation of the provisions of
this Code subject to civil fine.

      1.   This section establishes the administrative procedures
for the imposition, enforcement, collection, and administrative review of
civil fines pursuant to Government Code § 53069.4 and the city's plenary
police power.

      2.   The issuance of an administrative citation under this
section is solely at the city's discretion and is one option the city has to
address violations of this code.  By adopting this section, the city does
not intend to limit its discretion to utilize any other remedy, civil or
criminal, for such violations that the city may select in a particular case.

      3.   The purpose of issuing administrative citations pursuant
to this section is to encourage voluntary and complete compliance with the
provisions of this code for the protection and benefit of the entire
community.

      4.   Notwithstanding any lease, license or any other
instrument or agreement, the owner of any real property has the right to
enter upon his or her own property to the extent reasonably necessary to
abate any nuisance or correct any violation of this code existing thereon. 
The provisions of this section shall be an implied term of any instrument
affecting the right to possession of real property located in the city. 

      5.   Because of the serious blighting conditions that can
result affecting the residents' health and safety, this section is intended
to impose strict civil liability upon the owners and lessees of real property
for all building, housing, fire and health code and zoning violations that
occur upon the subject premises.

      6.   Administrative citations are available as a remedy, in
addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which may be pursued
by the city to address any violation of this chapter.  Whenever a code
enforcement officer, or other official designated by the City Manager,
determines that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the official shall
have the authority to impose an administrative fine on any person responsible
for the violation. If the violation pertains to a building, plumbing,
electrical, or other similar structural or zoning issue, that does not create
an immediate danger to health or safety, the person responsible for the
continuing violation shall be afforded thirty days to correct or otherwise
remedy the violation prior to the imposition of an administrative fine.

   B.   Form of citation. The administrative citation shall contain the
following information:

      1.   The date of the violation.

      2.   The address or a description of the location where the
violation occurred.

      3.   The section of the code that was violated along with a
description of the violation.

      4.   The amount of the fine date by which payment must be
submitted unless an appeal hearing has been requested.

Manager or City Attorney for enforcement or cost recovery purposes.

   C.   Service of the citation. The citation shall be personally
served upon the citee or shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the citee.  If the citee is a property owner within the City
and cannot be personally served, the citation shall be sent to the property
owner by certified mail, return receipt requested at the address where the
violation occurred and to the address of record shown on the most recent
assessment roll.

   D.   Appeal Hearing.

      1.   The recipient of an administrative citation may request,
in writing, a hearing before the Board of Appeals established pursuant to
section 8.24.070 of this code.

      2.   The request for hearing shall be filed with the office of
the City Manager within thirty days from the date of service of the
citation.  A copy of the citation and an address for providing notice of the
hearing and decision shall be included with the written request.

      3.   As soon as practicable after receiving the written
request for hearing, the City Manager shall fix a date, time and place for
the hearing by the Board.  Such date shall not be less than five days nor
more than thirty days from the date the appeal was filed with the City
Manager.  Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given
at least five days prior to the date of the hearing to the party contesting
the citation by the City Manager either by causing a copy of such notice to
be delivered to the appellant personally or by mailing a copy thereof,
postage prepaid, addressed to the citee at the address shown on the request
for hearing.

      4.   The administrative citation and any additional report
submitted by the code enforcement officer shall constitute prima facie
evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents.  The code
enforcement officer may provide additional evidence and testimony at the
hearing.  Non-appearance of the code enforcement officer shall not affect
the final decision of the Board.

      5.    At the hearing, the person cited shall be given the
opportunity to testify and to present evidence concerning the administrative
citation, including any request to reduce the amount of the fine to be
imposed.  In lieu of appearance, the citee may file a written declaration
with the Board signed under penalty of perjury prior to the hearing date.  A
failure to file a written declaration before the hearing or personally attend
the hearing will be considered a non-appearance.  Non-appearance by the
citee shall not affect the final decision of the Board.

      6.   The Board shall conduct the hearing pursuant to the
applicable procedures of Chapter 8.24 of this code.

terms of the administrative citation, including the amount of any fine and
the time for making payment of any fine, through a written decision.  The
written decision shall be served pursuant to Section 8.25.020(C) within ten
days after the hearing.  The written decision shall be final and conclusive.

   E.   Amount of fine. A first violation shall be subject to a fine of
no more than one hundred dollars.  A second violation during the same
twelve-month period shall be subject to a fine of no more than  two hundred
dollars.  A third or subsequent violation during the same twelve-month
period shall be subject to a fine of no more than five hundred dollars.  The
City Manager or his/her designee may establish a schedule of fines for
specific sections of this Code or may provide a fine for a specific violation.

   F.   Payment of the Fine.

      1.   The citee shall pay the fine indicated on the
administrative citation by remitting payment to the city within thirty days
from the date of service of the citation. This requirement for payment of the
fine shall be tolled during the pendency of an appeal of the citation.

      2.   Where the Board of Appeals has sustained the
administrative citation and upheld or modified the fine, the citee shall
remit payment of the fine to the city as indicated within the Board's written
decision.

      3.   If the fine is not paid within applicable time period,
the city may use all available legal means to collect any past due
administrative citation fines or late payment charges.

   G.   Judicial Appeal. Any person aggrieved by the Board of Appeal's
decision on an administrative citation may appeal the decision by filing a
petition for review in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the
provisions set forth in Government Code Section 53069.4. (Ord. 2004-10 §

administrative or civil action to seek recovery of costs related to its
effort to abate the public nuisance, including seeking payment as a personal

certificate of compliance within six (6) months after obtaining an
inspection, the Development Services Department may, in its discretion,
require the property owner verify the condition of the inspected balcony is
unchanged before issuing a certificate of compliance.

in writing.

8.36.070  RIGHT OF ENTRY.



   The Development Services Director, or his or her designee, may enter,
conduct an inspection, and test any building balcony, or premise to secure
compliance or prevent a violation of this chapter.  Unless there is an
emergency threatening the public health, safety or welfare, the Development

the property owner and/or tenant of intent to enter upon the property.  The
Development Services Director may also request that a property owner provide
all written records of inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement at the
time of inspection of the building balcony or within ten (10) or more

with this chapter.  When all conditions are met to the satisfaction of the
City, the building balcony shall be certified as complying with the
provisions of the Pinole Municipal Code.  The City shall thereupon issue a
certificate of compliance to the property owner, noting that the balcony has
been inspected and meets the requirements of the City.  A copy of the
certificate of compliance will be kept by the City as record for the
inspected property.  Once a certificate of compliance is issued, the
building balcony for which the certificate of compliance is issued shall not
require testing for a period of five (5) years from the date of issuance of
the certificate of compliance subject to Section 8.36.030.  The certificate
of compliance shall not imply a warranty or guarantee of any kind.

8.36.090  HARDSHIP REFERRALS FOR REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT.



   A.   In the event that the property owner establishes to the
satisfaction of the City that repair or replacement of a building balcony in
a non-probate sale will result in undue hardship inconsistent with the
purpose or intent of this chapter, a written request for hardship status may
be submitted to the Development Services Director.  The Development Services
Director shall make a hardship finding only if the requesting property owner
presents written facts that clearly demonstrate (in the Development Services
Director 's sole discretion) that the property owner's payment for and
completion of a building balcony repair or replacement at the required time
would result in an undue hardship.  If hardship status is granted, the
property owner who is selling the property, or the purchaser of such property
may request the City to defer the building balcony repair up to one hundred
and eighty (180) days.



   B.   For purposes of this section, UNDUE HARDSHIP shall be defined
as:



      1.   The severe illness or incapacitation of the property
owner;



      2.   The immediate transfer or removal of the property owner
from the state, thereby making the hiring of a contractor to repair or
replace the building balcony impractical or overly burdensome; or



      3.   Any physical or financial situation that would render
compliance with the time limits for the repair or replacement of building
balcony extraordinarily difficult or impractical.



   The property owner shall bear the burden of submitting documentation
and proving the existence of such a bona fide hardship to the satisfaction of
the Development Services Director.



   C.   Any property owner to whom a hardship finding is granted shall
be given written notice of the finding.  Said notice shall inform the
property owner that the building balcony repair or replacement requirement is
only deferred up to one hundred eighty (180) days.  A copy of the notice
shall be sent to both the property owner and, if applicable, the purchaser of
the property.



   D.   In the event of a failure to comply with this chapter within
the allotted time, the City may bring an enforcement action and exercise any
other remedy provided by the Municipal Code and/or applicable law against the
property owner and any other responsible party.  In addition thereto, any
property owner who fails to fully comply with this chapter shall be
responsible for all damages that arise from or relate to such failure.  For
purposes of this section, DAMAGES include all compensatory damages, fines,
penalties, assessments, attorneys' fees, costs and other monetary exactions
that may be awarded to, levied or assessed by any person, firm, corporation,
company or public entity. 



(Ord. 2017-06 § 2 (part), 2017)



8.36.100  TEMPORARY RESALE CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.



   If the owner cannot complete all work needed to remove or mitigate
potential threats to the health and safety of the occupants or future
occupants caused by the condition of a balcony before the anticipated date of
close of escrow, the buyer may file with the Development Services Director a
written application for a temporary resale certificate of compliance. Upon
approval of the application and issuance of a temporary resale certificate of
compliance by the Development Services Director to the buyer, the buyer shall
assume all obligations of the owner as specified in this chapter, and shall
comply with the city's codes so as to remove or mitigate, within ninety (90)
days of close of escrow, the potential threats to the health and safety of

9.28.010  FINDINGS.



   The City Council finds that:



   A.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has determined that
tobacco smoke is the major contributor of particulate indoor air pollution;
and



   B.   Reliable studies have shown that breathing sidestream or
secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard, in particular for elder
people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with
impaired respiratory function; including asthmatics and those with
obstructive airway disease; and



   C.   Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand
smoke include heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased
exercise tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and
bronchospasm; and



   D.   Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who
suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke may
experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick
leave because of adverse reactions to same; and



   E.   The smoking of tobacco is a danger to health; and



   F.   The health care costs and lost productivity incurred by smoking
related disease and death represent a heavy and avoidable financial drain on
our community by increasing public health and medical costs;



   G.   Exposure to secondhand smoke anywhere has negative health
impacts, exposure to secondhand smoke does occur at significant levels
outdoors, and to be completely free from exposure to secondhand smoke a
person may need to move up to 20 feet away from the source of the smoke; and



   H.   1.   The free distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco
products encourages people to begin smoking and using tobacco products and
tempts those who had quit smoking to begin smoking again, and



      2.   Free distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco
products promotes unsightly litter, thereby increasing the costs to the
public in cleaning the streets; and also causes pedestrian traffic
congestion. (Ord. 2019-06 (part), 2019; Ord. 2010-01 § 1(part), 2010; Ord.
562 § 2 (part), 1994).

9.36.010  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   The City Council finds and declares that there exists in the city a
tendency toward a display of adult magazines, books and video cassette tapes
in liquor stores, video rental stores and other retail outlets in such a
manner that children, often of tender years, are exposed to magazine, book
and video cassette tape covers depicting explicit sexual activity and showing
human genitals and pubic regions in a sexually explicit manner. The City
Council finds that such exposure establishes a tone in the community
inconsistent with morality and good order and creates a public nuisance.



   The City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the public
health, safety and welfare to regulate the display of reading materials with
sexually explicit covers and to adopt the regulations set out in this chapter
so that the adverse impacts of such material on children and the community as
a whole will be kept to a minimum. (Ord. 576 § 1(part), 1995).



9.36.020  DEFINITIONS.



   The following words, terms and phrases used in this chapter shall be
defined, as follows:



   COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT.  Any place of business in the city where
minors are permitted.



   EXPLICIT SEXUAL DEPICTIONS.  Any picture, photograph, drawing,

breast or breasts, except those of prepubescent minors;



   2.   The entire genitalia or buttocks of either males or females,
except those of prepubescent minors;



   3.   Stimulation of human genitals or otherwise emphasizing the
genitals;



   4.   Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse, sodomy,

sadomasochism or similar acts;



   5.   Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic

periodical which reports or describes current events and which, from time to
time, publishes photographs of nude or seminude persons in connection with
dissemination of the news. Nor does this definition apply to publications
which describe and report on different cultures and which, from time to time,
publish photographs or depictions of nude or seminude persons when describing
cultures in which nudity or seminudity is indigenous to the population.
Medical publications or bona fide educational publications do not usually

9.36.040  ESTABLISHMENTS WITH “ADULTS ONLY” AREAS.



   Except as authorized in Section 9.36.050, reading material having
covers with explicit sexual depictions may be displayed in a commercial
establishment in an area set aside and clearly posted for adults only. Adults

PROHIBITION OF DRIVING MOTOR VEHICLES UPON ANY PROPERTY
WHICH IS NOT A PUBLIC STREET OR A PRIVATE STREET



Sections:



   10.34.010   Definitions.



   10.34.020   Motor vehicle prohibition.



   10.34.030   Necessity for chapter.



10.34.010  DEFINITIONS.



   A.   MOTOR VEHICLE.  As defined in the California Vehicle Code,
means and includes, but is not limited to, vehicles commonly referred to as
motor scooter, four-wheel drive vehicles, motorcycle, motorbike, dune buggy
and sand buggy.



   B.   STREET.   The terms street or highway as defined in the
California Vehicle Code. (Ord. 533 § 1(part), 1990).



10.34.020  MOTOR VEHICLE PROHIBITION.



   A.   No person shall drive a motor vehicle upon any property which
is not a public or private street or highway.



   B.   Exception. This section shall not apply where such motor
vehicle is being driven upon property by the property owner, resident,
regular occupant or authorized visitor for the purpose of ingress or egress
to such property. (Ord. 533 § 1(part), 1990).



10.34.030  NECESSITY FOR CHAPTER. 



   This chapter is declared to be necessary in order to protect the public
health, safety, peace and general welfare of the citizens of the city for the
following reasons:



   A.   The City Council finds that the operation of motor vehicles on
property which is not a public street or a private street creates a public
nuisance and damage to the environment as follows:



   1.   Such activities are conducted primarily as a recreational or
leisure time pursuit, often by large numbers of drivers and passengers, and
have no relationship to the economic use of the land or property being
utilized by the owners.



   2.   Such activity predominately occurs on unimproved property
within the city and raises dust, creates excessive noise, destroys natural
vegetation and erodes the natural terrain.



   3.   Often such activity is a trespass upon private or public
property.



   4.   Noise emitted by motorcycles, motor-driven cycles or similar
motor vehicles creates a substantial nuisance far in excess of other
contributions to the normal noise level of the surrounding environment.



   5.   Control of such activity through existing laws relating to
trespass, nuisance, noise condition, zoning and traffic are cumbersome,
impractical and ineffective. (Ord. 533 § 1 (part), 1990).

traffic engineer determines that there is a particular hazard to pedestrians
crossing the roadway subject to the limitation contained in subsection B of
this section.



   B.   Other than crosswalks at intersections, no crosswalk shall be
established in any block which is less than four hundred feet in length and
such crosswalk shall be located as nearly as practicable at midblock. (Ord.
432 § 2(part), 1982).

   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the state under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to
remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings
and declarations:



   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not
including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value
of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite
plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage
for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not
including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to
constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 502 § 2(part), 1987).

other action as he or she deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry
out the purpose of this chapter. He or she may delay the time for removal of

find that a vehicle or parts thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled,
or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed
from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as hereinafter

charged against the owner of the land. The chief of police shall prepare and

order. Any order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle
or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license number of
the vehicle, if available, at the site.

on the land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he or she
has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the chief of police shall
not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the
property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect
such costs from such owner of the land.

   PARADE.   Any march, athletic event, demonstration, or procession for
an event consisting of persons, animals or vehicles or any combination
thereof upon a public street, sidewalk, alley or other public place which
does not comply with normal or usual traffic regulations or control. (Ord.
481 § 1(part), 1986).



10.70.020  EXCEPTIONS. 



   The word “parade,” as used in this chapter, shall not apply to any
of the following:



   A.   A funeral procession;



   B.   A governmental agency acting within the scope of its functions;



   C.   Students going to and from school classes or participating in
educational activities, provided such activity is under the immediate
supervision of school authorities authorized by the school district to
approve and supervise such activity. (Ord. 481 § 1(part), 1986).



10.70.030  APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.



   A.   Any person desiring to conduct a parade, except as provided in
Section 10.70.040, shall file an application with the chief of police not
less than fifteen days prior to the proposed assembly time for the parade.
Application shall be on forms provided by and available at the police
department.



   B.   Said application shall contain:



      1.   The name of the applicant, the sponsoring organization,
the parade chairman and the addresses and telephone numbers of each; the
assembly area, disbanding area, and the route to be traveled; the assembly
time, and the starting time;



      2.   So far as is reasonably practicable, the anticipated
number of parade participants, the disbanding time; the maximum parade
length; the total number of bands, sound vehicles or musical units, if any,
with the type and number of members in each a unit; the number of animals, if
any, and type; the number of floats, if any, with their type, size, and
method of moving; and the space between the units and their speed;



      3.   The purpose of the parade. This application requirement
is intended to allow the police chief to anticipate and provide for
additional police services, if necessary, to protect the safety or parade
participants and bystanders. No denial of a parade permit shall be based on
the purpose given for the parade, if such purpose is constitutionally
protected;



      4.   A statement as to whether a permit has been requested or
obtained from any other jurisdiction within which said parade shall commence,
pass or terminate.



   C.   If such a parade is designed to be held by and on behalf of, or
for, any organization other than the applicant, the applicant for such permit
shall file a communication in writing from such organization, authorizing the
applicant to apply for such permit on its behalf. (Ord. 481 § 1(part), 1986).



10.70.040  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT.



   Prior to the issuance of a parade permit, the permit applicant and
authorized officer of the sponsoring organization (if any), must sign an
agreement to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by it in repairing
damage to city property occurring in connection with the permitted event
proximately caused by the actions of the permittee/sponsoring organization,
its officers, employees, or agents, or any person who was under the
permittee's/sponsoring organization's control insofar as permitted by law.
The agreement shall also provide that the permittee/sponsoring organization
shall defend the city against, and indemnify and hold the city harmless from,
any liability to any persons resulting from any damage or injury occurring in
connection with the permitted event proximately caused by the actions of the
permittee/sponsoring organization, its officers, employees or agents, or any
person who was under the permittee's/sponsoring organization's control
insofar as permitted by law. Persons who merely join in a parade or event are
not considered by that reason alone to be “under control” of the
permittee/sponsoring organization. (Ord. 481 § 1 (part), 1986).



10.70.050  INSURANCE.



   A.   The applicant/sponsor of an event must possess or obtain public
liability insurance to protect against loss from liability imposed by law for
damages on account of bodily injury and property damage arising from the
event. Insurance coverage must be maintained for the duration of the event.



   B.   Coverage shall consist of the following:



      1.   General Liability. The applicant/sponsor shall maintain
general liability coverage with a minimum one million dollar combined single
limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage.
If commercial general liability insurance or other form with a general
aggregate limit is used, either the general aggregate limit shall apply
separately to this event or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the
required current limit.



      2.   Worker's Compensation Insurance. The applicant/sponsor
shall maintain Worker's Compensation and Employers Liability insurance for
all of its employees as required by the Labor Code and employer's liability
limits of one million dollars per accident.



      3.   Automobile Liability. The applicant/sponsor shall
maintain automobile liability insurance covering bodily injury and property
damage in an amount of not less than one million dollars combined single
limit for each occurrence.



   C.   Endorsements. A copy of the policy or certificate of insurance,
along with all the necessary endorsements, must be filed with the chief of
police no less than five days before the date of the event unless the chief
of police for good cause waives the filing deadline. The following
endorsements must be indicated on the policy and/or the certificate:



      1.   The city, its board, officers and employees are
additionally insured under the policy as to the activities and operations
being performed under this agreement and/or license;



      2.   The coverage is primary and no other insurance carried by
applicant/sponsor will be called upon to contribute to a loss under this
coverage;



      3.   The policy covers blanket contractual liability;



      4.   The policy limits of liability are provided on an
occurrence basis;

injury liability;

liability coverage must include a liquor liability endorsement;



      8.   The policy covers products and completed operations;



      9.   The policy covers use of non-owned automobiles;



      10.   The coverage shall not be canceled nor materially
altered unless thirty days' written notice is given to licensor.



   D.   The special event permit shall not be issued until after the
insurance policy or certificate of insurance, along with necessary
endorsements, have been filed by the applicant/sponsor and approved by the
chief of police.



   E.   The insurance requirements of subsections A through C of this
section shall be waived by the chief of police for nonathletic events if the
following conditions are satisfied:



      1.   The applicant or an office of the sponsoring organization
signs a verified statement that he or she believes the event's purpose is
First Amendment expression, and that he or she has determined that the cost
of obtaining insurance is so financially burdensome that it would constitute
an unreasonable burden on the right of First Amendment expression; or



      2.   That it has been impossible to obtain insurance coverage.
The statement shall include the name and address of one insurance agent or
other source for insurance coverage contacted to determine insurance premium
rates for insurance coverage. (Ord. 581 § 1, 1996: Ord. 481 § 1(part),
1986).



10.70.060  LATE APPLICATIONS.



   A.   Any application received less than fifteen days before the
proposed parade is a late application. The chief of police shall deny
issuance of a parade permit to late applicants unless he or she finds one of
the following conditions to be present:



      1.   Prior application was impossible since the parade is in
response to an event of national or state importance which occurred less than
fifteen days before the proposed parade date.



      2.   The applicant used due diligence but was not able to
apply for a parade permit in a timely manner due to circumstances beyond his
or her control.



   B.   When the chief of police finds one of the above conditions to
exist, he or she shall consider the application and base his or her decision
on the criteria enumerated in Section 10.70.080 of this chapter. (Ord. 481 §
1(part), 1986).

proposed parade shall be acted upon at least seven days prior to the-proposed
assembly time for the parade.



   B.   Late applications shall be acted upon at least one day prior to
the proposed assembly time for the parade. (Ord. 481 § 1(part), 1986).



10.70.080  DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.



   A. Permits may be denied or revoked by the chief of police only upon
his or her determination that one or more of the following conditions exist:



      1.   There is insufficient time for the police department to
make necessary preparations or inquiry concerning traffic control or other
public safety matters prior to the proposed parade date;



      2.   That the number of persons who would be seriously
inconvenienced would be grossly disproportionate to the number of
participants in the parade;



      3.   That the parade will occur between the hours of 6:30 a.m.
to 9:30 a.m. or 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday or on any day

      4.   That the parade will exceed three hours' duration;



      5.   That the parade will unduly interfere with ingress to,
egress from, or travel on a freeway, state designated highway, or main
thoroughfare of the city;



      6.   That the application is incomplete for failure to contain
the information required in Section 10.70.030(B) of this chapter;



      7.   That the application contains a false statement as to a
material fact;



      8.   That a significant number of the parade participants
intent to engage in or provoke violence;



      9.   That the parade will conflict with a previously scheduled
parade;



      10.   That safe conduct of the parade would require the
diversion of so great a number of city police officers as to impair the
normal police protection of the city;



      11.   That adequate clean up of litter or debris resulting
from the parade has not been assured by the applicant when such litter
debris, is a foreseeable and likely result of the parade;



      12.   That the parade is to be held for the principal purpose
of advertising a product or event for private profit;



      13.   That the parade activity or parade route would
unreasonably interfere with proper fire or police protection within an area
of the city.



   B.   Written reasons shall be given to an applicant by the chief of
police on the original application form to explain denial or revocation of a
permit. (Ord. 481 § 1(part), 1986).

12.32.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of these regulations is to acknowledge and achieve the
following:



   A.   There is a substantial government interest in promoting the
public health, safety, welfare and convenience by ensuring that persons may
reasonably use the public streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way, and other public
property without interference with such use.



   B.   Newsracks placed and maintained on the streets, sidewalks, or
other public rights-of-way, absent some reasonable regulation, may
unreasonably interfere with the use of such streets, sidewalks, and public
rights-of-way, and may present some hazards to persons or property.



   C.   The streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way are
historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and
other publications, and that access to and use of these areas for such
purposes is not to be denied except where such use unreasonably interferes
with the use of these areas by pedestrians or traffic, or where such use
presents a hazard to persons or property.



   D.   Reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be
achieved by adoption of this chapter, which regulates the placement and
maintenance of newsracks.



   E.   The public health, safety, welfare and convenience require that
interference with vehicular, bicycle, wheelchair or pedestrian traffic be
avoided; obstruction of sight distance and views of traffic and identifying
signs and street-crossing pedestrians be eliminated; damage done to sidewalks
or streets be minimized and repaired; the good appearance of the public
streets or grounds be maintained; trees and other landscaping be allowed to
grow without disturbance; access to emergency and other public facilities be
maintained; and ingress and egress from properties adjoining the public
rights-of-way be protected and reasonable commercial uses on private property
not be impeded or interfered with.



   F.   The regulation of the sale or free distribution of newspapers
and other publications dispensed in vending machines as set forth in this
chapter provides the least intrusive and burdensome means for ensuring the
purposes stated in this section are carried out while still providing ample
opportunities for the distribution of news to the citizens of the city. (Ord.
98-100 § 1(part), 1998).

13.05.010  PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   A.   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for contributors
to the wastewater collection and treatment system of the Pinole/Hercules
water pollution control plant and enables the city to comply with all
applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 as
amended and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403), on file
at the public works department.



   B.   The objectives of this chapter are:



      1.   Comply with the laws of the state of California and of
the United States relating to the protection of the environment, control of
water pollution, disposal of hazardous wastes and pretreatment of industrial
discharges to publicly owned treatment works;



      2.   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the city's
wastewater system, which could interfere with operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;



      3.   Prevent the introduction of wastes into the city's
wastewater system, which could pass through the system, inadequately treated
and into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible
with the system's overall operations;

plan to contribute to the city facilities, shall make application for a
wastewater discharge permit. This application shall be made before connecting
to or contributing to the city facilities, or within ninety days after the
enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter in the event user is
currently connected and not currently permitted. All existing industrial
users connected to or contributing to the city facilities shall be required
to obtain a new wastewater discharge permit upon the expiration of their
existing permit. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.170  ADMINISTRATION – CLASSES OF USERS.



   A.   The city will Classify all users in accordance with the
principal activity conducted on the premises where the discharge occurs. The
purpose of the classification is to facilitate regulation of discharges to
city facilities on the basis of each user's waste quality, quantity, and
flow. The classification shall further provide a means of imposing an
appropriate level of oversight, control, and enforcement according to the
source of discharge. The classification system will also allow equitable
recovery of city capital and operating costs for the source control program.
As set forth in the definition section of this chapter, there are two
categories of users, one domestic users, and the other industrial users.
Industrial users are categorized as Class I or II.



   B.   All users are subject to the prohibitions set forth in this
chapter, with such federal and state statutes and regulations as may apply,
and the specific pollutant limitations as may be promulgated by the city
either by ordinance or by resolution.



   C.   Domestic users under normal circumstances will not be required
to apply or receive a wastewater discharge permit as defined in this chapter,
providing that the domestic user discharges only waste water which is
consistent with the definition of domestic wastewater set forth herein.



   D.   Industrial users may be subject to wastewater discharge permit
requirements depending on the volume, characteristics, and origin of their
wastewater discharge. Industrial users may be required to supply such
information and data concerning their processes,



including discharge samples, as may be necessary for the city to determine
whether such user should be designated a Class I or II. Industrial users
must, when requested, provide such other information regarding the nature of
the entity, its operations, storage and use of chemicals, and storage and use
of hazardous substances, as may be reasonably necessary to make such
determination, as to the classification of the user. The city may also
require information relating to potential for accidental discharges to the
city facility of hazardous or prohibited substances. Such inquires may
include information regarding the current disposal procedures of the user
with regard to chemicals and/or substances which are not in the ordinary
course of user's operations discharged to city facilities.



   E.   The determination by the city regarding the designation of an
industrial user as a Class I user may be based on the unusual character of
the wastewater due to its volume, strength, composition, or its derivation
from a hazardous waste or substance, or the potential variability in the
character of the wastewater or on the potential for increased cost to the
city due to the unusual character of the waste. Any administrative costs to
be considered may include increased potential for the administrative
oversight by federal, state, and local agencies as well as the potential for
increased liability exposure and associated legal costs. The city may also
take into consideration difficulties in enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter under a wastewater discharge permit and the enforcement violation and
compliance history of the user with the city, as well as other regulatory
agencies. The determination of the city regarding the designation of the
industrial user as a Class II user may be based on whether the discharge of
the wastewater is equal to or greater than five thousand gallons per average
workday flow, or whether the discharge has in its waste hazardous pollutants,
or whether the discharge is subject to national pretreatment standards, or
whether it has in its untreated wastewater pollutants which are in excess of
any pretreatment standard or requirement, including any pretreatment standard
or requirement identified in this chapter, or B4 ordinance or resolution or,
whether it may, in the opinion of the city, have a significant impact, either
singularly or in combination with other contributing industries, on the
city's ability to meet the objectives of this chapter. (Ord. 01-102 § 2
(part), 2001).

wastewater sewer service for violation of this chapter or other wastewater
permit contract conditions;



      4.   Any and all other conditions as may be deemed appropriate
by the city to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter and the
objectives set forth herein.



   F.   Permit Modifications. When a new National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard is promulgated, the wastewater permit of each user will
be revised to require compliance with such standard within the time for
compliance prescribed by such standard or within ninety days, which ever is
shorter. A user subject to national pretreatment standard, who has not
previously submitted an application, for a wastewater discharge permit as
required by Section 13.05.260 of this chapter, shall apply for a wastewater
discharge permit within ninety days after the promulgation of the applicable
national pretreatment standard. A user with an existing wastewater discharge
permit shall submit to the public works director within ninety days after the
promulgation of an applicable federal pretreatment standard the information
required by Section 13.05.180A.



   In the event the city determines that it is necessary in order to
comply with the objectives of the chapter to impose more stringent
limitations or requirements on dischargers to the wastewater disposal system
than are set forth in the existing permit (for reasons other than issuance of
new national pretreatment standard) the city shall have the right to require
such reasonable modifications of an existing permit to incorporate such more
stringent limitations or requirements. In the event such permit modification
is required, the user shall be provided with reasonable time to make such
modifications to its processes or procedures to meet the more stringent
requirements. If the permit modification requires construction or acquisition
of equipment related to pretreatment the compliance schedule will provide for
up to one hundred eighty days to comply; however, this period may be extended
by another one hundred eighty days by the director of public works if he or
she determines that good cause exists for an additional period, and that the
user remains in compliance with the permit conditions in effect prior to
amendment, during the compliance period.



   G.   Permit and Contract Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are
issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater permit will
not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a changed operation without the prior approval of the city. All
the terms and conditions will still apply to a preceding owner. (Ord. 01-102
§ 2(part), 2001).



13.05.190  ADMINISTRATION – REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Notification of a Slug Load or Accidental Discharge or
Accidental Spill. It is the responsibility of all industrial users to
immediately telephone and notify the city police. department of any slug load
or accidental discharge as described in Sections 13.05.030 and 13.05.130 of
this chapter. Notification shall include location of discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.



      1.   Written Notice. Within five days following the accidental
discharge or slug load, the user shall submit to the plant superintendent a
detailed written report describing the cause of the incident and the measures
to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage to
person or property or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to city facilities, fish kills, or any other damage to person or
property, nor shall notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.



      2.   Notice to Employees. Users who are employers shall ensure
that all their employees know whom to call in the event of such a discharge.
All the employees who may cause or suffer such discharge to occur are advised
of the emergency notification procedure.



   B.   Prior Notification of Change in Volume or Character of
Wastewater. All users shall promptly notify the city in writing (except in
emergencies, where telephone notification is



acceptable) prior to: (1) any new or increased discharge or any change in
nature of their discharge, which does not meet pretreatment standards or
requirements or has the reasonable potential to cause the city to violate its
NPDES permit or cause problems to the city wastewater system; (2) any
substantial change in volume or character of pollutants in their discharge.



   C.   Baseline Report. All Class I and II industrial users, subject
to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, shall submit to the city a
baseline report within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of
adoption of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or one hundred
eighty days after final decision on a category determination by EPA specified
in 40 CFR 403.12(b).



   D.   Compliance Report. Any new user upon commencing use of city
facilities or an existing user who has met the final compliance schedule
date, for applicable pretreatment standards, shall submit to the city, within
ninety days, a report, indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards or requirements, the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units, and the actual average production rate for these
process units. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirement are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
what additional operational and maintenance changes and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user and a certified qualified professional.
Filing of this compliance report cannot relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable law or failure to meet the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements subsequent to the date for final compliance with such applicable
standards.



   E.   Periodic Compliance Reports.



      1.   Class I and II industrial users shall submit a report to
the city twice a year, or more frequently as specified in the permit or
permit contract. The compliance report shall at a minimum contain the
following:



         a.   The nature and concentration of pollutants which
are limited by pretreatment standards or requirements or which are specified
in the permit for each regulated waste stream;



         b.   A record of average daily flow for the reporting
period for each regulated waste stream;



         c.   Methods utilized by the user in collecting the
wastewater sample for analysis, sampling device used, the sampling period,
the amount of each sample collected, sample handling and preservation
techniques used, and date of sample delivery to the laboratory for analysis;



         d.   In the event a sample from a periodic compliance
report indicates that a constituent is in violation of the allowable
concentration levels as set forth in the users permit, the user shall inform
the plant superintendent within the next business day, repeat the sampling
and pollutant analysis for the parameter in violation, and submit in writing
within thirty days of the discovery of the first violation. The sampling and
analysis report will also state the causes of the violation, the remedial
actions taken to date in response to the violation, and the scheduled
additional actions which will be implemented to prevent a reoccurrence. (Ord.
01-102 § 2 (part), 2001).



13.05.200  ADMINISTRATION  –  MONITORING.



   A.   Monitoring Requirements. Any user may be required to provide
wastewater sampling and/or monitoring results or to submit to monitoring by
the city to assist the city in establishing the appropriate Class of the user
and/or to evaluate compliance with the standards and the requirements of this
chapter.



      1.   Classification Sampling. All industrial users may be
required to sample. and analyze their waste streams to determine the
appropriate class of the user. Classification sampling shall be at the city's
request. The number and type of samples and pollutants analyzed shall be as
specified by the city in order to adequately characterize the user's
wastewater discharge.



      2.   Baseline Sampling. All Class I and II industrial users
shall sample and analyze their regulated waste stream(s) as part of a permit
application or modification of a permit as specified in Sections 13.05.180(A)
and 13.05.180(F) of this chapter. In addition all Class I and II industrial
users are required to submit baseline reports as specified in Section
13.05.190(C).



      3.   Initial Compliance Sampling. All Class I and II
industrial users shall sample and analyze their regulated waste stream(s) for
the compliance report as specified in Section 13.05.190(D) of this chapter.
Samples shall be analyzed for those pollutants regulated in the applicable
pretreatment or as required by the city.



      4.   Periodic Compliance Sampling. All Class I and II
industrial users shall sample and analyze their regulated waste stream(s) to
evaluate compliance, with the users permit or permit contract. Periodic
compliance monitoring shall be conducted at least twice each year unless
specified more frequently in the users permit or in the applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard. Samples will be analyzed for those
pollutants regulated in the applicable pretreatment standard or as otherwise
required by the city.



      5.   Confirmation Sampling. Whenever sampling results indicate
that the user's regulated waste stream(s) is in violation of any pretreatment
standard or requirement, the user shall collect a second sample to assess the
degree of violation. For the second sample, the user shall analyze only for
the pollutant(s) found to be in violation. The user shall provide the city
with the results from the confirmation sampling within thirty days of the
date the violation was discovered.



      6.   Sampling and Evaluation Program. If confirmation sampling
indicates a second violation, then the city may initiate a sampling and
evaluation program (SEP). The SEP will be conducted by the city and may
include collection of three to five samples. The SEP will establish whether
there is continued noncompliance by the user. Samples collected during the
SEP may be analyzed for other pollutants in addition to the pollutant(s) in
violation.



      7.   City Sampling. The city may collect and analyze samples
on its own or request the user to split samples to evaluate compliance with
this chapter or the user's permit. The city also reserves the right to
conduct all sampling and analysis for the user with all the cost to be paid
by the user. In the event the data obtained by the city differs from data
provided by the user, the city data shall be presumed accurate unless and
until the user provides substantial evidence otherwise. In the event the city
performs the sampling, whether announced or unannounced, the user may request
that the city split the samples and provide one of the split samples for the
user's independent analysis.



   B.   Sampling Procedures. All sampling and testing undertaken for
the purpose of compliance. with the sampling and reporting requirements of
this chapter shall be undertaken in the manner set forth herein. Except as
otherwise provided in this section or as otherwise agreed in writing by the
city, samples for pH, cyanide, sulfide, phenols, oil and grease and volatile
organics shall consist of grab samples. A minimum of four grab samples shall
be taken for the referenced constituents throughout the entire process
discharge period.



      Each grab sample for the referenced, constituents will be
individually preserved and kept separate, and will be composited only by the
testing laboratory prior to analysis. Composite samples will be taken for all
other pollutants, one sample every hour throughout the discharge period, or a
twenty-four-hour period as required by the city. Each regulated waste stream
shall be sampled and analyzed separately unless the user's permit allows for
sampling and analyzing the combined waste streams.



      The methods of obtaining the sample shall be specified by the
city in the user's permit. The city may state special sampling requirements
as needed to insure compliance with this chapter.



   C.   Analytical Procedures. All samples will be preserved and
analyzed in accordance with the procedures presented in the Code of Federal
Regulations Title 40, Part 136 (Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for
the Analysis of Pollutants). Unless approved otherwise by the city, all
analyses shall be performed by a laboratory(s) certified by the state for the
specific pollutants and matrix to be analyzed.



   D.   Sampling Records. The user shall record and maintain, the
following information, for each sampling event:



      1.   The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and
the names of person or persons taking samples,



      2.   Sample preservation. used;



      3.   The date's analyses were performed;



      4.   Chain of custody of sample;



      5.   Who performed the analyses;



      6.   The analytical techniques/methods used;



      7.   The results of such analyses.



   E.   Monitoring Facilities. The city may require to be provided and
operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of regulated discharge. The
monitoring facility shall be accessible to city staff at all times and should
be normally situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located
so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.



      There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
(Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.210  ADMINISTRATION – REQUIREMENTS.



   All applications, reports, or other information submitted to the city
must contain the following certification statement.



I certify under penalty of perjury that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision and in accordance with the
system designed to insure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on, my inquiry of the personnel(s)
who manage the system, or those directly responsible for gathering the
information the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for knowingly submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and/or imprisonment for knowing violations.



   This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user as defined in 40 CPR 403.12(I)(1-4). (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part),
2001).



13.05.220  ADMINISTRATION – RIGHTS OF ENTRY.



   A.   The city has the right of inspection of the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether or not the objectives of this chapter are being met
and all standards and requirements are being complied with. Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is generated or discharged, or where
hazardous substances or hazardous wastes are present, shall allow the city or
their representative ready access at all reasonable times of day or night,
upon reasonable notice to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling, analysis, records examination and copying, or the
review of any of their duties. The city, or its authorized representative,
accompanied by such other representatives of other public agencies as may be
appropriate, shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance,
monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a security system is in force,
the user shall make necessary arrangements, permit from the city along with
other authorized representatives, on the premises, without delay, for the
purpose of performing their responsibilities.



   B.   Such inspections shall be made with the consent of the owner or
possessor of such facilities or if such consent is refused, with a warrant
duly issued, provided however, that in the event of an emergency affecting
public health or safety, such inspections may be made without consent or the
issuance of a warrant. To the extent that the owner or the possessor of the
premises requires that a warrant be received, the city may, in its
discretion, suspend the permit and or any other right to discharge to
sanitary facilities immediately, and such suspension may continue until such
time as a warrant has been received and the inspection has been completed.
(Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.230  ADMINISTRATION – PRETREATMENT.



   Users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all national
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the
federal regulations, or this chapter or the permit, whichever is earliest.
Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the
city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the
city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to
the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or the method of operation shall be reported to and
be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
(Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.240  ADMINISTRATION – PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT
NONCOMPLIANCE.



   Pursuant to federal requirements, the city shall annually publish in
the largest daily newspaper within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city
a list of users, which were in significant noncompliance with any
pretreatment requirements or standards during the twelve previous months. The
notification shaft also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the
user(s) during the same twelve months. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.250  ADMINISTRATION – RECORDS RETENTION.



   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment requirements or
standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA, state, and city,
or their authorized representatives. These records shall be maintained for a
minimum of three years from the date of the compliance report to which these
records are applicable or three years from any investigation or enforcement
action undertaken by the city, state or EPA has been concluded, except where
there is unresolved litigation regarding the user or the city to which such
records are relevant, in which cases the records will be retained until the
litigation is concluded. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.260  ADMINISTRATION – CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   A.   All information and data relating to a user's facilities
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits,
monitoring programs, and inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agencies without notification unless the user specifically
requests confidentiality, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the city that the release of such information is proprietary in nature.



   B.   The portions of such information which are proprietary in
nature shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be
made available upon request to other governmental agencies for purposes
related to this chapter, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) and or pretreatment program. Those portions of the information shall
also be available for use by any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the user. Waste-constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. The
burden will be on the user to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city
that information and data requested from the user is proprietary.



   C.   Any information accepted by the city as confidential shall not
be transmitted to anyone except the Environmental Protection Agency, the
State Water Quality Control Board, and/or the Regional Water Quality Control
Board, until and unless a ten-day notice is given to the user. (Ord. 01-102
§ 2(part), 2001).



13.05.270  ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM.



   The enforcement mechanisms available to the city for violations of the
provisions of this chapter, applicable city resolutions, and permit
provisions include the following:



   A.   Informal administrative action including notification of
violations (NOV's) and warning notices;



   B.   Administrative orders;



   C.   Instituting of sampling and evaluation programs, enforcement
compliance schedule agreements, and related administrative orders;



   D.   Assessment of charges for obstruction or damage to city
facilities or operations;



   E.   Suspension or termination of services;



   F.   Administrative civil penalties;



   G.   Civil action;



   H.   Criminal action. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.280  ENFORCEMENT– INFORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS.



   City staff may, on an informal basis, take action against a discharger
for minor violations or technical or clerical shortcomings of a user or
user's compliance submittals. These informal administrative actions may
include informal notices (i.e., telephone calls to the user's
representative), notice of violation (NOV), and informal meetings or informal
warning letters. Such action will not prevent a subsequent or concurrent
imposition of other enforcement mechanisms. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.290  ENFORCEMENT – ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS AND COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.



   A.   When the city finds that a user has violated the prohibitions
or requirements of this chapter or the provisions of a wastewater discharge
permit, the city may issue an administrative order directed at the user to:
(1) cease to discharge (suspension of services); (2) comply with requirements
immediately; or (3) make such changes to their pretreatment facility and
procedures to ensure full compliance.



   B.   The city may issue, under the circumstances set forth above, an
order containing a compliance schedule setting forth dates by which specific
corrective actions must be completed. (Ord. 01-102 § 2 (part), 2001).



13.05.300 ENFORCEMENT – SAMPLING EVALUATION PROGRAMS.



   A.   Grounds for Initiating Sampling and Evaluation (S & E)
Programs. In addition to those grounds set forth in Section 13.05.200,
Administration – Monitoring, grounds for instituting an S & E program
include compliance sampling having indicated a significant noncompliance
(SNC). The S & E program may consist of daily required sampling of the user's
for up to five days. The city or outside laboratory will analyze these
samples for the violating constituents and provide notice to the user of the
results of the sampling. Violations, which may occur during the S & E
program, shall constitute violations under this chapter or under any
applicable law.



   B.   S & E Program Revealing Noncompliance. If the S & E program
reveals noncompliance by the user with the prohibitions or specific pollutant
limitations specified in this chapter or in the user's permit:



      1.   The user may be assessed all costs incurred during the S
& E program for sampling and analysis, including labor, equipment, materials,
outside services, and overhead.



      2.   The city may place the user on a compliance schedule or
undertake another S & E program. The compliance schedule shall provide for
minimum required actions to be undertaken by the discharger and a schedule
for completion of the actions. The compliance schedule may include interim
constituent maximum level. All violations of constituent maximums or other
requirements set forth in the compliance schedule, including failure to meet
schedule dates shall constitute violations of this chapter and other
applicable laws. Each day a discharger fails to meet a schedule date shall
constitute a separate violation. Any constituent limit violation during the
compliance schedule period shall provide grounds for the institution of an
additional S & E program.



      3.   The city may amend an existing permit through an
enforcement schedule agreement (ESCA). This may be done after consultation
with the user, if the user has made good faith attempts to comply but
requires additional time for construction and/or acquisition of equipment
related to pretreatment. The permit may be amended with the ESCA for one
hundred eighty days; however this period may be extended for another one
hundred eighty days upon determination by the director of public works that
good cause exists.



      4.   Any other enforcement mechanism set forth in this chapter
or other applicable law may be commenced.



   C.   Continued Noncompliance After S & E Program or ESCA. If a user
remains in noncompliance because corrective action is not taken within a
reasonable time after completion of S & E program or the expiration of an
ESCA, an administrative order may be issued. Any of the other enforcement
mechanisms set forth in this chapter or applicable laws may also be
commenced. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.310  ENFORCEMENT – ASSESSMENT OF CHARGES FOR OBSTRUCTION OR DAMAGE
TO CITY FACILITIES OR OPERATIONS.



   When a user's discharge, whether due to negligence, accident, spill or
otherwise, causes an obstruction, damage or any other impairment to the
city's operation or facilities, the city may impose a charge on the user for
the cost incurred to clean or repair the facility, or to resume normal
operations assessments or penalties including any fines imposed upon the city
for violation of its discharge requirements directly resulting from the
discharge. An administrative fee of twenty-five percent of the city's costs
may be added to these charges. The total amount will be paid within
forty-five days of invoicing by the city. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.320  ENFORCEMENT – SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICE.



   A.   Suspension of Service. The city may suspend a user's wastewater
treatment service and or a wastewater discharge permit by issuance of a cease
and desist order when the city makes the determination that such suspension
is necessary in order to prevent an actual or threatened discharge, which
presents or may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of individuals or the environment, causes or may cause
interference to the treatment plant or other city operations, or causes or
may cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
Additionally, a permit may be suspended for any of the conditions set forth
in Section 13.05.230(B). Nothing in this subsection will limit the rights of
the city to suspend or terminate service to specific permit.



   Any industrial user notified of a suspension of service and/or the
wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
discharge. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with
the administrative order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary
to prevent or minimize damage to city facilities or endangerment to persons
or the environment. The city may reinstate the wastewater discharge permit,
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge.



   B.   Revocation of Permit/Termination of Permit Contract. Any user
who violates the following conditions is subject to having its permit revoked
or terminated:



      1.   Any user who knowingly gives or provides a false
statement, representation, record, report, plan, or other document to the
city or falsities, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter;



      2.   Failure of a user to factually and completely report the
wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;



      3.   Failure of a user to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;



      4.   Refusal of access to a user's premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring;



      5.   Failure of a user to notify the city immediately of an
accidental discharge and or take appropriate corrective action to prevent a
reoccurrence;



      6.   Failure of a user to file a periodic compliance report,
or the report in time and manner as required by this chapter;



      7.   Significant violations of a permit, or conditions and/or
violation of this chapter. Any violation of the discharge standards where a
constituent is determined to be five times the concentration standard or any
series of three or more violations of the same constituent within a one-year
period, shall constitute a significant violation;



      8.   Failure to pay fees and charges or penalties established
and imposed pursuant to this chapter.



   C.   Immediate Termination of Discharge. In the case of an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present an imminent and
substantial danger to health or welfare of individuals or the environment,
the city may after providing reasonable notice to the user, take all
necessary steps to halt or prevent such discharge including, but not limited
to plugging or physically disconnecting the user's access to the city
wastewater system. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.330  ENFORCEMENT – ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTIES.



   Pursuant to the authority of California Government Code Sections 54739
to 54740.6, the city or city staff may issue administrative complaints,
conduct administrative hearings, and/or impose civil penalties in accordance
with the procedures set forth in these sections for violation of the city's
requirements relating to pretreatment of industrial waste or the prevention
of the entry of industrial waste into the city's collection system or
treatment works.



   These penalties shall be as follows:



   A.   In an amount which shall not exceed two thousand dollars for
each day for failing or refusing to furnish technical or monitoring reports;



   B.   In an amount which shall not exceed three thousand dollars for
each day for failing or refusing to timely comply with a compliance schedule
established by the city;.



   C.   In an amount which shall not exceed five thousand dollars for
each day for discharges in violation of any waste discharge limitation,
permit condition, or requirement issued, or adopted by the city;



   D.   In an amount which shall not exceed ten dollars per gallon for
discharges in violation of any suspension, cease and desist order, or other
orders, or prohibition issued, reissued, or adopted by the city.



      Unless appealed, orders setting administrative civil penalties.
shall become effective and final upon issuance thereof, and payment be made
within thirty days.



      The City Attorney shall institute appropriate actions to effect
statutorily authorized remedies, upon order of the City Council . (Ord.
01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.340  ENFORCEMENT – CIVIL ACTION.



   The City Council may direct the City Attorney or other special counsel
to bring such civil actions as may be available at law or in equity in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this chapter and
to recover such charges, fees, penalties, and/or damages as may be assessed
or may be incurred under the provisions of this chapter.



   A.   Injunction. Whenever a discharge of wastewater is in violation
of the provisions of this chapter, the City Attorney may petition the
superior court for issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or
both, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such discharge.



   B.   Civil Actions for Penalties. Any user who violates any
provision of this chapter, permit condition, or who violates any cease and
desist order, prohibition, or effluent limitation, shall be liable civilly
for a penalty not to exceed twenty five thousand dollars for each day in
which such violation occurs pursuant to California Government Code Section
54740. Pursuant to the authority of the Clean Water Act 33 U.S.C.A. Section
1251 et seq. any user committing a violation of any provision of this
chapter, which is also a violation of a pretreatment standard, effluent
standard, or limitation or other applicable provision of the Clean Water Act
shall be liable civilly for a sum not to exceed twenty five thousand dollars
per violation for each day in which such violation occurs.



   C.   Other Civil Actions. The city may require compliance with
permit conditions or limitations by issuing administrative orders, including
cease and desist orders and compliance schedules. The orders are enforceable
in a California court of general jurisdiction.



The city however, may directly undertake any court action available at law or
equity, including but not limited to a civil action for penalties without
first seeking an administrative order or making use of a compliance schedule,
and it may concurrently undertake such administrative and court actions as
deemed appropriate. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.350  ENFORCEMENT – CRIMINAL ACTION.



   A.   General Criminal Penalties. Any person who violates any
provision of this chapter, or permit or who violates any administrative
order, prohibition, or effluent limitation, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction is punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or
imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Each day of violation may
constitute a new and separate offense and may subject the violator to an
additional full measure of penalties as set forth herein.



   B.   Falsifying Information. Any person who knowingly makes any
false statements, representations, or certification in any application,
record report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this chapter, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsities,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or
imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.



      Each separate act of falsification, tampering, or knowingly
rendering inaccurate shall constitute a new and separate offense and shall be
subject to the penalties contained herein. Nothing in this section is
intended to exclude the potential for prosecution under the applicable
perjury statutes of the state of California to the extent such falsification
was incorporated in a document signed under the penalty of perjury. (Ord.
01-102 § 2 (part), 2001).



13.05.360  ENFORCEMENT – NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES.



   A.   Notification To User. Whenever the city finds that any user has
violated or is violating the provisions of this chapter a wastewater
discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained
herein, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the
nature of the violation. Within thirty days of the date of this notice, a
plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation shall be submitted to
the city by the user.



   Whenever the city assesses a penalty or other form of enforcement
action under the provisions of this chapter, the city shall serve upon such
user a written notice stating the nature of the enforcement action being
taken.



   B.   Notification to City. When a user discovers that it has
violated or is violating the provision of the chapter, its wastewater
discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained
therein, including a violation as may be caused by accidental discharge or
spill, the user shall immediately notify the city upon discovery of such
violation. Within five days following the accidental discharge or spill, the
user shall immediately submit to the city a detailed written report
describing the accidental discharge or violation; and measures taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, penalty, fee or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of the violation. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.370  ENFORCEMENT – COSTS.



   All costs associated with the city's undertaking of enforcement actions
pursuant to this chapter, including attorney's fees for civil actions
undertaken, shall be paid by the user. These costs may include but are not
limited to the costs for termination of service, reinstitution of service,
compliance sampling and analysis, and administrative activities undertaken by
the city. However, if the user prevails in an appeal to the City Council or a
civil action taken to nullify an enforcement action pursued by the city under
this chapter, the user shall not be responsible for the costs incurred by the
city in pursuing the enforcement action. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.380  ENFORCEMENT – RESPONDING TO SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.



   Any violation of pretreatment standards or requirements (limits
sampling, analysis, reporting and meeting compliance schedules, and
regulatory deadlines) is an instance of noncompliance for which the
industrial user is liable for enforcement including penalties. However, the
city is required to identify violations or patterns of violations by
industrial users that are deemed to be instances of significant noncompliance
(SNC). The determination of significant noncompliance shall be used as the
basis for reporting same to the regulatory authorities and publishing the
list of significant noncompilers as is required of the city by law.



The following is a guideline of criteria, which will be used in determining
instances of SNC:



   A.   Violations of Wastewater Discharge Limits.



      1.   Chronic Violations. Chronic violations shall be deemed to
be present when sixty-six percent of the measurements exceed the daily
maximum limit or the average limit for the same parameter in a six-month
period.



      2.   Technical Review Criteria Violations. A technical review
criteria (TRC) violation occurs if thirty-three percent of the measurements
exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit by more than
the TRC in a six-month period. Such violations may be deemed significant
noncompliance. TRC is defined as 1.4 times the average or maximum limit for
the oil and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH.



      3.   Other Effluent Limit Violations. Any other violation(s)
of an effluent limit (average or daily maximum) that the city believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference (e.g.,
slug loads) or pass through (including adverse effect on any toxicity
testing); or endanger the health of treatment plant personnel or the public.



      4.   Danger to Human Health or Welfare. This category also
includes any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health/welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.



   B.   Violation of Compliance Schedule. Violations of compliance
schedule, contained in any order given to the user by the city, including the
ECSSA for starting and completing construction, attainment of final
compliance by ninety days or more after any scheduled date.



   C.   Failure to Provide Proper Data. Significant noncompliance will
also include failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self
monitoring data or categorical standards (baseline monitoring reports),
ninety-day compliance reports, and periodic reports within thirty days from
the date such reports or other data are due.



   D.   Failure to Accurately Report. Significant noncompliance status
may also be derived from the failure of the user to accurately and promptly
report any noncompliance. Any attempt to circumvent the reporting
requirements or otherwise withhold noncompliance data from the city shall
give rise to SNC status. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.390  HEARINGS AND APPEALS – AVAILABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.



   A.   Any user, permit applicant, or permit holder affected by any
decision, enforcement action, or determination made by the city, interpreting
or implementing the provisions of this chapter or in any permit issued
herein, may file with the director of public works a written request for
reconsideration of a staff decision, action or determination within fifteen
days of notification of the staff decision, action or determination. The
written request for reconsideration shall detail facts supporting the user's
request and such facts shall include a statement listing all relevant facts
which shall be considered including such facts as may not have been known or
available to the city at the date of such action. The director of public
works shall render a decision on the request for reconsideration within
fifteen days of receipt of the request, unless the director of public works
requests additional information from the city staff or the user. The director
of public works shall concur, modify or rescind the action, decision, or
determination previously made or may grant a show cause hearing regarding
such decision, action or determination. if the ruling made by the director of
public works is unacceptable, the user may within ten days after the date of
notification file a request for appeal to the City Manager, by filing the
request with the City Clerk.



   B.   A user shall not have a right to an appeal to the City Manager
unless the user has complied with the procedures concerning the request for
reconsideration by the director of public works.



   C.   When a request for appeal to the City Manager has been properly
filed with the City Clerk his or her office will schedule the matter to be
heard by the City Manager (or his or her designee) within forty-five days
from the date of the filing of the written request. The City Manager (or his
or her designee) shall make a ruling within thirty days from the date of
hearing, unless the City Manager requests additional information, from the
city staff or the user. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the statutory appeal
procedures set forth in California Government Code Section 54739, et seq.,
applicable to administrative civil penalties imposed or sought pursuant to
Section 13.05.340 of this chapter are the exclusive appeal process for such
penalties. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.400  HEARINGS AND APPEALS – SHOW CAUSE HEARINGS.



   A.   The city may order any user who violates any of the provisions
of this chapter, or permit conditions to appear before a designated hearing
officer to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be provided to the user specifying the time and place of the
hearing. A notice for a show cause hearing shall set forth the violation, the
reason why an action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and

enforcement actions or enforcement fees within that one-year period. The
deposit shall be cash or other security acceptable to the city. (Ord. 01-102
§ 2(part), 2001).



13.05.460  GREASE, OIL, SAND INTERCEPTOR PROGRAM INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.



   All nondomestic users, shall be required to install and maintain a
grease, oil and sand interceptor. It is necessary for the proper handling of
(a) liquid waste containing grease, (b) flammable wastes, (c) sand, or (d)
other harmful constituents which may be properly eliminated from the sewerage
system by the use of an interceptor or trap. Interceptor is not required for
a building used solely for residential purposes as long as there is no common
food preparation facility. Interceptor is required when the wastewater flow
from the building is anticipated to contain grease, flammable substances,
sand or other harmful ingredients in amounts or concentrations which in the
opinion of the city present the possibility of causing or contributing to the
fouling of or the blockage of or other damage to the city facilities. (Ord.
01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.470  ADMINISTRATION OF INTERCEPTOR PROGRAM.



   The city shall administer an interceptor program which is intended to
prevent grease, sand and flammable liquids, and other substances which are
likely to block or create a hazard within the city facilities from entering
the system through use of interceptors or traps. The city may require any
nondomestic user to install an interceptor or trap if the city discovers or
determines subsequent to the connection that the building facility or
operation of that user produces a waste with characteristics that would
require installation of a trap or interceptor pursuant to this chapter. The
installation of a proper interceptor or trap device shall be the
responsibility of the parcel owner and the entity which applies for the
connection or industrial user permit and the owner/proprietor of the business
or entity whose operations cause or contribute to the necessity for an
interceptor or traps. The city shall determine whether a grease trap, grease
interceptor, or other interceptor is required on a case-by-case basis based
on an evaluation of objective criteria including but not limited to factors
such as those listed below:



   A.   The type of facility (a restaurant, bakery, cheese factory,
yogurt shop, gas station, lube facility, etc.)



   B.   The volume of user's operation or business (such as meals
served, number of seats, hours of operation);



   C.   Size and nature of facilities (including kitchen facilities)
based on size, type, number of fixtures, and type of processing or cooking
equipment used;



   D.   The type of service provided or operation such as dine-in meal
service versus carry out meal service;



   E.   The type of foods or other materials used in cooking or
manufacturing operations carried on within the user's facility;



   F.   The overall potential for grease-laden, flammable, or
sand-laden discharges;



   G.   The existence of devices, procedures, or processes which are
designed to minimize the amount of grease, sand, oil, or other flammable
liquids from entering the newer system.



   The design, location and procedures for operation of a required
interceptor or trap shall be approved by the city. Such approval shall be
obtained prior to the users connection of the facility to the city sewerage
system, in the event of new construction or remodeling. In instances where a
user has already connected and the city determines that an interceptor or
trap must be installed, the user shall promptly provide for the installation
of the interceptor or trap within a reasonable time frame (as may be set by
the city), including providing such design plans and operational plans as may
be required. The installation of an interceptor or trap as required by this
chapter on an existing user facility shall occur within reasonable time not
to, exceed sixty days after the user has been provided notice of the
requirement that an interceptor or trap be installed. This sixty-day limit
may only be extended by written agreement of the city. (Ord. 01-102 § 2
(part), 2001).



13.05.480  INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AND PROGRAM.



   Any user who is required by the city and/or this chapter to install
and/or operate an interceptor or trap device, shall be required to adequately
maintain the interceptor or trap device so that such device is in proper
working order at all times. Grease and oil interceptors shall be cleaned by a
licensed and permitted waste hauler on a periodic basis so as to assure that
the interceptor will operate as designed at all times.



   Any users who are required to install or have in operation an
interceptor or traps pursuant to this chapter, shall be required to have a
plan of operation or program for their facility which is intended to ensure
that the interceptor or traps operates as designed to prevent grease, oil,
sand or other harmful constituents from entering the sewerage system. These
procedures may include adoption of kitchen practices to minimize the
grease-laden (garbage which ultimately enters the facility's drains and floor
traps and/or other such procedures as may be required for the proper
operation of the interceptors. (Ord. 01-102 § 2(part), 2001).



13.05.490  GREASE, OIL, SAND INTERCEPTOR UROCXRAM-ENFORCEMENT.



   Any user who fails to maintain an interceptor or trap pursuant to this
chapter and/or pursuant to lawful city direction, shall be subject to each of
the enforcement provisions set forth in this chapter. The enforcement
provisions of this chapter shall apply to the failure to instruct personnel,
or to maintain, pump, and/or institute a proper grease or flammable substance
reduction program. (Ord. 01-102 § 2 (part), 2001).

   A.   Every person owning, operating, leasing, occupying or renting a

conspicuous place on the premises.

underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be
done, and shall state that if the work is not completed within thirty days
after receipt of such notice, the city engineer will provide such required
underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be
assessed against the property benefitted and become a lien upon such property.



   D.   If upon the expiration of the thirty-day period, the said
required underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer
shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises
are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished
thereto, the city engineer shall, in lieu of providing the required
underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and
removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities
supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the
city engineer, he or she shall file a written report with the City Council
setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been
provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the
property against which such cost is to be assessed. The Council shall
thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of
the cost of such work upon such premises, which time shall not be less than
ten days thereafter.



   E.   The city engineer shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing
such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in
possession of such premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the owner
thereof, in the manner provided in this section for the giving of the notice
to provide that required underground facilities, of the time and place that
the Council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such
assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed
assessment.



   F.   Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the
Council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any,
and then proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.



   G.   If any assessment is not paid within five days after its
confirmation by the Council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien
upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer,
and the city engineer is directed to turn over to the county assessor and tax
collector a notice of lien on each of said properties on which the assessment
has not been paid, and the county assessor and tax collector shall add the
amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against
the premises upon which the assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be
due and payable at the same time as the property taxes are due and payable,
and if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six
percent per annum. (Ord. 264 § 10, 1969).



13.16.110  RESPONSIBILITY OF CITY.

   In the event that any act required by this chapter or by a resolution
adopted pursuant to Section 13.16.030 cannot be performed within the time

which such act will be accomplished shall be extended for a period equivalent
to the time of such limitation. (Ord. 264 § 12, 1969).

   B.   A franchise granted hereunder may be renewed upon application
by the grantee pursuant to the provisions of applicable state and federal
law. (Ord. 02-101 § 6(part), 2002)



13.18.080  FRANCHISE TERRITORY.



   Any franchise shall be valid within all the municipal limits of the

6(part), 2002)



13.18.090  FEDERAL OR STATE JURISDICTION.



   This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all

13.18.100  FRANCHISE NON-TRANSFERABLE.



   A.   Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign or dispose of
in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any of the
rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the
Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied, withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that the prior consent of the Council shall not be
required for an intra-corporate or intra-company transfer from one
wholly-owned subsidiary to another wholly-owned subsidiary. Any attempt to
sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without
the consent of the Council shall be null and void. The granting of a security
interest in any grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation or by
assignment of any right, title or interest in the cable system in order to
secure indebtedness, shall not be considered a transfer for the purposes of
this section.



   B.   The requirements of subsection (a) shall apply to any change in
control of grantee. The word “control” as used herein includes majority,
ownership, and actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In the
event that grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the Council shall be
required where ownership or control of more than twenty percent of the voting
stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in
concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of
the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively.



   C.   Grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure or
any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise

covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such
notification shall be considered by grantor as notice that a change in
control of ownership of



the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing
the consent of grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply.



   D.   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and
grantee shall assist grantor in such inquiry. In seeking grantor's consent to
any change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of
insuring that the grantee and/or the proposed transferee complete an
application in accordance with Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or
equivalent. Grantor may require grantee to submit such additional information
as the grantor may reasonably require to determine that the proposed
transferee possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications, or
that grantee is in compliance with all substantive franchise requirements. An
application shall be submitted to grantor not less than one hundred twenty
days prior to the proposed date of transfer. If the legal, technical and
financial qualifications of the applicant are determined by the grantor to be
satisfactory, and if-grantor determines that grantee is in compliance with
all substantive franchise requirements, the grantor shall consent to the
transfer of the franchise. If the grantor has not taken action on the
grantee's request for transfer within one hundred twenty days after receiving
FCC Form 394 or equivalent, grantor's consent to such transfer shall be
deemed given. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably denied or delayed. Grantor does not waive any lawful authority
it may have to impose conditions on the transfer.



   E.   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its
assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of
the franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its
designee satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the
cable system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations.
Further, said financial institution shall also agree in writing to continue
cable service and comply with all franchise requirements during the term the
financial institution exercises control over the system.



   F.   Upon transfer, grantee shall reimburse grantor for grantor's
reasonable processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of
the franchise, including without limitation, costs of administrative review,
financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee,
consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by
such experts); notice and publication costs and document preparation
expenses. Any such reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise
fee due to grantor during the term of the franchise. (Ord. 02-101 § 6(part),
2002)



13.18.110 GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE.

   B.   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any service area, grantee shall provide service to
any requesting subscriber within that service area within thirty days from
the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure all
rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such
thirty day period on reasonable terms and conditions. (Ord. 02-101 §
6(part), 2002)



13.18.120  NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.



   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive.
The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such
additional franchises for a cable system, as it deems appropriate, subject to
applicable state and federal law, provided that if the grantor grants an
additional franchise, then the material provisions of any such additional
franchise shall be reasonably comparable to the terms and conditions
contained in the initial grantee's franchise, so that all grantees are
accorded competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory treatment. (Ord. 02-101
§ 6(part), 2002)



13.18.130  MULTIPLE FRANCHISES.



   A.   Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to
applicable state or federal law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises
granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of
applicable law and specific local considerations, such as:



      1.   The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate
multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility
systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.



      2.   The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result
of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.



      3.   The disadvantages that may result from cable system
competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents'
property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the public
rights-of-way.



   B.   Where electric and telephone utilities are to be placed
underground in any new residential housing developments, grantor and the
developer of such. new residential housing shall give each grantee serving
the franchise area within which the new residential housing development is
located at least ten working days prior written notice of the date on which
open trenching will be available for the grantee's installation of conduit,
pedestals and vaults. On request of the grantor or developer, the grantee
shall provide specifications needed for trenching.



   C.   Grantor may require that any new entrant, nonincumbent grantee
be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated
therewith, if, in grantor's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any
particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables.
(Ord. 02-101 § 6(part), 2002)



13.18.140  FRANCHISE MODIFICATION.



   The grantee may be required to pay any costs incurred by the grantor in
processing a grantee request for franchise modification, lease, hypothecation
or trust of franchise. Such costs may include the costs incurred for hiring
consultants to assist in evaluating the request. Such costs shall be paid by
the grantee prior to final consideration of the request by the grantor. (Ord.

   C.   In order to determine whether sufficient telephone lines are
provided, the grantor may require upon thirty calendar days written notice,
the grantee to submit a report verifying the adequacy of its telephone line

complaint within five days of its receipt and final written response to any
unresolved complaint (other than a complaint about the carriage or the lack
of carriage of a particular programming service or about the content of a
programming service or about the level of any unregulated rate) within thirty
days of the date the complaint is made.



   Nothing in this agreement shall limit the rights of a subscriber to
initiate a court action to enforce these standards. This paragraph shall not
be interpreted to limit the rights of the city to enforce the customer
service standards.



   B.   Upon prior written request, grantor shall have the right to
review grantee's response to any subscriber complaints in order to determine
grantee's compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the
subscriber's right to privacy.



   C.   Subject to applicable law, it shall be the right of all
subscribers to continue receiving cable service insofar as their financial

shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive cable service so long
as the franchise remains in force.



   D.   In the event of a change of control of grantee, or in the event
new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with
the grantor, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to
all subscribers. During such period, grantee shall be entitled to the
revenues for any period during which it operates the system.



   E.   Grantee response to subscriber complaints, as well as
complaints made by subscribers to grantor and provided by grantor to grantee,
shall be initiated within one business day of receipt by grantee. The
resolution of subscriber complaints shall be effected by grantee not later
than three business days after receipt of the complaint. Should a grantee
supervisor not be available when requested by a subscriber, a supervisor

and in no event later than the end of the next business day. For complaints
received by grantor and provided by grantor to grantee, grantee shall notify
grantor of grantee's progress in responding to, and resolving, said
complaints. (Ord. 02-101 § 8 (part), 2002)

consecutive days other than for reasons beyond the control of grantee,
without prior approval or subsequent excuse of the grantor, the grantor may,

other demonstrative evidence which, in the reasonable judgment of the
grantor, casts reasonable doubt of the reliability or quality of cable
service to the effect that the grantee is not in  compliance with the
requirements of this chapter or its franchise, the grantor shall have the
right to compel the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of
the cable system in order to protect the public against substandard cable
service. Grantor may not compel grantee to provide such tests or reports
unless and until grantor has provided grantee with at least thirty days prior
written notice of its intention to exercise its rights under this Section
13.18.390 and has provided grantee with an opportunity to be heard prior to
its exercise of such rights. Such test or tests shall be made and the report
shall be delivered to the grantor no later than thirty days after the grantor
notifies the grantee in writing that it is exercising such right, and shall
be made at grantee's sole cost. Such report shall include the following
information: The nature of the complaints which precipitated the special
tests, what system component was tested, the equipment used and procedures
employed in said testing, the results of such tests, and the method by which
such complaints were resolved. Any other information pertinent to the special
test shall be recorded. (Ord. 02101 § 14(part), 2002).



ARTICLE XI. FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS



13.18.400  REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS.



   If grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material obligation
required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder, following
reasonable written notice from the grantor and a reasonable opportunity to
cure such nonperformance in accordance with the provisions of Article XI of
this chapter and the franchise, grantor may at its option and in its sole
discretion:



   A.   Cure the violation and recover the actual cost thereof from the
security fund established in the franchise agreement if such violation is not
cured within thirty days after written notice to the grantee of grantor's
intention to cure and draw upon the security fund;



   B.   Assess against grantee liquidated damages in an amount set
forth in the franchise agreement for any such violations(s) if such violation
is not cured, or if grantee has not commenced a cure, on a schedule
reasonably acceptable to grantor, within thirty days after written notice to
the grantee of grantor's intention to assess liquidated damages. Such
assessment may, be withdrawn from the security fund, and shall not constitute
a waiver by grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the
franchise or applicable law, including without limitation, its right to
recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses,
including actual attorney's fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by
grantor by reason of or arising out of such material breach of the franchise.
(Ord. 02-101 § 15(part), 2002).



13.18.410  PROCEDURE FOR REMEDYING FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.



   Prior to imposing any remedy or other sanction against grantee
specified in this chapter, grantor shall give grantee notice and opportunity
to be heard on the matter, in accordance with the following procedures:



   A.   Grantor shall first notify grantee of the alleged violation in
writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand
correction, or evidence of non-violation, within a reasonable time, which
shall not be less than fifteen business days in the case of the failure of
the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under this chapter
or the grantee's franchise and thirty business days in all other cases. If
grantee fails to:



      1.   Correct the alleged violation within the time prescribed;
or



      2.   Commence correction of the alleged violation within the
time prescribed and diligently remedy such alleged violation thereafter; or



      3.   Provide evidence that there is no violation, the grantor
shall then give, by personal delivery or registered or certified mail written
notice of not less than thirty days of a public hearing to be held before the
Council. Said notice shall set forth in detail each of the violations alleged
to have occurred.



   B.   Subsequent to the public hearing, the Council shall hear and
consider all other relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its
decision.



   C.   If the Council finds that:



      1.   The grantee has corrected the alleged violation; or



      2.   The grantee has diligently commenced correction of such
alleged violation after notice thereof and is diligently proceeding to fully
remedy such alleged violation; or



      3.   No material violation has occurred, the proceedings shall
terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed.



   D.   If the Council finds that material violations exist and that
grantee:



      1.   Has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner, or



      2.   Has not diligently commenced correction of such violation
after notice thereof and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such
violation; then the Council may impose one or more of the remedies provided
in this chapter and the franchise agreement as it, in its discretion, deems
appropriate under the circumstances. (Ord. 02-101 § 15(part), 2002)



13.18.420  GRANTOR'S POWER TO REVOKE.



   A.   Grantor may revoke any franchise granted pursuant to this
chapter and rescind all rights and privileges associated with it in the
following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default by grantee
and a material breach under the franchise:



      1.   If grantee fails to perform any of its material
obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement and continues such
failure to perform after receipt of due notice and a reasonable opportunity
to cure;



      2.   If grantee fails to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the insurance coverage or security fund as required in the franchise
agreement;



      3.   If grantee violates any order or ruling of any regulatory
body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the grantee's
franchise, unless such order or ruling is being contested by grantee in good
faith in an appropriate proceeding;



      4.   If grantee knowingly practices any material fraud or
deceit upon grantor,



      5.   If grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay
its debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt.



   B.   After completing the procedures set forth in Section 13.18.410
above, the grantor may make a formal request before the Council that the
grantee's franchise be revoked. The Council shall cause to be served on the
grantee written notice of its intent to consider revoking grantee's
franchise. Such notice shall be served on grantee at least sixty days prior
to the date of the hearing on the issue. The notice shall contain the time
and place of the hearing and shall be published at least once in a newspaper
of general circulation within the franchise area ten days prior to the
hearing date.



   C.   The Council shall hear any person(s) interested in the
revocation and within ninety days after the date of the hearing shall make
its determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the
grantee has committed a material breach of the franchise.



   D.   If the grantor determines that the grantee has committed a
material breach, then the grantor may:



      1.   Declare the franchise revoked and any security fund and
bonds forfeited; or



      2.   If the material breach is curable by the grantee, direct
the grantee to take appropriate remedial action within the time and manner
and under the terms and conditions reasonably specified by the grantor.



   The termination and forfeiture of the grantee's franchise shall in no
way affect any right of grantor to pursue any remedy under the franchise or
any provision of law. (Ord. 02-101 § 15(part), 2002).



13.18.430  APPEAL OF FINDING OF REVOCATION.



   The grantee may appeal a finding of revocation made pursuant to Section
13.18.420 to an appropriate court of jurisdiction, which shall have the power
to review “de novo.” Any such appeal must be initiated by, the grantee
within sixty days of the issuance of the grantor's decision to revoke the
franchise. (Ord. 02-101 § 15(part), 2002).



ARTICLE XII. FORCE MALEURE: GRANTEE'S INABILITY TO PERFORM



13.18.440  INABILITY TO PERFORM.



   In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions or
obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within grantee's control, such inability to
perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof; provided, however, that such inability to
perform shall not relieve a grantee from the obligations imposed by Section
13.18.210(c) pertaining to refunds and credits for interruptions in service.
For the purpose of this article, causes or events not within the control of
grantee shall include without limitation acts of God, war, strikes, sabotage,
riots or civil disturbances, labor disputes, restraints imposed by order of a
governmental agency or court, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural
disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires, but shall not
include financial inability of the grantee to perform or failure of the
grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental
agencies or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such
failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of grantee, or the failure of
the grantee to secure adequate personnel, supplies, services or equipment
necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable
system where the grantee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to
secure such personnel, supplies, services or equipment. (Ord. 02-101 § 16,
2002).



ARTICLE XIII. ABANDONMENT OR REMOVAL OF FRANCHISE PROPERTY



13.18.450  ABANDONMENT OR REMOVAL.



   A.   If the grantee discontinues the use of any of its property
within the public rights-of-way for a continuous period of twelve months,
such property shall be deemed to have been abandoned by grantee. Any part of
the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system
and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for the system or a part
thereof, shall not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of
use.



   B.   Grantor, upon such reasonable terms as grantor may lawfully
impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system
facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above ground
facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and
shall restore to grantor's reasonable satisfaction any affected public
right-of-way. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall
refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall
leave all public rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing
immediately prior to such removal without materially interfering with any
electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments.
Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the
public rights-of-way, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after
removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter
and the security fund as provided herein shall continue in full force and
effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by grantee with
the terms and conditions of this section.



   C.   Upon the approved abandonment of any cable system property, as
outlined in Sections 13.18.450 A. and B., the grantee, if required by the
grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument, satisfactory in form to
the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership of the abandoned cable
system property.



   D.   At the expiration, without renewal or extension, of the term
for which the franchise is granted, or upon its revocation, as provided
herein, the grantor shall have the right to require grantee to remove, at its
own expense, all above-ground portions of the cable system from all streets
and public ways within the service area within a reasonable period of time,
which shall not be less than one-hundred-eighty days.



   E.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
chapter, the grantee may abandon any underground cable system property in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the public
rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by
any public utility or other franchise holder. (Ord. 02-101 § 17(part), 2002).



13.18.460 RESTORATION BY GRANTOR REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS.



   Upon reasonable written notice and upon the failure of the grantee to
commence, pursue or complete any work to be done in any public right-of-way
required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or the franchise
agreement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of
the grantor, the grantor may cause the work to be commenced and/or completed.
The grantor shall provide to the grantee an itemized work order setting forth
in detail the exact nature of the work completed and the supplies used in
such work. The grantee shall pay to the grantor the reasonable costs for such
work no later than thirty days after receipt of the itemized work order.
(Ord. 02-101 § 17(part), 2002).



13.18.470  EXTENDED OPERATION AND CONTINUITY OF SERVICES.



   Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor shall have
the discretion to permit grantee to continue to operate the cable system for
an extended period of time. Grantee shall continue to operate the system
under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to
provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the cable services
that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers
to continue to receive all available cable services provided that financial
and other obligations to grantee are honored. The grantee shall use
reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its
subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods
following franchise expiration or termination. (Ord. 02-101 § 17 (part),
2002).



13.18.480  RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.



   A.   At the option of the grantor and subject to applicable law, a
franchise granted hereunder may be revoked one hundred twenty days after
appointment of a receiver(s) or trustee(s) to take over and conduct the
business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other action or proceeding, unless:



      1.   The receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
within said one hundred twenty days; or



      2.   Such receivers or trustees within said one-hundred-twenty
days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a
plan for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the grantor, or



      3.   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said one hundred
twenty days, have executed an agreement duly approved by the court having
jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound
by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise.



   B.   In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the
cable system, in whole or in part, the grantor may serve notice of revocation
upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, and all rights and
privileges of the grantee hereunder shall be revoked thirty days after
service of such notice, unless:



      1.   A bona fide transfer request has been submitted by
grantee for grantor review; or



      2.   Grantor shall have approved the transfer of the
franchise, the manner provided by law; and



      3.   The successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed
with grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the
franchise. (Ord. 02-101 § 17(part), 2002).



ARTICLE XIV. GRANTOR AND SUBSCRIBER RIGHTS



13.18.490  RESERVATION OF GRANTOR RIGHTS.



   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor by this
chapter, the grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is
required to be reserved by a provision of any chapter or under the franchise.
(Ord. 02-101 § 18(part), 2002).



13.18.500  WAIVER.



   A.   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by Federal or State regulation, if the
grantor determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2)
that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the
grantee or on the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be
evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized
representative of the grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall
not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be
deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement
so recites.



   B.   The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement by any failure of the
grantor on anyone or more occasions to require or seek compliance with any
such terms or conditions. (Ord. 02-101 § 18 (part), 2002).



13.18.510  NONENFORCEMENT OF GRANTOR.



   The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any
of the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement, by reason of
any failure of the grantor to enforce prompt compliance. (Ord. 02-101 §
18(part), 2002).



13.18.520  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.



   A.   Grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex or family status.
Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state
and local laws and regulations relating to nondiscrimination.



   B.   Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment
opportunity requirements of federal, state and local regulations, as now
written or as amended from time to time.



   C.   Unless directed or conducted by an authorized law enforcement
agency, which has obtained all necessary permits, neither grantee, nor any
person, or entity shall, without the subscriber's consent, tap, or arrange
for the tapping, of any cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber
outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine maintenance of the system,
detection of unauthorized service, polling with audience
approval/participation, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising
research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior and identity
cannot be identified.



   D.   In the conduct of providing its cable services or in pursuit of
any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general
citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the
system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. The
grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal
authority utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or capability,
if such equipment or capability exists, for unauthorized personal
surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen.



   E.   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of
equipment owned by grantee shall be installed by grantee in the subscriber's
premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any
required consent if a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon
subscriber's property shall be deemed granted.



   F.   The grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not sell,
or otherwise make available to any party without consent of the subscriber
pursuant to state and federal privacy laws:



      1.   Any list of the names and addresses of subscribers
containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request to be removed
from such list; and



      2.   Any list which identifies the viewing habits of
individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such
subscribers. This does not prohibit the grantee from providing composite
ratings of subscriber viewing to any party. (Ord. 02-101 § 18(part), 2002).

available to all residents of the city on a nondiscriminatory, first-come,

ARTICLE XVI. STATE VIDEO SERVICE FRANCHISES



13.18.560  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   A.   Purpose.  This article is intended to be applicable to state
franchise holders who have been awarded a state video franchise under the
California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq. (the Digital
Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 [“DIVCA”]), to serve any
location(s) within the incorporated boundaries of the city.  It is the
purpose of this article to implement within the incorporated boundaries of
the city the provisions of DIVCA and the rules of the California Public
Utilities Commission promulgated there under that are applicable to a
“local franchising entity” or a “local entity” as defined in DIVCA.



   B.   Rights reserved.



      1.   The rights reserved to the city under this article are in
addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or
authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall
affect any other rights which may be held by the city.



      2.   Except as otherwise provided by DIVCA, a state franchise
shall not include, or be a substitute for:



         a.   Compliance with generally applicable requirements
for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the city,
including, but not limited to, compliance with the conditions that the city
may establish before facilities may be constructed for, or providing,
non-video services;



         b.   Any permit or authorization required in connection
with operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including,
but not limited to, encroachment permits, street work permits, pole
attachment permits and street cut permits; and



         c.   Any permit, agreement or authorization for
occupying any other property of the city or any private person to which
access is not specifically granted by the state franchise.



      3.   Except as otherwise provided in DIVCA, a state franchise
shall not relieve a state franchise holder of its duty to comply with all
laws, including the ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations, and other
laws of the city, and every state franchise holder shall comply with the same.



      4.    No permit issued by the city to a state franchise holder
is itself a franchise, nor shall any permit create a vested right that would
prohibit the city from revoking or amending the permit. 



   C.   Compliance with city ordinances.  Nothing contained in this
Article shall ever be construed so as to exempt a state franchise holder from
compliance with all ordinances, rules or regulations of the city now in
effect or which may be hereafter adopted which are consistent with this
Article or California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq.

California Public Utilities Code, state franchise holders shall ensure that
all PEG channels are receivable by all subscribers, whether they receive
digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any
equipment other than that needed to receive the lowest cost tier of
service.  PEG access capacity provided by a state franchise holder shall be
of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels
(unless the PEG signal is provided to the state franchise holder at a lower
quality or with less functionality), shall be capable of carrying a National
Television System Committee (NTSC) television signal, and shall be carried on
the state franchise holder's lowest cost tier of service.  To the extent
feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other
channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers
for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent
cable operator, unless prohibited by federal law.  After the initial
designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be
changed without the agreement of the City unless federal law requires the
change.



      2.   As set forth in Section 5870(h) of the California Public
Utilities Code, the holder of a state franchise and an incumbent cable
operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the

agreement for PEG carriage, the city shall require the incumbent cable
operator to allow the state franchise holder to interconnect its network with
the incumbent cable operator's network at a technically feasible point on the
state franchise holder's network as identified by the state franchise
holder.  If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available,
the state franchise holder shall make interconnection available to each PEG
channel originator programming a channel in the city and shall provide the
facilities necessary for the interconnection.  The cost of any
interconnection shall be borne by the state franchise holder requesting the
interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

for any material breach by a holder of a state franchise.  Prior to
assessing penalties for a material breach, the City Manager shall first have
provided the state franchise holder with written notice of any alleged
material breach of the customer service provisions set forth in California
Public Utilities Code Section 5900 and shall allow the state franchise holder
at least thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to remedy the specified
material breach.  If the material breach has not been remedied upon the

title to the house, building, property or other structure served.  A
transfer of ownership between family members or into a revocable or
irrevocable living trust does not require testing if reassessment of property
value is not required by the Contra Costa County Tax Assessor.

13.20.060  COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS - 10 YEAR INSPECTION REQUIREMENT.



   The homeowners' association of a common interest development in which
several individually-owned units share common sewer laterals shall provide
the city with inspection verification of all privately owned building sewer
laterals within the common interest areas at least once every ten (10) years
for compliance with the duties and obligations imposed by this chapter.  If
no homeowners' association exists, then the individual unit owners, both
jointly and individually, shall be liable for the duties and obligations with
respect to building sewer laterals as established by the Pinole Municipal
Code.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.070  INSPECTION PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA.



   A.   Inspection procedures.



      1.   The inspection shall be conducted by a licensed
contractor qualified to provide video inspections.  The contractor must have
both a city of Pinole business license and a State of California contractor's
license.  The Department of Public Works will maintain a list of contractors
on file at City Hall.



      2.   All building sewer laterals shall be inspected by video.



      3.   The property owner shall submit a video recording of the
building sewer lateral inspection to the Department of Public Works for
review along with the designated Inspection fee.  At the beginning of such
video, the qualified contractor shall state the address of the property and
take a photograph of the home that the property owner shall submit to the
Department of Public Works with the video.



      4.   The property owner or an agent for the property owner
shall notify the city of the time and date of the Inspection at least seven
(7) calendar days prior to the inspection.



      5.   Prior to testing, the building sewer lateral shall be
thoroughly cleaned.



      6.   An inspection shall be valid for a period of six (6)
months from the date of the Inspection.  If a property owner fails to obtain
a certificate of compliance within six (6) months after obtaining an
Inspection, the Department of Public Works may, in its discretion, require
the property owner to obtain another inspection before issuing a certificate
of compliance.



   B.   Inspection criteria.  A property complies with the provisions
of this section if the inspection verifies all of the following conditions as
approved by the Director of Public Works:



      1.   The building sewer lateral is free of roots, grease
deposits, and other solids which may impede or obstruct the transmission of
sewage.



      2.   There are no improper or illegal connections to the
building sewer lateral such as sump pumps, down spouts or area drainage
facilities.



      3.   All joints in the building sewer lateral are tight and
sound to prevent the exfiltration of sewage and the infiltration of
groundwater, storm water and/or rain water.



      4.   The building sewer lateral is free of structural defects,
cracks, breaks, or missing portions and the grade is reasonably uniform
without major sags or offsets.



      5.   The building sewer lateral is equipped with at least one
(1) clean-out located within five (5) feet of the building footprint and with
a backflow prevention device as required by Section 13.20.030.



      6.   None of the other defective conditions referred to in
Section 13.20.040 exist on the property.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.080  MITIGATION OF FAILED TEST OR INSPECTION.



   A.   Notice and repair.  When the Director of Public Works
determines, in his or her discretion, that a building sewer lateral is in a
defective condition, the city shall provide a written notice of violation
that meets the criteria in Section 13.20.140.  The property owner shall
cause all repairs necessary to bring the building sewer lateral into
compliance.  All costs of repair or replacement of the building sewer
lateral shall be borne by the property owner.



   B.   Additional inspection.  Upon completion of repairs to or
replacement of the building sewer lateral, the property owner shall have
another inspection conducted in order to verify that the repairs or
replacement have been properly completed, pursuant to Section 13.20.070.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.090  REPAIR OF BUILDING SEWER LATERAL - EXTENSION OF TIME FOR PROBATE
PROCEEDINGS.



   A.   Probate and testamentary proceedings.  For properties sold or
transferred in a probate or other testamentary proceeding, pursuant to the
termination of a joint tenancy or similar proceeding, any repair or
replacement of a building sewer lateral shall be completed within ninety (90)
days after the probate sale or other transfer.  If repair or replacement
does not occur within ninety (90) days after probate sale or transfer, the
requirement to comply with this chapter becomes an obligation of the new
property owner.  The Public Works Director may provide additional extensions
of time in writing.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.100  RIGHT OF ENTRY.



   As a condition of receipt of city sewer services and use of the public
sewer, the Public Works Director, or his or her designee, may enter, conduct
an inspection, collect wastewater samples, and test any building sewer
lateral, building, structure, or premise to secure compliance or prevent a
violation of this chapter.  Unless there is an emergency threatening the
public health, safety or welfare, the Public Works Director shall provide at
least three (3) business days' notice to the property owner and/or tenant of
intent to enter upon property.  The Public Works Director may also request
that a property owner provide all written records of inspection, maintenance,
repair and replacement at the time of inspection of the building sewer
lateral or within ten (10) or more business days after receipt of the request.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.110  BUILDING SEWER LATERAL COMPLIANCE AND ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF
COMPLIANCE.



   The city shall review the final submitted Inspection for compliance
with this chapter.  When all conditions are met to the satisfaction of the
city, the building sewer lateral shall be certified as complying with the
provisions of the Pinole Municipal Code.  The city shall thereupon issue a
certificate of compliance to the property owner, noting that the building
sewer lateral serving the property is properly equipped, structurally sound
and meets the requirements of the city.  Once a certificate of compliance is
issued, the building sewer lateral for which the certificate of compliance is
issued shall not require testing for a period of ten (10) years from the date
of issuance of the certificate of compliance unless the city has reason to
believe the building sewer lateral is in a defective condition.  The
certificate of compliance shall not imply a warranty or guarantee of any kind.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.120  HARDSHIP DEFERRALS FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT.



   A.   In the event that the property owner establishes to the
satisfaction of the city that repair or replacement of a building sewer
lateral before the close of escrow in a non-probate sale will result in undue
hardship inconsistent with the purpose or intent of this chapter, a written
request for hardship status may be submitted to the Public Works Director. 
The Public Works Director shall make a hardship finding only if the
requesting property owner presents written facts that clearly demonstrate (in
the Public Works Director's sole discretion) that the property owner's
payment for and completion of a building sewer lateral repair or replacement
at the required time would result in an undue hardship.  If hardship status
is granted, the property owner who is selling the property, or the purchaser
of such property may request the city to defer the building sewer lateral
repair up to one hundred and eighty (180) days.



   B.   For purposes of this section, UNDUE HARDSHIP shall be defined
as:



      1.   The severe illness or incapacitation of the property
owner;



      2.   The immediate transfer or removal of the property owner
from the state, thereby making the hiring of a contractor to repair or
replace the building sewer lateral impractical or overly burdensome; or



      3.   Any physical or financial situation that would render
compliance with the time limits for the repair or replacement of building
sewer lateral extraordinarily difficult or impractical.



The property owner shall bear the burden of submitting documentation and
proving the existence of such a bona fide hardship to the satisfaction of the
Public Works Director.



   C.   Any property owner to whom a hardship finding is granted shall
be given written notice of the finding.  Said notice shall inform the
property owner that the building sewer lateral repair or replacement
requirement is only deferred up to one hundred eighty (180) days.  A copy of
the notice shall be sent to both the property owner and, if applicable, the
purchaser of the property.



   D.   In the event of a failure to comply with this chapter within
the allotted time, the city may bring an enforcement action and exercise any
other remedy provided by the Municipal Code and/or applicable law against the
property owner and any other responsible party.  In addition thereto, any
property owner who fails to fully comply with this chapter shall be
responsible for all damages that arise from or relate to such failure.  For
purposes of this section, DAMAGES include all compensatory damages, fines,
penalties, assessments, attorneys fees, costs and other monetary exactions
that may be awarded to, levied or assessed by any person, firm, corporation,
company or public entity.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.130  NOTICES TO CORRECT VIOLATIONS.



   If the Public Works Director receives notice that a building sewer
lateral does not or may not meet the standards set forth in this chapter and
the property owner does not agree in writing to perform the repairs or
replacements necessary to bring the building sewer lateral into compliance,
then the Public Works Director shall give written notice of violation to the
property owner of any conditions that violate this chapter.  Such notice
shall be provided using first class U.S. mail and shall specify the repair or
replacement necessary to correct the condition and the time in which to make
the correction, and shall advise the property owner of the enforcement
provisions of this chapter.  If the repairs are not completed within the
time allowed by the city, or if the city determines that the property may be
transferred before the required testing or repairs can be completed, the city
shall record a notice of violation in the official records of Contra Costa
County specifying the nature of the violation and the action needed to
correct it.  The notice shall only be rescinded when the building sewer
lateral serving such property has been repaired or replaced to the
satisfaction of the city.  Recording a notice of violation is in addition to
all other remedies available to the city.



(Ord. 2012-02 § 1 (part), 2012)



13.20.140  COORDINATION OF LATERAL REPAIRS WITH CITY UTILITY AND STREET
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.



   A.   If a building sewer lateral otherwise needs repair or
replacement, the property owner repairing or replacing the building sewer
lateral shall comply with all requirements of this chapter and any other
requirements imposed by the city to repair or replace the paving on the
public right-of-way.  The city may require (at the sole discretion of the
city) that a certified paving contractor complete the necessary paving.



   B.   Whenever the city plans a project to maintain, repair or
replace a public sewer that involves excavation of a street or a street
improvement project, the city shall notify all property owners whose building
sewer laterals connect to that public sewer main where the project is to be
performed.  The city shall work with interested property owners to develop a
comprehensive program for repair or replacement of building sewer laterals
needing replacement at the same time the city's project is performed.

13.20.160  NUISANCE.



   Any building sewer lateral or appurtenance thereto that is in violation
of this chapter is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance and
subject to abatement pursuant to Chapters 1.12 and 8.24 of the Pinole
Municipal Code, and as currently in effect or as hereafter amended.  Such
nuisance conditions include, but are not limited to, any defective sewer
lateral, any building sewer lateral with or sewer clean-outs which contain
leaks or breaks; any building sewer lateral to which a clean-out and a
backflow prevention device is not properly attached or properly functioning;

bid, awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.  A contract may include work

Council will hear it and any objections of any of the property owners liable
to be assessed for the work of abatement. Thereupon, by motion or resolution

ARTICLE I. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS



15.48.010  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code
Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the city
of Pinole does ordain as follows in this chapter. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A)
(part), 1988).



15.48.020  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.



   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights
and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas.
Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 511 § 2 (Exh. A)
(part), 1988).



15.48.030  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:



   A.   To protect human life and health;



   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;

ARTICLE III. GENERAL PROVISIONS



15.48.070  LANDS TO WHICH THIS ORDINANCE APPLIES.



   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards and
areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards within the jurisdiction of the
city. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.080  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.



   The areas of special flood hazard  identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA)  in the “Flood Insurance Study for City of
Pinole,” dated February 1980, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are  hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This Flood Insurance
Study is on file at 2131-Pear Street, Pinole, California. This Flood
Insurance Study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may
be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this
chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the Floodplain
Administrator. (Ord. 2009-02 § 2, 2009; Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.090  COMPLIANCE.



   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this
chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the
City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.100  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.110  INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions
shall be:



   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;



   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.120  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.130  SEVERABILITY.



   This ordinance and the various parts thereof are declared to be
severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so
declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part),
1988).



ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION



15.48.140  ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.



   A development permit shall be obtained before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazards established in
Section 15.48.080. Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the  Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be
limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location
of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:



   A.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement) of all structures.



   B.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
structure will be floodproofed.



   C.   All appropriate certifications listed in Section 15.48.160 of
this chapter.



   D.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 2009-02 § 3,
2009; Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.150  DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.



   The  Public Works Director/City Engineer is hereby appointed to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development
permits in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 2009-02 § 4, 2009; Ord. 511
§ 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1988).



15.48.160  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.



   The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall
include, but not be limited to:



   A.   Permit Review.



      1.   Review all development permits to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.



      2.   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained.



      3.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding.



      4.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the
carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined
but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter,
“adversely affects.  that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point.



   B.   Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data
has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.48.080, the floodplain
administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source,
in order to administer Article V of this chapter. Any such information shall
be submitted to the City Council for adoption.



   C.   Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated:



      1.   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department
of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration.



      2.   Require that the flood carrying capacity of the altered
or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.



      3.   Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations:



         a.   Within six (6) months of information becoming
available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain
Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits
technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).



         b.   All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved
prior to the issuance of building permits.  Building Permits must not be
issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's).  Approved
CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.



   Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those
physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements are based on current data.



   4.   Changes in corporate boundaries.  Notify FEMA in writing
whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other
means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the
new corporate limits.



   D.   Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as
needed:



      1.   The certification required in Section 15.48.170(C)(1)
(floor elevations);



      2.   The certification required in Section 15.48.170(C)(2)(c)
(elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);



      3.   The certification required in Sections 15.48.170(C)(3)(a)
or 15.48.170 (C) (3) (b) (wet floodproofing standard);



      4.   The certified elevation required in Section 15.48.190(B)
(subdivision standards);



      5.   The certification required in Section 15.48.210(A)
(floodway encroachments);



      6.   The information required in Section 15.48.220 (coastal
construction standards).



   E.   Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Article VI of this chapter.



   F.   Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified
in Section 15.48.090 herein.



(Ord. 2009-02 § 5, 2009; Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part), 1988).



ARTICLE V. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION



15.48.170  STANDARDS OF CONSTRUCTION.



   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are
required:



   A.   Anchoring.



   1.   All new construction and substantial improvement shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.



      2.   All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards
of Section 15.48.200.



   B.   Construction Materials and Methods.

be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.



      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.



      3.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.



   C.   Elevation and Floodproofing.



      1.   New construction and substantial improvement of any
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the
standards in Section 15.48.170(C)(2). Upon the completion of the structure
the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community
building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or
verification shall be provided to the  Floodplain Administrator.



      2.   Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in
conformance with Section 15.48.170 (C) (1) or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:

the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;



         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;



         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certifications shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



      3.   Require, for all new construction and substantial

15.48.230  APPEAL BOARD.



   A.   The City Council of the city of Pinole shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.



   B.   The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the floodplain administrator in the



enforcement or administration of this chapter.



   C.   In passing upon such applications, the City Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:



      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;



      2.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage;



      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;



      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;



      5.   The necessity of the facility of a waterfront location,
where applicable;



      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;



      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;



      9.   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise,

substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in subsection C (1
through 11) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.



   E.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this
section and the purposes of this chapter the City Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.



   F.   The  Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of
all appeal actions and report any variances to the  Federal Emergency
Management Agency . (Ord. 2009-02 § 6, 2009; Ord. 511 § 2(Exh. A) (part),

Places of the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the
procedure set forth in the remainder of this section.



   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.



   C.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.



   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon:



      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



      2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional-hardship to the applicant;



      3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of, the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.



   E.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A
through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the
base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.



   F.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice  over the signature of a community official that (1) the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as
high as twenty-five dollars ($25) for one hundred dollars ($100) of insurance
coverage, and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall
be recorded by the  Floodplain Board in the office of the Contra Costa
County  Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the
chain of title of the affected parcel of land. (Ord. 2009-02 § 9, 2009; Ord.

and



      2.   A water budget calculation for the landscape project. For
the calculation of the Maximum Applied Water Allowance and Estimated Total
Water Use, a project applicant shall use the ETo value of 41.8.



   B.   Water budget calculations shall adhere to the following
requirements:



      1.   The plant factor used shall be from WUCOLS. The plant
factor ranges from 0 to 0.3 for low water use plants, from 0.4 to 0.6 for

Allowance shall be calculated using the equation:



   MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)]



   The example calculations below are hypothetical to demonstrate proper
use of the equations and do not represent an existing and/or planned
landscape project in the City of Pinole. The ETo values used in these
calculations are from the Reference Evapotranspiration Table in Appendix A,
for planning purposes only. For actual irrigation scheduling, automatic
irrigation controllers are required and shall use current reference
evapotranspiration data, such as from the California Irrigation Management
Information System (CIMIS), other equivalent data, or soil moisture sensor
data.



      1.   Example MAWA calculation: a hypothetical landscape
project in Fresno, CA with an irrigated landscape area of fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet without any Special Landscape Area (SLA= 0, no edible
plants, recreational areas, or use of recycled water). To calculate MAWA, the
annual reference evapotranspiration value used is 51.1 inches as listed in
the Reference Evapotranspiration Table in Appendix A.



      MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)]



      MAWA = Maximum Applied Water Allowance (gallons per year)



      ETo = Reference Evapotranspiration (inches per year)



      0.62 = Conversion Factor (to gallons)



      0.7 = ET Adjustment Factor (ETAF)



      LA = Landscape Area including SLA (square feet)



      0.3 = Additional Water Allowance for SLA



      SLA = Special Landscape Area (square feet)



      MAWA = (51.1 inches) (0.62) [(0.7 x 50,000 square feet) + (0.3 x
0)]



      = 1,108,870 gallons per year



      To convert from gallons per year to hundred-cubic-feet per year:



      = 1,108,870/748 = 1,482 hundred-cubic-feet per year



      (100 cubic feet = 748 gallons)



      2.   In this next hypothetical example, the landscape project
that has the same ETo value of 51.1 inches and a total landscape area of
fifty thousand (50,000) square feet. Within the fifty thousand (50,000)
square foot project, there is now a two thousand (2,000) square foot area
planted with edible plants. This two thousand (2,000) square foot area is
considered to be a Special Landscape Area.



      MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)]



      MAWA = (51.1 inches) (0.62) [(0.7 x 50,000 square feet) + (0.3 x
2,000 square feet)]



      = 31.68 x [35,000 + 600] gallons per year



      = 31.68 x 35,600 gallons per year



      =1,127,808 gallons per year or 1,508 hundred-cubic-feet per year



         a.   Estimated Total Water Use. The Estimated Total
Water Use shall be calculated using the equation below. The sum of the
Estimated Total Water Use calculated for all hydrozones shall not exceed MAWA.









 



Where:



   ETWU = Estimated Total Water Use per year (gallons)



   ETo = Reference Evapotranspiration (inches)



   PF = Plant Factor from WUCOLS (see Section 491)



   HA = Hydrozone Area [high, medium, and low water use areas] (square
feet)



   SLA = Special Landscape Area (square feet)



   0.62 = Conversion Factor



   IE = Irrigation Efficiency (minimum 0.71)



      (1)   Example ETWU calculation: landscape area is fifty
thousand (50,000) square feet; plant water use type, plant factor, and
hydrozone area are shown in the table below. The ETo value is 51.1 inches per
year. There are no Special Landscape Areas (recreational area, area
permanently and solely dedicated to edible plants, and area irrigated with
recycled water) in this example.

gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,108,870 gallons per year). In this
example, the water budget complies with the MAWA.



      (2)   Example ETWU calculation: total landscape area is fifty
thousand (50,000) square feet, two thousand (2,000) square feet of which is
planted with edible plants. The edible plant area is considered a Special
Landscape Area (SLA). The reference evapotranspiration value is 51.1 inches
per year. The plant type, plant factor, and hydrozone area are shown in the

use, with the exception of hydrozones with plants of mixed water use, as
specified in Section 15.54.028 (a)(2)(D).



   C.   Plants shall be selected and planted appropriately based upon
their adaptability to the climatic, geologic, and topographical conditions of
the project site. To encourage the efficient use of water, the following is
highly recommended:



      1.   Use the Sunset Western Climate Zone System which takes
into account temperature, humidity, elevation, terrain, latitude, and varying
degrees of continental and marine influence on local climate;



      2.   Recognize the horticultural attributes of plants (i.e.,
mature plant size, invasive surface roots) to minimize damage to property or
infrastructure [e.g., buildings, sidewalks, power lines]; and



      3.   Consider the solar orientation for plant placement to
maximize summer shade and winter solar gain.



   D.   Turf is not allowed on slopes greater than twenty-five percent
(25%) where the toe of the slope is adjacent to an impermeable hardscape and
where twenty-five percent (25%) means one (1) foot of vertical elevation
change for every four (4) feet of horizontal length (rise divided by run x
one hundred (100) = slope percent).



   E.   A landscape design plan for projects in fire-prone areas shall
address fire safety and prevention. A defensible space or zone around a
building or structure is required per Public Resources Code Section 4291(a)

discouraged.



   G.   The architectural guidelines of a common interest development,
which include community apartment projects, condominiums, planned
developments, and stock cooperatives, shall not prohibit or include
conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of low-water use
plants as a group.



   H.   Water Features.



      1.   Recirculating water systems shall be used for water
features.



      2.   Where available, recycled water shall be used as a source
for decorative water features.



      3.   Surface area of a water feature shall be included in the
high water use hydrozone area of the water budget calculation.



      4.   Pool and spa covers are highly recommended.



   I.   Mulch and Amendments.



      1.   A minimum two (2) inch layer of mulch shall be applied on
all exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping or
rooting groundcovers, or direct seeding applications where mulch is
contraindicated.



      2.   Stabilizing mulching products shall be used on slopes.



      3.   The mulching portion of the seed/mulch slurry in
hydro-seeded applications shall meet the mulching requirement.



      4.   Soil amendments shall be incorporated according to
recommendations of the soil report and what is appropriate for the plants
selected (see Section 15.54.024).



   J.   The landscape design plan, at a minimum, shall have the
following:



      1.   Delineate and label each hydrozone by number, letter, or
other method;



      2.   Identify each hydrozone as low, moderate, high water, or
mixed water use. Temporarily irrigated areas of the landscape shall be
included in the low water use hydrozone for the water budget calculation;



      3.   Identify recreational areas;



      4.   Identify areas permanently and solely dedicated to edible
plants;

      7.   Identify soil amendments, type, and quantity;



      8.   Identify type and surface area of water features;



      9.   Identify hardscapes (pervious and non-pervious);



      10.   Identify location and installation details of any
applicable stormwater best management practices that encourage on-site
retention and infiltration of stormwater. Stormwater best management
practices are encouraged in the landscape design plan and examples include,
but are not limited to:



         a.   Infiltration beds, swales, and basins that allow
water to collect and soak into the ground;



         b.   Constructed wetlands and retention ponds that
retain water, handle excess flow, and filter pollutants; and



         c.   Pervious or porous surfaces (e.g., permeable pavers

licensed landscape contractor, or any other person authorized to design a
landscape. (See Sections 5500.1, 5615, 5641, 5641.1, 5641.2, 5641.3, 5641.4,
5641.5, 5641.6, 6701, 7027.5 of the Business and Professions Code, Section
832.27 of Title16 of the California Code of Regulations, and Section 6721 of
the Food and Agriculture Code.)  (Ord. 2009-11 § 1(part), 2009).



15.54.028  IRRIGATION DESIGN PLAN.



   A.   For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system shall meet
all the requirements listed in this section and the manufacturers'
recommendations. The irrigation system and its related components shall be
planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and
maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria
shall be submitted as part of the Landscape Documentation Package.



      1.   System.



         a.   Dedicated landscape water meters are highly
recommended on landscape areas smaller than five thousand (5,000) square feet
to facilitate water management.



         b.   Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either
evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data shall be required for
irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.



         c.   The irrigation system shall be designed to ensure
that the dynamic pressure at each emission device is within the
manufacturer's recommended pressure range for optimal performance.



            i.   If the static pressure is above or below the
required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating
devices such as inline pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices
shall be installed to meet the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation
system.



            ii.   Static water pressure, dynamic or operating
pressure and flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point
of connection. These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the
design stage. If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the
measurements shall be conducted at installation.



   B.   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or
auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable
weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as
appropriate for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided
during windy or freezing weather or during rain.



   C.   Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or
butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of
connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an
emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair.



   D.   Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the
water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant
shall refer to the applicable local agency code (i.e., public health) for
additional backflow prevention requirements.



   E.   High flow sensors that detect and report high flow conditions
created by system damage or malfunction are recommended.



   F.   The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low
head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water
flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, nonirrigated areas,
hardscapes, roadways, or structures.



   G.   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as
soil type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation
systems.



   H.   The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the
hydrozones of the landscape design plan.



   I.   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet,
at a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria as described in Section
15.54.022 regarding the Maximum Applied Water Allowance.



   J.   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local
agency inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating
demands (on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact
the effectiveness of the irrigation system.



   K.   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.



   L.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's
recommendations.



   M.   Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler
spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution
uniformity using the manufacturer's recommendations.



   N.   Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required
on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to high traffic areas.



   O.   Check valves or anti-drain valves are required for all
irrigation systems.



   P.   Narrow or irregularly shaped areas, including turf, less than
eight (8) feet in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface
irrigation or low volume irrigation system.



   Q.   Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four
(24) inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the
setback from non-permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low
flow non-spray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The
surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material.
These restrictions may be modified if:



      1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and
no runoff occurs; or



      2.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or



      3.   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design
or technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation Package and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in Section
15.54.028 (a)(1)(H). Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed
during the irrigation audit.



   R.   Slopes greater than twenty-five percent (25%) shall not be
irrigated with an irrigation system with a precipitation rate exceeding 0.75
inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer
specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the Landscape
Documentation Package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will
occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the
irrigation audit.



   S.   Hydrozone.



      1.   Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site,
slope, sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water
use.



      2.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be
selected based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that
hydrozone.



      3.   Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves
from shrubs, groundcovers, and turf.



      4.   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low
water use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:



         a.   Plant factor calculation is based on the
proportions of the respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or



         b.   The plant factor of the higher water using plant is
used for calculations.



   T.   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants
shall not be permitted.



   U.   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation.
On the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve,
and assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the Hydrozone
Information Table (see Appendix B Section A). This table can also assist with
the irrigation audit and programming the controller.



      1.   The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain:



         a.   Location and size of separate water meters for
landscape;



         b.   Location, type and size of all components of the
irrigation system, including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves,
sprinkler heads, moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers,
pressure regulators, and backflow prevention devices;



         c.   Static water pressure at the point of connection to
the public water supply;



         d.   Flow rate (gallons per minute), application rate
(inches per hour), and design operating pressure (pressure per square inch)

Code of Regulations, and Section 6721 of the Food and Agricultural Code.) 
(Ord. 2009-11 § 1(part), 2009).



15.54.030  GRADING DESIGN PLAN.



   A.   For the efficient use of water, grading of a project site shall
be designed to minimize soil erosion, runoff, and water waste. A grading plan
shall be submitted as part of the Landscape Documentation Package. A
comprehensive grading plan prepared by a civil engineer for other local
agency permits satisfies this requirement.

15.54.034 IRRIGATION SCHEDULING.



   A.   For the efficient use of water, all irrigation schedules shall
be developed, managed, and evaluated to utilize the minimum amount of water
required to maintain plant health. Irrigation schedules shall meet the
following criteria:



      1.   Irrigation scheduling shall be regulated by automatic
irrigation controllers.



      2.   Overhead irrigation shall be scheduled between 8:00 p.m.
and 10:00 a.m. unless weather conditions prevent it. If allowable hours of

shall apply. Operation of the irrigation system outside the normal watering
window is allowed for auditing and system maintenance.



      3.   For implementation of the irrigation schedule, particular
attention must be paid to irrigation run times, emission device, flow rate,
and current reference evapotranspiration, so that applied water meets the
Estimated Total Water Use. Total annual applied water shall be less than or
equal to Maximum Applied Water Allowance (MAWA). Actual irrigation schedules
shall be regulated by automatic irrigation controllers using current
reference evapotranspiration data (e.g., CIMIS) or soil moisture sensor data.

         b.   The established landscape; and



         c.   Temporarily irrigated areas.



      5.   Each irrigation schedule shall consider for each station
all of the following that apply:



         a.   Irrigation interval (days between irrigation);



         b.   Irrigation run times (hours or minutes per
irrigation event to avoid runoff);



         c.   Number of cycle starts required for each irrigation
event to avoid runoff;



         d.   Amount of applied water scheduled to be applied on

   Prior to the filing of the final map with the governing body, the
subdivider shall file with the clerk of the board of supervisors of the
county in which any part of the subdivision is located, a certificate from
the official computing redemptions in Contra Costa County and the city of
Pinole, showing that according to the records of his or her office, there are
no liens against the subdivision or any part thereof for unpaid state,
county, municipal, or local taxes, or special assessments collected as taxes,
except taxes or special assessments not yet payable. As to taxes or special
assessments collected as taxes not yet payable, the subdivider shall file
with the clerk of the board of supervisors, a certificate by each proper
officer giving his or her estimate of the amount of taxes and assessments
which are a lien but which are not yet payable. (Ord. 89 § 4.4, 1955).

map shall not be recorded until the owner or subdivider executes and files
with the board of supervisors of the county wherein any part of the
subdivision is located a good and sufficient bond to be approved by the board
and by its terms inure to the benefit of the county and conditioned upon the
payment of all state, county, municipal, and local taxes and all special
assessments collected as taxes, which, at the time the final map is recorded,
are a lien against the property, but which are not yet payable. In lieu of a
bond, a deposit may be made of money or negotiable bonds in the same amount,
and of the kind approved for securing deposits of public money. (Ord. 89 §
4.5, 1955).



16.16.120  APPROVAL BY CITY ENGINEER.



   Upon receipt of the final map and other data submitted therewith by the
planning commission, the map and data shall be referred to the city engineer
who shall examine such to determine that the subdivision as shown is
substantially the same as it appeared on the tentative map, and any approved
alterations thereof, that all provisions of the law and of this chapter
applicable at the time of approval of the tentative map have been complied
with, and that he or she is satisfied that the map is technically correct. If
the city engineer shall determine that full conformity therewith has not been
made, he or she shall advise the subdivider of the changes or additions that
must be made for such purposes, and shall afford the subdivider an
opportunity to make such changes or additions. if the city engineer shall
determine that full conformity therewith has been made, he or she shall so
certify on said map and shall transmit the map to the planning commission. In
the event a sub-division is partly in the city and partly outside the city,
the county surveyor and the city engineer shall enter into an agreement by
and with the consent of their respective governing bodies, providing that the
county surveyor when by such agreement all such duties devolve upon him or
her, may, after his or her performance thereof, make the aforesaid
certification upon the map, and, when by such agreement the duties are
apportioned between the county surveyor and city engineer, it shall be
sufficient, if each shall after the performance thereof, make a certification
on the map, showing the duties performed by each, after which the map shall
be transmitted to the planning commission. (Ord. 89 § 4.6(a), 1955).



16.16.130  APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.



   Upon return of the final map by the city engineer or county surveyor,
the planning commission shall examine the same to determine whether the map
conforms with the tentative map and with all changes permitted and all
requirements imposed as a condition to its acceptance. If the planning
commission shall determine not to recommend the map, it shall advise the
subdivider of the changes or additions that must be made for such purpose,
and shall accord him or her an opportunity to make same. If the planning
commission shall thereupon determine that the map is in conformity therewith,
it shall certify its approval thereon and shall transmit the map to the City
Clerk, together with any documents which may have been filed therewith for
presentation to the City Council. (Ord. 89 § 4.6(b), 1955).



16.16.140  APPROVAL BY CITY COUNCIL.



   At its first regular meeting following the filing of the map with the
City Clerk, or within ten days following the filing thereof, the City Council
shall consider the map, the plan of subdivision and the offers of dedication.
The City Council may reject any or all offers of dedication. If the City
Council shall determine that the map is in conformity with the requirements
of this chapter and that it is satisfied with the plan of subdivision, it
shall approve the map. When the subdivider shall have filed with the City
Clerk the agreement and bond, or made the deposit described in Section
16.16.150, and when such agreement and bond shall have been approved by the
City Attorney, as to form, and by the city engineer as to sufficiency, the
City Clerk shall transmit the map to the clerk of the county board of
supervisors. When all bonds, money, or negotiable bonds required under the
provision of this chapter to secure the payment of taxes and assessments
which are a lien on some part of the subdivision but which are not yet
payable, have been deposited with and approved by the board of supervisors,
the clerk of the board shall transmit the final map to the county recorder.
If the City Council shall determine either that the map is not in conformity
with the requirements of this chapter, or that it is not satisfied with the
plan of subdivision, it shall disapprove said map specifying its reason or
reasons therefor and the City Clerk shall in writing advise the subdivider of
such disapproval and of the reason or reasons for such disapproval. Within
thirty days after the City Council has disapproved any map, the subdivider
may file with the planning commission a map altered to meet the approval of
the City Council . In such case the subdivider shall conform to all the
requirements imposed upon him or her by this chapter when filing the first
final map with the planning commission, and the same proceedings shall be had
thereon as are prescribed by this chapter upon the filing of the first final
map with the planning commission. No map shall have any force or effect until
the same has been approved by the City Council and no title to any property
described in any offer of dedication shall pass until this recordation of the
final map. (Ord. 89 § 4.6(c), 1955).



16.16.150  IMPROVEMENTS – AGREEMENT.



   Upon the approval by the City Council of the final map, the subdivider
shall execute and file an agreement between himself and the city, specifying
the period within which he or she or his or her agent or contractor shall
complete all improvement work to the satisfaction of the city engineer, and
providing that if he or she shall fail to complete such work within such
period, the city may complete the same and recover the full cost and expense
thereof from the subdivider. The agreement may also provide as follows:



   A.   For the construction of the improvements in units;



   B.   For an extension of time under conditions therein specified;



   C.   For the termination of the agreement upon the completion of
proceedings under an assessment district act for the construction of
improvements deemed by city engineer to be at least the equivalent of the
improvement specified in said agreement and required to be constructed by the
subdivider; and



   D.   For progress payments.



(Ord. 89 § 4.7(part), 1955).



16.16.160  IMPROVEMENTS – BOND.



   The subdivider shall also file with the agreement mentioned in Section
16.16.150, to assure his or her full and faithful performance thereof, a bond
for such sum as is by the city engineer deemed sufficient to cover the cost
of the improvements, engineering, inspection, and incidental expenses, and to
cover replacement and repair of existing streets and other improvements
damaged in the development of the subdivision. Such bond shall be executed by
a surety company authorized to transact a surety business in the state of
California and may be satisfactory to and be approved by the City Attorney as
to form, by the city engineer as to sufficiency. In lieu of the bond, the
subdivider may deposit with the City Treasurer cash money in an amount as
deemed sufficient by the city engineer. (Ord. 89 § 4.7 (part), 1955).



16.16.170  IMPROVEMENTS – FAILURE TO COMPLETE.



   In the event the subdivider shall fail to complete all improvement work
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the city shall have
completed same, or if the subdivider shall fail to reimburse the city for the
cost of inspection, engineering, and incidental expenses, and to cover cost
of replacement and repair of existing streets or other improvements damaged
in the development of the subdivision, the city shall call on the surety for
reimbursement, or shall appropriate from any cash deposits funds for
reimbursement. In any such case, if the amount of surety bond or cash deposit
shall exceed all cost and expense incurred by the city, it shall release the
remainder of such bond or cash deposit, and if the amount of the surety bond
or cash deposit shall be less than the cost and expense incurred by the city,
the subdivider shall be liable to the city for such difference. (Ord. 89 §
4.7(part), 1955).



16.16.180  IMPROVEMENTS – CERTIFICATION OF COMPLETION.



   No extension of time progress payments from cash deposits, or releases
of surety bond or cash deposit shall be made, except upon certification by
the city engineer that work covered thereby has been satisfactorily
completed, and upon recommendation of the City Manager and approval of the
City Council. (Ord. 89 § 4.7(part), 1955).

16.28.010 PURPOSE.



   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section
66477 of the Government Code of the state of California. The park and
recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee
is required by this chapter are in accordance with the recreation element of
the general plan of the city. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.020  REQUIREMENTS.



   At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the
planning commission shall determine pursuant to Section 16.28.040 of this
chapter the land required for dedication or in-lieu fee payment. As a
condition of approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map, determination
shall be made whether the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu
thereof, or both, at the option of the city, for neighborhood and community
park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards
contained in this chapter. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.030  GENERAL STANDARD.



   It is found and determined that the existing neighborhood and community
parkland areas exceed five acres of property for each one thousand persons
residing in the city and therefor the public interest, convenience, health,
welfare and safety require a five-acre park standard for each one thousand
additional population. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.040  FORMULA FOR DEDICATION OF LAND.



   A.   Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the
general plan and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed
subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient
in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the
present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of
land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formula:



   The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as follows:



         2.9 (average persons/unit) : 1,000 population = .0145 ac/DU
                     5 (ac.)      or
                           631 sq. ft./DU



   B.   Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the
procedures contained in Section 16.28.090 of this chapter.



   C.   For the purposes of this section, the number of new dwelling
units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the map when in
an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the
subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per
parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units shall be used. In the case of a
condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of
condominium units. The term “new dwelling unit” does not include dwelling
units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is
filed.



   D.   The subdivider shall, without credit:



      1.   Provide full street improvements and utility connections
including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control
devices, street trees, and sidewalks to land which is dedicated pursuant to
this section;



      2.   Provide for fencing along the property line of that
portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land;



      3.   Provide improved drainage through the site; and



      4.   Provide other minimal improvements which the planning
commission determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for
recreational purposes. (Ord. 461 § 1 (part), 1984).



16.28.050  FORMULA FOR FEES IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION.



   A.   General Formula; Fifty-one Parcels or More. If there is no park
or recreation facility designated in the Pinole general plan to be located in
whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in
lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of that land, plus
twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements, prescribed for
dedication in Section 16.28.040 of this chapter, and in an amount determined
in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.28.060 of this chapter, such
fee to be used for a local or community park which bears a reasonable
relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area being
subdivided.



   For the purposes of this chapter, “off-site improvements” are
defined as those improvements which would have been required if land had been
dedicated using the provisions of Section 16.28.040.



   B.   Fees in Lieu of Land; Fifty Parcels or Less. if the proposed
subdivision contains fifty parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee
equal to the land value, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site
improvements, of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of
residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in Section 16.28.040 of
this chapter and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of
Section 16.28.060. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in
subdivisions of fifty parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes such
dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the planning commission.



   C.   Use of Money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only
for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or
rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to
serving the subdivisions. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.060  AMOUNT OF FEE IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION.



   When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, value of the
amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of
land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section
16.28.040 plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements, such as
extension of utility lines. The fees shall be calculated as follows:



   Formula for Computation of Dwelling Unit (DU) Fee



   631 (required sq. ft. dedication/DU) X $8 (land value) X 1.2



   (20% off-site improvement) = $6,057 Residential Dwelling Unit Fee



   This formula may be modified pursuant to the provisions of Chapter
16.28 to reflect approved parkland dedication. (Ord. 2005-06 § 1, 2005; Ord.
461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.070  DETERMINATION OF LAND OR FEE.



   Whether the planning commission accepts land dedication or elects to
require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be
determined by consideration of the following:



   A.   The natural features, access and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;



   B.   The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication;



   C.   The feasibility of dedication;



   D.   The compatibility of dedication with the Pinole general plan;
and



   E.   The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways.
(Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.080  CREDIT FOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACE.



   No credit shall be given for private open space in the subdivision
except as hereinafter provided. Where private open space usable for active

   A.   At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the
planning commission shall determine pursuant to Section 16.28.040 of this
chapter the land required for dedication. If the planning commission requires
in-lieu fee payment by the subdivider, the planning commission will set the
amount of land upon which the in-lieu fee will be based.



   B.   At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map or
parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land as required by the
planning commission. Where the planning commission has determined that fees
shall be paid in lieu of or in addition to the dedication of land, these fees
shall be paid on a lot-by-lot basis prior to the issuance of any building
permit for any building or structure to be located upon any one of the lots
in the subdivision. The in-lieu fees shall be based on the land dedication
requirements established at the time of tentative map approval using current
land values at the time of building permit issuance as set forth in Section
16.28.060. Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities
shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final subdivision map
or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final
subdivision map or parcel map. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).

   A.   Fees determined pursuant to Section 16.28.060 of this chapter
shall be paid to the city and shall be deposited into the subdivision park
trust fund. Money in said fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended
solely for acquisition or development of parkland, or improvements reasonably
related to serving the subdivision.



   B.   If such fees are not committed to a specific project within
five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half the lots
created by the subdivision, these fees, less an administrative charge, shall
be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the
same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all
lots in the subdivision.



   C.   The City Manager shall report to the City Council at least
annually on income, expenditures and status of the subdivision park trust
fund. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.110  EXEMPTIONS.



   The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial
subdivisions; nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives
which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment
building when no new dwelling units are added. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.120  SUBDIVIDER-PROVIDED PARK AND RECREATION IMPROVEMENTS.

credit for the value of park and recreation improvements provided by the
subdivider to dedicated land against the fees or dedication of land required
by this chapter. (Ord. 461 § 1(part), 1984).



16.28.130  STREET ACCESS – WAIVER.



   All land offered for dedication to local park or recreational purposes
shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This
requirement may be waived by the planning commission if the planning
commission determines that public street access is unnecessary for the
maintenance of the park area or use thereof by residents. (Ord. 461 §
1(part), 1984).

   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of this Zoning Code is to set forth and
coordinate city regulations governing the development and use of land in
accordance with the city general plan. The Zoning Code is intended to
accomplish the following:

that influence the community's quality of life.



      3.   Create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses to
help ensure the provision of adequate water, sewerage, transportation,
drainage, parks, open space, and other public facilities and services.



      4.   Protect the established character and the social and
economic stability of urban residential, commercial, industrial, and other
types of improved areas.



      5.   Provide a guide for the prezoning of properties within

man-made or natural hazards.



      8.   Ensure compatibility between residential and
non-residential development and land uses.



   B.   Intent. This Zoning Code is intended to:



      1.   Apply to all private, public, quasi-public, institutional
and public utility properties, and all other lands, buildings, and structures
within the incorporated area of the city as allowed by law; and



      2.   Establish future zoning of lands beyond the city limits
in the city's sphere of influence. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.04.030  APPLICABILITY.



   A.   Relationship to Prior Code. The provisions of this title, as it
existed prior to the effective date of the title enacting this title, are
repealed and superseded as provided in this title. No provision of this title
shall validate or legalize any land use or structure established,
constructed, or maintained in violation of the title as it existed prior to
its repeal by this title.



   B.   Prior Rights and Violations. The enactment of this title shall
not terminate or otherwise affect vested land use development permits,
approvals, or agreements authorized under the provisions of any ordinance,
nor shall violation of prior ordinance be excused by the adoption of this
title.



   C.   New Land Uses or Structures. It shall be unlawful and a
violation of the Pinole Municipal Ordinance for any person to establish,
construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace any use of land or structure,
except in compliance with the requirements of this title.



   D.   Continuation of an Existing Land Use or Structure. It is
unlawful and a violation of the Pinole Municipal Code for anyone to use a
parcel or structure or build a structure in a manner that violates any
provision of this title. However, a land use or structure that was lawfully
established before this title was enacted, or before enactment of any
applicable amendment to this title, may continue except as provided in
Chapter 17.14 (Nonconforming Uses and Structures). No expansion or
modification to a pre-existing legal nonconforming use or structure shall be
permitted except as allowed by Chapter 17.14 (Nonconforming Uses and
Structures).



   E.   Subdivisions. Any subdivision of land proposed within the city
after the effective date of this Zoning Code shall be consistent with the
minimum lot area requirements of Article II (Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses
and Development Standards), the subdivision requirements of the City of
Pinole Subdivision Ordinance (Title 16 of this Municipal Code), and all other
applicable requirements of this Zoning Code.



   F.   Effect of Zoning Code Changes on Projects in Process. The
enactment of this chapter or amendments to its requirements may have the
effect of imposing different standards on new land uses, development and/or
structures than those that applied to existing land uses, development and/or
structures. Following the effective date of this chapter, or any amendments
to this chapter, the following provisions shall apply:



      1.   Pending Applications. All land use permit applications
that have been determined by the department to be complete before the
effective date of this title or any amendment, will be processed according to
the regulations in effect when the application was accepted as complete.



      2.   Approved Projects Not Yet Under Construction. Any
structure authorized by a conditional use permit, site development review,
temporary use permit, or variance, for which construction has not begun as of
the effective date of this title or any amendment, may still be constructed
in compliance with the approved permit, as long as construction is completed
and the approved land use is established before the expiration of the permit
or, where applicable, before the expiration of any approved time extension.



      3.   Projects Under Construction. A structure that is under
construction pursuant to a valid building permit on the effective date of
this title or any amendment, may be completed and need not be changed to
satisfy any new or different requirements of this title as long as
construction is beyond the approval of the first inspection on the effective
date of this title or any amendment, and provided that construction is
diligently prosecuted to completion. Such a structure shall be deemed to be a
lawfully existing building.



   G.   Conflicting Requirements. Wherever conflict occurs between the
provisions of this title and any other provision of law, the more restrictive
of any such provisions shall apply.



      1.   Zoning Code and Municipal Code provisions. If conflicts
occur between requirements of this Zoning Code, or between this Zoning Code,
the municipal code, or other plans and policies adopted by the city, the most
restrictive shall apply.



      2.   General Plan. If conflict occurs between the requirements
of this Zoning Code and the adopted city general plan, the requirements of
the general plan shall govern.



      3.   Specific Plan. If conflicts occur between the
requirements of this Zoning Code and any adopted city specific plan, the
requirements of the specific plan shall govern.



      4.   Development Agreements. If conflicts occur between the
requirements of this Zoning Code and standards adopted as part of any
development agreement, the requirements of the development agreement shall
govern.



      5.   Private agreements. This Zoning Code applies to all land
uses and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser
restriction on the development or use of structures or land than a private
agreement or restriction (for example, CC&Rs) without affecting the
applicability of any agreement or restriction. The city shall not enforce any
private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or
agreement.



   H.   Other Requirements/Permits. Nothing in this Zoning Code
eliminates the need for obtaining any other permits required by the city, or
any permit, approval, or entitlement required by the regulations of any
regional, state, or federal agency.



   I.   Public Nuisance. Neither the provisions of this title nor any
permit or other approval authorized by this title shall authorize the
maintenance of any public nuisance as defined in this municipal code.



   J.   Severability, Partial Invalidation of Zoning Code. If any
portion of this title is for any reason held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, unconstitutional, or unenforceable, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this title. The
City Council hereby declares that this title and each article, chapter,
section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and
portion thereof is adopted, irrespective of the fact that one (1) or more
portions of this title may be declared invalid, unconstitutional, or
unenforceable. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

recovering the cost of such notification.



   D.   Receipt of Notice. Failure of any person or entity to receive
any properly issued notice required by law for any hearing required by this
title shall not constitute grounds for any court to invalidate the actions of
a designated approving authority for which the notice was given.



   E.   Hearing Procedure. Hearings as provided for in this chapter
shall be held at the date, time, and place for which notice has been given as

be prepared and made part of the permanent file of the case. Any hearing may
be continued to a date certain. If the hearing is not continued to a specific
date/time, then the hearing shall be re-noticed.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part),
2010)



17.10.060  APPROVING AUTHORITY.



   A.   Approving Authority. The approving authority as designated in
Table 17.10.060-1 (Approving Authority for Land Use Entitlements) shall
approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed land use or development
permit in accordance with the requirements of this title. Table 17.10.060-1

identifying the determination or action being appealed and specifically
stating the grounds or legal basis for the appeal. Appeals shall be filed
within ten (10) days following the date of determination or action for which

resolution, and submitted to the City Clerk.  Any staff, City Attorney, or
other appeals process costs beyond the filing fee shall be paid by the
project applicant or developer as specified in the City’s Master Fee
Schedule.



   D.   City Councilmember Appeal. A City Councilmember may appeal an
action of the Planning Commission as specified in Section 17.10.070C. A City
Councilmember appeal shall be processed in the same manner as an individual
appeal from a member of the public.



   E.   Notice and Schedule of Appeal Hearings. Unless otherwise agreed
upon by the person filing the appeal and the applicant, appeal hearings
should be conducted within forty-five (45) days from the date of appeal
submittal. Notice of hearing for the appeal shall be provided pursuant to
noticing requirements of Section 17.10.050 (Public Hearing and Public Notice).



   F.   Appeal Hearing and Action. Each appeal shall be considered a de
novo (new) hearing. In taking its action on an appeal, the Appeal Authority
shall state the basis for its action. The appeal authority may act to
confirm, modify, reverse the action of the approving authority, in whole or
in part, or add or amend such conditions as it deems necessary. The action of
the appeal authority is final on the date of decision and, unless expressly
provided by this chapter, may not be further appealed.  (Ord. 2017-01 § 2,
2017; Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.10.080  EFFECTIVE DATE.



   Generally, the action to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a
permit or entitlement authorized by this title shall be effective on the
eleventh (11th) day after the date of action, immediately following
expiration of the ten (10)-day appeal period. Legislative actions by the City
Council (e.g., Zoning Amendment, General Plan Amendment, Specific Plans, and
Development Agreements) become effective thirty (30) days from the date of
final action and may not be appealed. In accordance with Section 17.06.030
(Rules of Interpretation), where the last of the specified number of days
falls on a weekend or city holiday, the time limit of the appeal shall extend
to the end of the next working day. Permit(s) shall not be issued until the
effective date of required permit. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.10.090  PERMIT TO RUN WITH LAND.



   Unless otherwise conditioned, land use and development permits and
approvals granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall run with
the land through any change of ownership of the site, business, service, use,
or structures, provided that such use is compliant with this title or as
specified in the permit or approval, and the permit or approval does not
expire. All applicable conditions of approval shall continue to apply after a
change in property ownership. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.10.100  PERMIT TIME LIMITS, EXTENSIONS, AND EXPIRATION.



   A.   Time Limits. Unless a condition of approval or other provision
of this title establishes a different time limit, any permit not exercised
within one (1) year of approval shall expire and become void, except where an
extension of time is approved in compliance with division C. below. 



   B.   Exercising Permits. The exercise of a permit occurs when the
property owner has performed substantial work and incurred substantial
liabilities in good faith reliance upon such permit(s). A permit may be
otherwise exercised pursuant to a condition of the permit or corresponding
legal agreement that specifies that other substantial efforts or expenditures
constitutes exercise of the permit. Unless otherwise provided, permits that
have not been exercised prior to a zoning amendment, which would make the
permitted use or structure nonconforming, shall automatically be deemed
invalid on the effective date of the zoning amendment.



   C.   Permit Extensions. The approval of an extension extends the
expiration date for two (2) years from the original permit date. After this
initial permit extension, a final one (1)-year extension of time may be
granted pursuant to the same process as set forth in this section.



      1.   Process. The same approving authority that granted the
original permit may extend the period within which the exercise of a permit
must occur. Notice and/or public hearing shall be provided in the same manner
as for the original permit. An application for extension shall be filed not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the permit, along
with appropriate fees and application submittal materials. 



      2.   Conditions. The permit, as extended, may be conditioned
to comply with any development standards that may have been enacted since the
permit was initially approved. 



      3.   Permit extension findings. The extension may be granted
only when the designated approving authority finds that the original permit
findings can be made and there are no changed circumstances or there has been
diligent pursuit to exercise the permit that warrants such extension.



   D.   Expiration. If the time limits are reached with no extension
requested, or a requested extension is denied or expires, the permit expires.
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.10.110  MODIFICATION.



   A.   Any person holding a permit granted under this title may
request a modification or amendment to that permit. For the purpose of this
section, the modification of a permit may include modification of the terms
of the permit itself, project design, or the waiver or alteration of
conditions imposed in the granting of the permit.



   B.   If the Community Development Director determines that a
proposed project action is not in substantial conformance with the original
approval, the Community Development Director shall notify the property owner
of the requirement to submit a permit modification application for
consideration and action by the same approving authority as the original
permit. A permit modification may be granted only when the approving
authority makes all findings required for the original approval and the
additional finding that there are changed circumstances sufficient to justify
the modification of the approval. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.10.120  REVOCATION.



   This section provides procedures for the revocation previously approved
land use entitlements or permit.



   A.   Consideration. The approving authority for the original
entitlement or permit shall consider the revocation of same entitlement or
permit.



   B.   Noticed Public Hearing. The decision to revoke an entitlement
or permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be
considered at a noticed public hearing. Public notice shall be provided and
public hearing conducted pursuant to Section 17.10.050 (Public Hearing and
Public Notice).



   C.   Findings. A decision to revoke an entitlement or permit may be
made if any one (1) of the following findings can be made:



      1.   Circumstances under which the entitlement or permit was
granted have been changed by the applicant to a degree that one (1) or more
of the findings contained in the original entitlement or permit can no longer
be met.



      2.   The entitlement or permit was issued, in whole or in
part, on the basis of a misrepresentation or omission of a material statement
in the application, or in the applicant's testimony presented during the
public hearing, for the entitlement or permit.



      3.   One (1) or more of the conditions of the entitlement or
permit have not been substantially fulfilled or have been violated.



      4.   The use or structure for which the entitlement or permit
was granted has ceased to exist or has lost its legal nonconforming use
status.



      5.   The improvement authorized in compliance with the
entitlement or permit is in violation of any code, law, ordinance,
regulation, or statute.



      6.   The improvement/use allowed by the entitlement or permit
has become detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or the manner
of operation constitutes or is creating a public nuisance. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.10.130  REAPPLICATIONS.



   An application shall not be accepted or acted upon if within the past
twelve (12) months an application, which covers substantially the same real
property and requests approval of substantially the same project, has been
made and denied by the city unless the review authority allows the
reapplication because of an express finding that one (1) or more of the
following factors applies:



   A.   New evidence. New evidence potentially material to a revised
decision is presented which was unavailable or unknown to the applicant at
the previous hearing and which could not have been discovered in the exercise
of reasonable diligence by the applicant.



   B.   Substantial and permanent change of circumstances. There has
been a substantial and permanent change of circumstances since the previous
hearing which materially affects the applicant's real property.



   C.   Mistake made at the previous hearing. A mistake was made at the
previous hearing which was a material factor in the denial of the previous
application. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

administering all planning and zoning related permits and entitlements
required and regulated by the city in accordance with this title.  (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.020  APPLICABILITY.



   Each permit and entitlement type is described in this chapter in terms
of purpose and applicability, approving authority, and unique processing
provisions. Exemptions to permit requirements are listed throughout this
title. General processing procedures are established in Chapter 17.10
(General Application Processing Procedures). Provisions for tentative maps,
parcel maps, and final maps are identified in Title 16 of this Municipal
Code. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.030  PLAN CHECK.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of the plan check is to ensure that all
new and modified uses and structures comply with applicable provisions of
this title, using simple administrative plan check procedures.



   B.   Applicability. Plan check is required for the following actions:



      1.   All structures that require a building permit;



      2.   All planning entitlement and permit approvals to ensure
compliance with applicable conditions of approval; and



      3.   Other city applications that may be subject to the
provisions of this title, including, but not limited to, tree removal,
business license, encroachment, and grading and improvement plans.



   C.   Approving Authority and Procedure. The Community Development
Director shall be the designated approving authority for plan check.



   D.   Application Contents. No separate application form is necessary
for plan check. This process will be conducted by the Community Development
Director as part of the building permit or other city application review.



   E.   Public Hearing/Notice. Public hearing is not required for plan
check.



   F.   Approval Findings. Plan check clearance shall be granted only
when the Community Development Director finds the proposal to be in
conformance with all applicable provisions of this title. Any permit or
application listed in division A. shall not be issued without approval of
plan check.



   G.   Appeals. Any appeal of the decision for a plan check shall be
pursuant to Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   H.   Expiration. All approved plan checks are subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 17.10.100 (Revocation Permit Time Limits,
Extensions, and Expirations). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.040  SIMILAR USE DETERMINATION.



   A.   Purpose and Applicability. All possible uses may not be listed
within the provisions of this title, and new uses may evolve over time. When
a particular use is not specifically listed in this Zoning Code and it is
unclear whether the use is permitted, the provisions established in this
chapter allow the approving authority, by formal action, to determine whether
or not a proposed use is similar to a permitted or conditionally permitted
use and whether such proposed use may be permitted in a particular zoning
district.



   B.   Approving Authority. The Community Development Director shall
be the designated approving authority for similar use determinations.



   C.   Application Contents. The application for a similar use
determination shall be on a form prepared as prescribed by the Community
Development Director.



   D.   Public Hearing/Notice.  Public hearing is not required for a
similar use determination.



   E.   Approval Findings. In determining “substantial similarity,”
the approving authority shall make all of the following findings:



      1.   The characteristics of and activities associated with the
proposed use are equivalent to one (1) or more of the listed uses and will
not involve a higher level of activity or population density than the uses
listed in the zoning district;



      2.   The proposed use will be consistent with the purposes of
the applicable zoning district; and



      3.   The proposed use will be consistent with the general
plan, any applicable specific plan, and the zoning code.



   F.   Notification of Determinations. Determinations shall be made in
writing and shall contain the facts that support the determination. The city
shall maintain all such determinations on record for review by the general
public upon request. The decision shall be provided, in writing, to the
applicant and interested parties. The notice shall include:



      1.   A brief statement explaining the criteria and standards
considered relevant to the decision;



      2.   A statement of the standards and facts relied upon in
rendering the decision; and



      3.   Statement of appeal rights and appeal deadlines.



   G.   Appeals. Any appeal of the decision for a similar use
determination shall be pursuant to Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   H.   Expiration. All approved similar use determinations are subject
to the provisions set forth in Section 17.10.100 (Revocation Permit Time
Limits, Extensions, and Expirations). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.050  REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of allowing reasonable accommodation is to
provide a process for individuals with disabilities to make requests for
reasonable accommodation for relief from the various land use, zoning, or
rules, policies, practices, and/or procedures of the city. It is the policy
of the city, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Act (as amended) and the
California Fair Employment and Housing Act, to provide persons with
disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, and procedures that
may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing.



   B.   Applicability.



      1.   In order to make specific housing available to an
individual with a disability, a disabled person or representative may request
reasonable accommodation relating to the various land use, zoning, or rules,
policies, practices, and/or procedures of the city.



      2.   If an individual needs assistance in making the request
for reasonable accommodation or appealing a determination regarding
reasonable accommodation, the Community Development Director will endeavor to
provide the assistance necessary to ensure that the process is accessible to
the applicant or representative.



      3.   A request for reasonable accommodation with regard to
city regulations, rules, policies, practices, and/or procedures may be filed
on an application form provided by the Community Development Director at the
time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to
housing.



   C.   Approving Authority. The Community Development Director shall
be the designated approving authority for reasonable accommodation.



   D.   Application Contents. The applicant shall provide the following
information when requesting reasonable accommodation:



      1.   A completed city application indicating, among other
things, the applicant name, address, and telephone number;



      2.   Address of the property for which the request is being
made;



      3.   The current actual use of the property;



      4.   The Zoning Code provision, regulation, or policy from
which reasonable accommodation is being requested;



      5.   The basis for the claim that the person(s) for whom the
reasonable accommodation is sought is/are considered disabled under the Fair
Housing Act and why the accommodation is reasonably necessary to make
specific housing available to the person(s); and



      6.   Such other relevant information as may be requested by
the Community Development Director.



   E.   Procedure.



      1.   When a request for reasonable accommodation is filed with
the Community Development Director, it will be reviewed and considered as a
ministerial action unless determined otherwise by the Community Development
Director. A request for reasonable accommodation shall be considered
ministerial in nature when it is related to a physical improvement that
cannot be constructed to conform to the city's setbacks or design standards.
Typical improvements considered to be “ministerial” in nature would
include ramps, walls, handrails, or other physical improvements necessary to
accommodate a person's disability. The Community Development Director  shall
issue a written determination of his or her action within thirty (30) days of
the date of receipt of a completed application and may:



         a.   Grant or deny the accommodation request; or



         b.   Grant the accommodation request subject to
specified nondiscriminatory conditions(s); or



         c.   Determine that the request for reasonable
accommodation is non-ministerial in nature and forward the request to the
Planning Commission for consideration at a noticed public hearing. The
Planning Commission may grant or deny the request, or grant subject to
specified nondiscriminatory conditions. Any approval shall be subject to the
findings stated in Subsection 17.12.050.F (Approval Findings).



      2.   All written determinations of actions of the Community
Development Director  shall give notice of the right to appeal and the right
to request reasonable accommodation on the appeals process (e.g., requesting
that city staff attempt to schedule an appeal hearing as soon as legally and
practically possible), if necessary. The notice of action shall be sent to
the applicant by mail.



      3.   If necessary to reach a determination or action on the
request for reasonable accommodation, the Community Development Director may
request further information from the applicant specifying in detail what
information is required. In the event a request for further information is
made, the thirty (30)-day period to issue a written determination shall be
stayed until the applicant fully and sufficiently responds to the request.



   F.   Approval Findings. In making a determination regarding the
reasonableness of a requested accommodation, the approving authority must 
make all of the following findings:



      1.   The housing which is the subject of the request for
reasonable accommodation will be used for an individual protected under the
Fair Housing Act.



      2.   The request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to
make specific housing available to an individual protected under the Fair
Housing Act.



      3.   The requested reasonable accommodation does not impose an
undue financial or administrative burden on the city and does not
fundamentally alter city zoning, development standards, policies, or
procedures.



   G.   Appeals. Appeal of the approving authority's action on the
request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in accordance with the
procedures specified in Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   H.   Expiration. All approved reasonable accommodations are subject
to the provisions set forth in Section 17.10.100 (Revocation Permit Time
Limits, Extensions, and Expirations). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.060  ADMINISTRATIVE USE PERMIT.



   A.   Purpose. Administrative Use permits provide a mechanism for
administrative review and approval of uses and activities to ensure

approving authority may issue an administrative use permit when he or she
finds as follows:



      1.   The proposed use is consistent with the general plan and
the provisions of this title; and



      2.   All applicable conditions prescribed by ordinance or City
Council resolution have been satisfied.



   G.   Conditions of Approval. Whenever any administrative use permit
is granted, the designated approving authority may impose such conditions as

be the designated approving authority for temporary use permits.



   D.   Application Contents. The application for a temporary use
permit shall be on a form prepared as prescribed by the Community Development
Director.



   E.   Public Hearing/Notice. No public hearing is required for a
temporary use permit.



   F.   Approval Findings. The approving authority shall make the
following findings to approve or conditionally approve a temporary use permit
application:



      1.   The proposed use is a temporary use and will be limited
to a specific duration of time, as established in the temporary use permit.



      2.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use
will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to
the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the
vicinity of the proposed use.



      3.   The use, as described and conditionally approved, will
not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the

not function or be located in a manner that restricts access to any required
parking spaces.



      5.   Approved measures for the removal of the use and site
restoration have been required to ensure that no changes to the site would
limit the range of possible future land uses otherwise allowed by this Zoning
Code.



      6.   The approval includes provisions to ensure that each site
occupied by a temporary use shall be cleaned of debris, litter, or any other
evidence of the temporary use upon completion or removal of the use, and
shall thereafter be used in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning
Code. The approving authority may require appropriate security before
initiation of the use to ensure proper cleanup after the use is terminated.



      7.   The proposed temporary use is consistent with the general
plan, applicable specific plans and the provisions of this title.



   G.   Conditions of Approval. In approving a temporary use permit,
the approving authority may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, hours of
operation, landscaping and maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements,
parking, performance guarantees, property maintenance, signs, surfacing, time
limits, traffic circulation) deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that
the approval would be in compliance with the required findings.



   H.   Appeals. Appeal of the approving authority's action on the

17.12.080  ADMINISTRATIVE DESIGN REVIEW.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of Administrative Design Review is to
provide an efficient process for promoting the orderly and harmonious growth
of the city, to encourage development in keeping with the desired character
of the city, and to ensure physical and functional compatibility between
uses. Administrative design review is intended to provide a process for
consideration of minor development proposals to ensure that additions and
alterations to the design and layout of existing development will constitute
suitable development and will not result in a detriment to the city or to the
environment. 



   B.   Applicability. Administrative design review is required for all
structural additions to single family, multi-family and non-residential
structures. Additions for multi-family and non- residential structures that
are five hundred (500) square feet or larger require comprehensive design
review. Issues related to fire and public works compliance are addressed
during the plan check process. Issues related to Building Code compliance are
addressed at time of building permit issuance.



   C.   Approving Authority. The designated approving authority for
administrative design review is the Community Development Director.
Administrative design review approval is required prior to issuance of any
building permits or site improvement plans.



   D.   Application Contents. The application for an administrative
design review shall be on a form prepared as prescribed by the Community
Development Director.



   E.   Procedure. The procedures for administrative design review
shall be as provided in Chapter 17.10 (General Application Processing
Procedures) except as provided below:



      1.   No public hearing shall be required unless required
below. 



      2.   The city shall provide mailed notice pursuant to Section
17.10.050B.2. that the city is considering an application for administrative
design review. In addition to the content required under Section 17.10.050B.,
the mailed notice shall advise persons that plans for the project are
available for public review at City Hall and that the application will be
decided unless a written request for hearing is received by the City
Community Development Department on or before a date specified in the notice,
which shall be at least ten (10) working days after the date of mailing.



      3.   If no timely written request for hearing is filed, the
application shall be administratively approved by the Community Development
Director if it is deemed to be consistent with the provisions of this title.



      4.   If a timely written request for hearing is filed, the
application shall no longer be administratively processed and shall instead
be processed in accordance with the procedures for comprehensive design
review.



      5.   The Community Development Director may elevate any
project to the comprehensive design review process if in the opinion of the
Community Development Director, such project, because of location, size,
design, or other aspect of the project, warrants a hearing before the
Planning Commission.



   F.   Approval Findings. The approving authority shall make the
following findings to approve or conditionally approve an administrative
design review application:



      1.   Compliance with the general plan and any applicable
specific plans.



      2.   Compliance with applicable provisions of the Zoning Code.

   A.   Purpose. Sign permits provide a mechanism for administrative
review and determinations to ensure that new or replacement signs are
consistent with the general plan and provisions of the Zoning Code, including
a previously approved sign program. 



   B.   Applicability. A sign permit shall be required for all
permanent signs, as defined by this title, as follows. Where a sign is
proposed, no building permit may be issued until a sign permit has first been
approved and issued.



      1.   Prior to the establishment or erection of a new sign or
the replacement, alteration, or relocation of an existing permanent sign, as
specified in Section 17.52.030 (Permit Requirements and Review Procedures).

the applications may be granted in whole or in part, with separate decisions
as to each proposed sign. When an application is denied in whole or in part,
a written notice shall specify the ground(s) for such denial.



      2.   Public Hearing. The city shall provide notice and a
public hearing for continuation of the approval, modification, revocation or
appeal for an application for a sign permit, or an equivalent development
permit, in accordance with Section 17.10.050.



      3.   Revocation or cancellation. The Community Development
Director shall revoke any approval or permit upon refusal by the permit
holder to comply with the provisions of the permit after written notice of
noncompliance and at least thirty (30) days opportunity to correct. The
opportunity to correct does not apply in the event that the sign, by nature
of its physical condition, poses an imminent or significant threat to public
safety.



      4.   Timing. An application for a sign permit for a permanent
sign shall be submitted to the Community Development Director at the time the
building permit application is submitted.



      5.   Appeals. Appeal of the approving authority's action on
the request for a sign permit shall be made in accordance with the procedures
specified in Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   F.   Approval Findings. The approving authority may approve a sign
permit when the sign permit application and the sign itself complies with the
standards and requirements of this title. A sign permit application may be
approved subject to conditions, so long as those conditions are not in

17.12.100  CREATIVE SIGN PROGRAM.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of a creative sign program is to provide a
process for property owners and businesses to propose special deviations from
the regulations for on-site permanent signs provided in this title under
certain limited circumstances. The creative sign program also provides a
process for the city to review special signage types prior to issuance of a
sign permit.  The intent of the creative sign program is to:



      1.   Encourage signs of unique design that exhibit a high
degree of imagination, inventiveness, spirit, and thoughtfulness; and



      2.   Provide a process for the application of sign regulations
in ways that will allow creatively designed signs that make a positive visual
contribution to the overall image of the city, while mitigating the impacts
of large or unusually designed signs.



   B.   Applicability. An applicant may request approval of a creative
sign program in order to allow a sign that may require standards that differ
from the signage provisions of this title, but comply with the purpose and
findings for a creative sign program. Establishments that are eligible for
creative sign programs include any commercial, office, or industrial use in
the city.



   C.   Approving Authority. The Community Development Director shall
be the designated approving authority for creative sign programs.

information shall include the following:



      1.   The name, address, contact information, and signature of
the applicant, as well as the name, address, and contact information for the
contractor or installer and property owner. If the applicant is someone other
than the sign owner, then the sign owner's signature is also required on the
application form.



      2.   Proof of consent of the property owner or other person(s)
having the immediate right to possession and control of the property.



      3.   Preliminary information indicating how the sign will be
constructed and/or mounted to a building or structure.



      4.   Location, size, structure, and other descriptive
information required by the Community Development Director.



      5.   Such other on site or environmental conditions as the
Community Development Director may reasonably request to determine that the
proposed application is in full compliance with the provisions of this title,
the city municipal code, and other applicable law. The message proposed to be
displayed on the sign is not required but may be shown at the option of the
applicant.

as provided in Chapter 17.10 (General Application Processing Procedures)
except as provided below:



      1.   Multiple signs. One (1) creative sign program may be
submitted for multiple signs, provided all signs are on the same property or
contiguous parcels within the same zoning district and/or as part of the same
tenant. In such instances, the application may be granted in whole or in
part, with separate decisions as to each proposed sign. When an application
is denied in whole or in part, a written notice or the action shall be
provided to the applicant and shall specify the ground(s) for such denial.

creative sign program, except as set forth below:



         a.   Notice of the filing of an application for a
creative sign program shall be mailed to persons owning property within three
hundred (300) feet of the project site and posted on the property where the
sign or signs are proposed to be located. The mailed notice of application
shall advise persons that plans for the project are available for public
review at City Hall. The notice shall also indicate that the approving
authority will take final action on the application unless a written request
for hearing is received by the Community Development Director on or before
the date specified in the notice, which shall be at least ten (10) working
days from the date of mailing.



         b.   If no timely written request for hearing is filed,
the application shall be decided by the designated approving authority.



         c.   If a timely written request for hearing is filed,
the application shall no longer be administratively processed and shall
instead be decided at a public hearing of the Planning Commission.



         d.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the approving
authority may elevate any project to a Planning Commission decision if, in
the opinion of the approving authority, such project is not in substantial
conformance with the intent of the creative sign permit or if the approving
authority determines that the location, size, or design of the project
warrants a hearing before the Planning Commission.



      3.   Revocation or cancellation. The Community Development
Director shall revoke any creative sign program upon refusal by the permit
holder to comply with the provisions of the creative sign program after
written notice of noncompliance and at least thirty (30) days opportunity to
correct. In the event that the sign, by nature of its physical condition,
poses an imminent or significant threat to public safety, the Community
Development Director shall revoke the creative sign program and order
immediate correction of the safety hazard.



      4.   Timing. An application for a creative sign program shall
be submitted to the Community Development Director prior to submittal of an

on a form prepared as prescribed by the Community Development Director.



   D.   Public Hearing/Notice. Public hearing and notice are required
for a variance pursuant to Section 17.10.050 (Public Hearing and Notice).



   E.   Approval Findings. The approving authority may approve and/or
modify any variance application in whole or in part, with or without
conditions, only if the applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances of
their particular case can justify making all of the following findings:



      1.   There are special circumstances applicable to the
property (e.g., location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other
conditions), so that the strict application of this Zoning Code denies the
property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity
and within the same zoning district.



      2.   Granting the variance is necessary for the preservation
and enjoyment of substantial property rights enjoyed by other property owners
in the same vicinity and zoning district and denied to the property owner for
which the variance is sought.



      3.   Granting the variance will not adversely affect the
interests of the public or the interests of residents and property owners in
the vicinity of the premises in question.



      4.   The variance is consistent with the general plan, any
applicable specific plan or development agreement, and the intent of this
title.



   F.   Conditions of Approval. In approving a variance, the approving
authority:



      1.   Shall impose conditions to ensure that the variance does
not grant special privileges inconsistent with the limitation on other
properties in the vicinity and the zoning district in which the property is
located;



      2.   May impose any reasonable conditions (e.g., the
placement, height of structures, buffers, landscaping and maintenance,
off-site improvements, performance



guarantees, screening, surfacing, hours of operation) to ensure that the
approval complies with the findings required by this section.



   G.   Permit Issuance. The final action on the variance by the
approving authority shall constitute approval of the variance. The variance
shall only become valid after the designated appeal period has been
completed, per the provisions as set forth in Section 17.10.080 (Effective
Date).



   H.   Appeals. Appeal of the approving authority's action on the
request for variance shall be made in accordance with the procedures
specified in Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   I.   Expiration. All approved variance are subject to the provisions
set forth in Section 17.10.100 (Revocation Permit Time Limits, Extensions,

17.12.160  DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.



   A.   Purpose. This section establishes procedures and requirements
for the review and approval of development agreements when applied for as
part of a land use entitlement in compliance with the provisions of
California Government Code Sections 65864 through 65869.5. The City Council
finds and declares the use of development agreements is beneficial to the
public, in that:



      1.   Development agreements increase the certainty in the
approval of development projects, thereby preventing the waste of resources,
reducing the cost of development to the consumer, and encouraging investment
in and commitment to comprehensive planning, all leading to the maximum
efficient utilization of resources at the least economic cost to the public.



      2.   Development agreements provide assurance to the applicant
for a development project that upon approval of the project, the applicant
may proceed with the project in accordance with existing policies, rules and
regulations, and subject to conditions of approval, thereby strengthening the
public planning process, encouraging private participation in comprehensive
planning, and reducing the economic costs of development.



      3.   Development agreements enable the city to plan for and
finance public facilities, including, but not limited to, streets, sewerage,
transportation, drinking water, school, and utility facilities, thereby
removing a serious impediment to the development of new housing.



   B.   Qualified Applicant. Only a qualified applicant, a person who
has legal or equitable interest in the real property which is the subject of
the development agreement (or his or her authorized agent), may submit an
application for a development agreement.



   C.   Approving Authority. The designated approving authority for
development agreements is the City Council which shall hold a public hearing
prior to taking action. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed development agreement and make a recommendation to the City
Council.



   D.   Flexibility of Development Regulations.



      1.   To the extent permitted by law, any development agreement
if adopted by the city may modify development rules, regulations, and
policies governing permitted uses of land and density, and governing design,
improvements, construction standards and specifications, and phasing
applicable to development of the property involved in the agreement.



      2.   Nothing contained in these regulations shall prevent the
developer or the city from proceeding with normal tentative map or final map
processes on any phase of a development which is the subject of a development
agreement at any time during its term.



   E.   Application Contents. The contents of a development agreement
shall be as set forth in Government Code Sections 65865.2, 65867.5(c) if
applicable, and 65868.5.



   F.   Public Hearing/Notice. The city shall provide notice and a
public hearing for consideration of the approval or modification of an
application for a development agreement in accordance with Section 17.10.050
(Public Hearing and Public Notice).



   G.   Approval Findings. A development agreement may only be granted
when the City Council makes all of the following findings specifying that the
development agreement:



      1.   Is consistent with the objectives, policies, and general
land uses specified in the general plan and any applicable specific plans;



      2.   Is compatible and in conformity with public convenience,
general welfare, and good land use and zoning practice;



      3.   Will not be detrimental to health, safety, and general
welfare of the city;



      4.   Will not adversely affect the orderly development of
property or the preservation of property values.



   H.   Amendment and Cancellation of Agreement. Any party to the
agreement may propose an amendment to or cancellation in whole or part of the
development agreement, the procedure for which is the same as the procedure
for entering into the agreement initially. Notice of intention to amend or
cancel any portion of the development agreement shall be given as provided in
Section 17.10.050 (Public Hearing and Public Notice).



   I.   Recordation. Within ten (10) days after the city enters into
the development agreement or any amendment thereof, the City Clerk shall
cause the agreement or amendment to be recorded with the County Recorder. 
Additionally, the City Clerk shall be the official custodian of the
development agreement file. Said file shall include an executed copy of the
agreement and the originals of all exhibits, reports of periodic review,
amendments, and/or cancellations to the development agreement.



   J.   Periodic Review. The Community Development Director shall
review the development agreement every twelve (12) months from the date the
development agreement is entered into and provide a written report to the
City Council. The burden of proof is on the applicant to provide necessary
information verifying good faith compliance with the terms of the development
agreement. The applicant shall also bear the cost of such review in
accordance with the fee established by City Council resolution. If the
Community Development Director finds that any aspect of the development
project is not in good faith compliance with the terms of the development
agreement, the Community Development Director may schedule the matter before
the appropriate approving authority(ies) for review for possible amendment or
revocation.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.170  SPECIFIC PLANS.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of a specific plan is to provide a vehicle
for implementing the city's general plan on an area-specific basis. The
specific plan is intended to serve as a regulatory document, consistent with
the general plan. In the event there is an inconsistency or conflict between
an adopted specific plan and comparable provisions of this title, the
specific plan shall prevail. This section is consistent with California
Government Code Section 65450 et seq. This section describes the process for
adopting and amending specific plans, and approving subsequent development
under a specific plan. Chapter 17.26 (Special Purpose Zoning Districts)
describes the individual specific plan districts and adopts them by
reference. 



   B.   Applicability. The city's general plan encourages preparation
of specific plans and identifies certain areas of the city which require
specific plans for development. Specific plan zoning may be considered for
other areas of the city.



   C.   Approving Authority. The designated approving authority for
specific plans is the City Council which shall hold a public hearing prior to
taking action. The Planning Commission shall review specific plans, hold a
public hearing, and make recommendations regarding the content of the plan,
or any amendments. The City Council shall approve, conditionally approve or
deny any specific plan or amendment thereto.



   D.   Application Contents. In addition to the minimum content
requirements of California Government Code Section 65451, the specific plan
application shall include following items: 



      1.   Statement of the relationship of the specific plan to the
general plan;



      2.   Policies for development and standards for regulating
development within the plan area;



      3.   The proposed land uses for all areas covered by the plan;



      4.   The types and configurations of buildings to be included
in all developments within the plan area;



      5.   The location of and types of streets;



      6.   Public facilities and infrastructure required to serve
developments within the specific plan area;



      7.   A parking and circulation plan for off-street parking
areas showing the location of parking lots, the approximate number of spaces,
and the approximate location of entrances and exits;



      8.   Proposed conservation, open space, and/or recreation
areas, if any; and



      9.   Any other programs, guidelines, or standards appropriate
for the area covered by the plan.



   E.   Environmental Review. It is anticipated, under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and guidelines, that most specific plans
will require preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR). Once
certified, the EIR for a specific plan may be relied upon for further
entitlements sought subsequent to adoption of the specific plan to the extent
allowed by CEQA. Unless otherwise exempt, an initial study shall be prepared
for all subsequent applications to determine whether additional CEQA review
is required.



   F.   Public Hearing/Notice. The city shall provide notice and a
public hearing for consideration of the approval or modification of an
application for a specific plan in accordance with Section 17.10.050 (Public
Hearing and Public Notice).



   G.   Approval Findings. Specific plans and any amendment thereto
shall be approved only when the City Council makes the following findings:



      1.   The proposed specific plan is consistent with the general
plan goals, policies, and implementation programs.



      2.   The land use and development regulations within the
specific plan are comparable in breadth and depth to similar zoning
regulations contained in this title.



      3.   The administration and permit processes within the
specific plan are consistent with the administration and permit processes of
the Zoning Code.



   H.   Adoption. Adoption of the specific plan shall be by ordinance
of the City Council shall constitute final action and approval of the
specific plan. Authorization for construction in accordance with the specific
plan may only be granted after the effective date of the adoption.



   I.   Delineation of Specific Plan Areas. On the zoning map, a
specific plan zoning district shall be delineated in a manner similar to that
of any other zoning district except that each specific plan-zoned area shall
also bear a number, text, or other symbol which distinguishes it from other
specific plan areas. See Chapter 17.26 (Special Purpose Districts/Specific
Plan Districts).



   J.   Application of Specific Plan Development Requirements. Where
conditions of the specific plan are more restrictive than the Zoning Code
development standards, the conditions of the specific plan shall apply. Where
a standard is not addressed in the specific plan, the Zoning Code shall
apply.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.180  PREZONING.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of prezoning is to establish the zoning
district for unincorporated property as part of an annexation proposal. This
section is consistent with California Government Code Section 65859.



   B.   Procedure. The procedure, review, and action for prezoning are
the same as that established for a Zoning Code Amendment pursuant to Section
17.12.190 (Zoning Code (Text and Map) Amendment).  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)

zoning designation on the zoning map for any parcel(s). This section is
consistent with California Government Code Section 65853.



   B.   Approving Authority. The designated approving authority for
zoning amendments is the City Council which shall hold a public hearing on
the Planning Commission recommendation prior to taking action. The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing and then shall provide a
recommendation, which recommendation shall include the reasons for the
recommendation and the relationship of the proposal to the general plan and
the specific plans. The City Council approves, conditionally approves, or
denies the zoning amendment in accordance with the requirements of this title.



   C.   Initiation of Amendment. A zoning amendment to this title may
be initiated by motion of the Planning Commission or City Council, by
application by property owner(s) of parcel(s) to be affected by zoning
amendment, or by recommendation of the Community Development Director to
clarify text, address changes mandated by state law, maintain General plan
consistency, address boundary adjustments affecting land use designation(s),
or for any other reason beneficial to the city.



   D.   Approval Findings. Zoning amendments shall be granted only when

with the general plan goals, policies, and implementation programs.



   E.   Adoption. Adoption of the Zoning Amendment by ordinance of the
City Council shall constitute final action and approval of the amendment.
Authorization for construction or occupancy in accordance with the amendment
may only be granted upon or after the effective date of the action. (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.200  GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of a general plan amendment is to allow
for modifications to the general plan text (e.g., goals, policies, or
implementation programs) or to change the general plan land use designation
on any parcel(s).



   B.   Approving Authority. The designated approving authority for
general plan amendments is the City Council which shall hold a public hearing
prior to taking action. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing
and provide a recommendation. The City Council approves, conditionally
approves, or denies the general plan amendment in accordance with the
requirements of this title.



   C.   Frequency of Amendment. Pursuant to Government Code Section
65358, no mandatory element of the general plan may be amended more
frequently than four (4) times during any calendar year. Subject to that
limitation, an amendment may be made at any time and may include more than
one (1) change to the general plan.



   D.   Initiation of Amendment. A general plan amendment may be
initiated by the Planning Commission or City Council, by application by
property owner(s) of parcel(s) to be affected by the general plan amendment,

(Public Hearing and Public Notice).



   G.   Approval Findings. The City Council may approve a general plan
amendment upon finding that the amendment is in the public interest and that
the general plan as amended will remain internally consistent. In the event
that a general plan amendment is requested by a private property owner, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the City Council that there is a substantial
public benefit to be derived from such amendment and how the proposed
amendment furthers the goals of the general plan.



   H.   Adoption. Adoption of the general plan amendment by the City
Council shall constitute final action and approval of the amendment.  (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.12.210  SMALL CELL ATTACHMENT PERMIT.



   A small cell attachment permit is required prior to the development,
siting, installation and operation of a small cell wireless facility. Small

CHAPTER 17.14
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES



Sections:



   17.14.010   Purpose.



   17.14.020   Applicability and general regulations.



   17.14.030   Continuation.



   17.14.040   Maintenance.



   17.14.050   Modification, expansion, and reconstruction.



   17.14.060   Structural alterations.



   17.14.070   Repair and replacement of destroyed buildings.



   17.14.080   Loss of nonconforming status.



17.14.010  PURPOSE.



   This chapter establishes special regulations for nonconforming land
uses and structures that were lawful before the adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
differently under the current terms of this Zoning Code or future amendments.
It is the intent of these regulations to allow the continuation of
nonconformities under the limited conditions outlined herein and
reconstruction in the event of natural disaster.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part),
2010)



17.14.020  APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL REGULATIONS.



   A.   Legal Nonconforming Uses. The provisions of this chapter apply
to legal nonconforming uses in districts hereafter changed or established and
any time limit for the suspension of a nonconforming use of land shall date
from May 19, 1971, or any amendment of district boundaries which first
creates a nonconforming use or uses.



   B.   Exemption: Legal Building Site and Time Limitation. A
nonconforming parcel that does not comply with the applicable area or width
requirements of this Zoning Code shall be considered a legal building site if
it meets at least one (1) of the following criteria, as documented to the
satisfaction of the Community Development Director through evidence furnished
by the applicant.  On nonconforming parcels where the below criteria is not
met, the nonconforming use of land (where no main building is involved)
existing at the time this title becomes effective shall be discontinued
within one (1) year from the effective date of this title or within one (1)
year from any amendments to this title that cause a land use to be
nonconforming.



      1.   Approved subdivision. The parcel was created by a
recorded subdivision.



      2.   Individual parcel legally created by deed. The parcel is
under one (1) ownership and of record, and was legally created by a recorded
deed before the effective date of the zoning amendment that made the parcel
nonconforming.



      3.   Variance or lot line adjustment. The parcel was approved
through the variance procedure or resulted from a lot line adjustment.



      4.   Partial government acquisition. The parcel was created in
compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code, but was made
nonconforming when a portion was acquired by a governmental entity so that
the parcel size is decreased not more than twenty percent (20%) and the yard
facing a public right-of-way was decreased not more than fifty percent (50%).



   C.   Exemption: Public Utilities. The provisions of this chapter
shall not apply so as to prevent the modernization or replacement of public
utility buildings, structures, equipment, and facilities where there is no
change of use or increase in area of property so used.



   D.   Nonexempt: Subdivision of a Nonconforming Parcel. No
subdivision shall be approved that would increase the nonconformity of an
existing parcel or any nonconforming use on the parcel; existence of a legal
nonconforming use or parcel shall not be interpreted to allow the increase of
the nonconformity of such parcel or any nonconforming use on the parcel. 
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.14.030  CONTINUATION.



   A.   Continuation. A nonconforming use may continue to operate in
perpetuity, be transferred, or be sold, provided that the use shall not be
enlarged or intensified nor be expanded to occupy a greater area than it
lawfully occupied before becoming nonconforming.



   B.   Approved Plans, Effective Date, and Extension. Plans for any
use approved as of the effective date of this chapter may be carried out as
approved. Any extension of such approval for which the applicant was entitled
to apply as of the effective date may be granted according to the regulations
in effect prior to the effective date; if granted, such extension will be
considered the same as an approval granted before the effective date.



   C.   Prohibited Use. Any person asserting that a nonconforming use
is legal must present evidence that the use existed before the enactment of
the Zoning Code provision prohibited the use. The Community Development
Director shall have Approval Authority over this determination. (Ord. 2010-02
§ 1 (part), 2010)



17.14.040  MAINTENANCE.



   Normal maintenance of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted
subject to Building Code requirements in effect at the time of such
maintenance work and as provided below. (Ord. 440 § 2 (part), 1982)



   A.   Repair. Maintenance may include repair work necessary to keep
the structure in sound condition, but maintenance shall not include the
expansion or replacement of a non-conforming structure.



   B.   Seismic Retrofitting and Building Code Compliance. Repairs,
alterations, or reconstruction to reinforce unreinforced masonry structures
or to comply with Building Code requirements shall be allowed, provided that
the work is exclusively to comply with applicable earthquake safety standards
and the Building Code.



   C.   Structural Alteration. Maintenance and repair may include
structural alteration of a nonconforming structure to improve safety or to
reduce fire hazard. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.14.050  MODIFICATION, EXPANSION, AND RECONSTRUCTION.



   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.14.030 (Continuation), and
subject to the provisions of Section 17.12.130 (Variance), a nonconforming
structure or use may be modified or expanded as listed below:



   A.   Structural Modification. Addition, enlargement, extension, or
relocation of a nonconforming structure may be allowed if the changes to the
structure conform to all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code. Such
modifications may not expand the extent of the nonconforming aspect of the
structure or result in any new nonconforming conditions for the subject
property.



   B.   Expansion of Use. The designated approving authority may
consider expansion or modification of a nonconforming use up to a maximum of
ten percent (10%) of the area that the structure lawfully occupied before
becoming nonconforming.



   C.   Design Review. Exterior improvements or expansion of structures
shall also require design review approval pursuant to Section 17.12.080
(Administrative Design Review). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.14.060  STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS.



   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more
restricted classification. (Ord. 440 § 2 (part), 1982) (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.14.070  REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF DESTROYED BUILDINGS.



   A.   Ministerial Building Permit Required. If a nonconforming
structure in existence or use maintained on November 16, 2010, which does not
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located, is
involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, flood, wind,
earthquake, explosion, act of God, or act of the enemy, subsequent to the
effective date of this title and the expense of such reconstruction is less
than or equal to fifty percent (50%) of the assessed value of the structure
at such time just prior to the damage occurring, then without further action
by the City Council, such structure and use of land may be repaired,
restored, replaced, or reconstructed and reoccupied in the same manner in
which it originally existed upon issuance of a ministerial building permit
and subject to the following terms:



      1.   All such reconstruction shall be performed under one (1)
building permit;



      2.   All such reconstruction shall be initiated within a
period of one (1) year from date of damage; and



      3.   All such reconstruction shall be diligently pursued to
completion.



   B.   Conditional Use Permit Required. If the repair, restoration,
replacement, or reconstruction expands from the original state of the
nonconforming structure, at such time just prior to the damage occurring,
issuance of a conditional use permit, pursuant to the provisions set forth in
Section 17.12.140 (Conditional Use Permit) is required. The approving
authority may consider up to a maximum ten percent (10%) expansion of the
square footage from the original state of the nonconforming structure at such
time just prior to the damage occurring. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.14.080  LOSS OF NONCONFORMING STATUS.



   A.   If any nonconforming use is abandoned or discontinued for any
reason for a continuous period of six (6) months or more, rights to
nonconforming status shall terminate. Without further action by the city, any
subsequent use of such land or structure shall be in conformity with all of
the regulations of the applicable zoning district and all other applicable
provisions of this title.



   B.   A determination that a use has been abandoned requires both (1)
evidence of an intention to abandon, and (2) an act or failure to act which
shows or implies that the owner does not continue to claim or retain an
interest in the nonconforming use. Evidence may include, but is not limited
to, removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other
components of the nonconforming use, disconnected or discontinued utilities,
or no business records to document continued operation. Maintenance of a
valid business license shall in itself not be considered a continuation of
the use. The discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of six (6)
months or more is in itself prima facie evidence of abandonment. (Ord. 440 §
2 (part), 1982). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

      7.   A statement that the property owner may request and be
provided a meeting with the Community Development Director  to discuss
possible methods and time limits for the correction of the violations; and



      8.   A statement that there is a right of appeal for the
summary of costs as provided in Section 17.16.090 within ten (10) days of
service of such summary of costs.



   B.   Time Limit for Correction.



      1.   The notice of violation shall state that the violations
shall be corrected within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to
avoid further enforcement action by the city.



      2.   The thirty (30)-day time limit may be extended by the
Community Development Director upon determining that the responsible party
will likely correct the violations within a reasonable time period.



      3.   The Community Development Director may also require
through the notice of violation that the correction occur within less than
thirty (30) days if the violation constitutes a hazard to public health or
safety.

appealed pursuant to Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   D.   Use of Other Enforcement Procedures. Additional enforcement
remedies available to the city may be employed by the Community Development
Director after or instead of the provisions of this section where the
Community Development Director determines that this section would be
ineffective in securing the correction of the violation within a reasonable
time. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.16.080  RECOVERY OF COSTS AND ADDITIONAL FEES.

maintain records of all administrative costs incurred by responsible city
departments and associated with the processing of violations and enforcement
of this Zoning Code and shall recover costs from the property owner.



      2.   Summary of costs. At the conclusion of an enforcement
case, the Community Development Director shall send a summary of costs
associated with enforcement, and a statement that there is the right to
appeal within ten (10) days of the date of this summary statement, but that
failure to appeal will eliminate the right to object to such costs to the
owner and persons having possession or control of the property by certified
and first class mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested.



   B.   Actions that Require a Permit or Entitlement. Any person who
alters or establishes any land use or structure without first obtaining any
permit or entitlement required by this Zoning Code shall pay for the
additional permit or entitlement processing fees as established by the city
that result from the action.



   C.   Public Hearing. Any property owner, or other person having

Section 17.16.080 (Recovery of Costs and Additional Fees), shall have the
right to request a public hearing on objections to the summary of costs
before the Community Development Director, within ten (10) days of receiving
such summary of costs.



      1.   The hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of

      4.   If the costs have not been paid within forty-five (45)
days of notice, the costs shall be recoverable in a civil action in the name
of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction, or by recording a lien
against the property. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

CHAPTER 17.18
ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND LAND USE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM



Sections:



   17.18.010   Purpose.



   17.18.020   Zoning districts.



   17.18.030   Conformance with zoning district regulations.

   17.18.070   Similar use determination.



17.18.010  PURPOSE.



   This chapter establishes the framework of zoning districts within the
city and their relationships to the city's general plan land use
categories.  This chapter also establishes the zoning map as the official
designation of zoning district boundaries.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.18.020  ZONING DISTRICTS.



   A.   Zoning districts are established in order to classify,
regulate, restrict and segregate the uses of land and buildings; to regulate
and restrict the height and bulk of buildings;  to regulate the area of
yards and other open spaces about buildings; and to regulate the density of
population, classes of land use zoning districts are established.



   B.   The city is divided into zoning districts that are generally
grouped into two (2) categories:  A) base zoning districts, and B) special
purpose zoning districts. These districts conform to and implement the city's
general plan land use categories as described in Table 17.18.020-1. 
Subsequent chapters in this article identify allowed uses and requirements
for planning entitlements, as well as development standards unique to each
zoning district.



      1.   Base Zoning Districts.  The base zoning district is the
primary zoning district that applies to a property.  Every parcel located
outside of the specific plan area throughout the city has a base zoning
district that establishes the primary type and intensity of land use for the
parcel, along with development regulations for that particular type and
intensity of land use for the parcel, along with development regulations for
that particular type and intensity of land use.  Base districts are grouped
into five (5) categories as follows:



         a.   Residential zoning districts.



         b.   Rural zoning districts.



         c.   Commercial zoning districts.



         d.   Mixed use zoning districts.



         e.   Public, quasi-public, and recreational zoning
districts.



      2.   Special purpose zoning districts.  The special purpose
zoning district either functions as the base zoning district or supplements
the base zoning district and requires special project entitlement, which
allows for flexibility from traditional development standards.  There are
two (2) special purpose zoning districts:



         a.   Specific plan zoning districts that require
submittal for a specific plan document for proposed development that will
replace the city's zoning regulations for the subject parcel(s). This
designation is typically applied to larger land areas that warrant master
planning.



         b.   Planned development zoning districts are limited to
property zoned PD-Planned Development as of the effective date this title.



   C.   In the event of a conflict between the regulations of the base
zoning district and the special purpose zoning district, the provisions of
the special purpose zoning district shall apply.

17.18.030  CONFORMANCE WITH ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS.



   Except as otherwise provided in this title:



   A.   No building shall be erected, and no existing building shall be
moved, altered, added to or enlarged, nor shall any land, building or
premises be used, designed or intended to be used for any purpose or in any
manner other than listed in this title, or amendments thereto, as permitted
in the zoning districts in which such land, building or premises is located.



   B.   No building shall be erected nor any existing building be
moved, reconstructed or structurally altered to exceed in height the limit
established by this title, or amendments thereto, for the zoning district in
which such building is located.



   C.   No building shall be erected nor shall any existing building be
moved, altered or enlarged nor shall any open spaces surrounding any building
be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the
building-site requirements and the area and yard regulations established by
this title, or amendments thereto, for the zoning district in which such
building is located. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.18.040  ZONING MAP.



   The City Council hereby adopts the City of Pinole Zoning Map (hereafter
referred to as the “Zoning Map”) as the official designation of zoning
district boundaries on real property within the City.  The Zoning Map shall
be regulated as set forth:



   A.   Incorporated by Reference.  The zoning map is hereby
incorporated into this Zoning Code by reference.



   B.   Relationship to the General Plan.  The zoning map shall
implement and shall be consistent with the city's adopted general plan. 
Specifically, the Zoning Map shall be consistent with the general plan land
use plan. 



   C.   Relationship to Specific Plans. The specific plans adopted in
the City of Pinole establish special zoning regulations and other design and
development provisions in designated portions of the city. As such, the
specific plans essentially replace the citywide zoning regulations in those
areas and are shown on the zoning map with the adopted specific plan name
and/or number, referring the reader to the adopted specific plan document to
govern subsequent land development within the plan area. The Zoning Code
shall be relied upon for development topics not included within the specific
plan. In the event of a conflict between the specific plan and the zoning
code, the specific plan shall prevail.



   D.   Planned Developments. In addition to the zoning district symbol
for the PD District, a reference to the PD-Planned Development ordinance for
the site shall be included on the zoning map whenever possible.



   E.   Zoning District Symbol.  Zoning districts shall be illustrated
on the zoning map as follows:



      1.   Each base zoning district shall be described on the
zoning map by use of its identified zoning district symbol, as listed in
Table 17.18.020-1. 



      2.   Special purpose zoning districts shall be delineated with
a name, number, symbol, or other delineation, as determined by the Community
Development Director, which distinguishes it from other special purpose
zoning districts or base zoning districts.  The assignment of the special
purpose designation serves to provide a reference to the corresponding
special purpose zoning document (e.g. Specific Plan, Planned Development)
adopted by ordinance of the City Council.



   F.   Zoning Map Interpretation. If there is uncertainty about the
location of any zoning district boundary shown on the zoning map, the precise
location of the boundary shall be determined by the Community Development
Director  as follows:



      1.   Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately
following street and alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed
to be such boundaries.



      2.   In unsubdivided property or where a zone boundary divides
a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by
dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.



      3.   In case any uncertainty exists, the Planning Commission
shall determine the location of boundaries.



      4.   Where any public street or alley is officially vacated or
abandoned, the regulations applicable to abutting property shall apply to
such vacated or abandoned street or alley.



      5.   Where any private right-of-way or easement of any
railroad, railway, canal, transportation or public utility company is vacated
or abandoned, the regulations applicable to abutting property shall apply to
such vacated or abandoned property. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.18.050  CLASSIFICATION OF LAND USES.



   A.   In order to simplify land use regulations, land uses listed in
this article and throughout this title have been grouped into general
categories on the basis of common function, product, or compatibility
characteristics.  These allowed use categories are called “Use
Classifications.”  Use classifications describe one (1) or more uses
having similar characteristics but do not list every use or activity that may
appropriately be within the classification.  Each land use is described in
Chapter 17.22 (Allowed Use Definitions).  For example, “personal service
use” includes a wide range of individual personal service uses (beauty
parlor, dry cleaning, tanning salons, tailors). Rather than listing all such
uses individually throughout this title, “personal service use” is listed
once and is further defined in Chapter 17.22 (Allowed Use Definitions).



   B.   The following rules apply to use classifications:



      1.   Special Use Regulations.  Additional use regulations for
special land uses are listed in Article IV. (Standards for Specific Land
Uses).



      2.   Uses Not Listed.  Land uses that are not listed in the
zoning district tables are not allowed, except as otherwise provided for in
this title.



      3.   Illegal Uses.  No use that is illegal under local,
state, or federal law shall be allowed in any zoning district within the
city. 



      4.   Special Purpose Zoning District. When a property is
located within a special purpose zoning district, the allowed use provisions
of that special purpose zoning district shall prevail.  When a special
purpose zoning district is silent (Planned Developments) on allowed use
provisions, it defers the allowed use provisions to the base zoning
district.  Only where there is a conflict do the special purpose zoning
district provisions prevail.



      5.   Similar Uses.  When a use is not specifically listed in
this code, it shall be understood that the use may be permitted if the
Community Development Director determines that the use is substantially
similar to other uses listed based on established criteria and required
findings outlined in Section 17.18.070 (Similar Use Determination).  It is
further recognized that every conceivable use cannot be identified in this
title and, anticipating that new uses will evolve over time, the Community
Development Director may make a similar use determination to compare a
proposed use and measure it against those uses listed.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.18.060  ALLOWED LAND USES.



   A.   Zoning District allowed uses and corresponding requirements for
entitlements are listed in Table 17.20.030-1 (Allowed Uses and Required
Entitlements) for all of the city's base zoning districts.  Generally, a use
is either allowed by right, allowed through issuance of a conditional use
permit, or not permitted.  In addition to the requirements for planning
entitlements of this title, other permits may be required prior to
establishment of the use (e.g., Building Permit or permits required by other
agencies). 



   B.   The requirements for planning entitlements identified in Table
17.20.030-1 include:



      1.   Permitted (P).  A land use shown with a “P”
indicates that the land use is permitted by right in the designated zoning
district, subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning
Code (e.g., development standards) as well state and federal law.



      2.   Conditional (C).  A land use shown with a “C”
indicates that the land use is permitted in the designated zoning district
upon issuance of a conditional use permit from the designated approving
authority, subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Zoning Code (e.g., development standards) as well state and federal law.



      3.   Not Permitted (N).  A land use shown with an “N” in
the table is not allowed in the applicable zoning district.  Additionally,
uses not shown in the table are not permitted, except as otherwise provided
for in this title. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.18.070  SIMILAR USE DETERMINATION.



   A.   When a use is not specifically listed in this title, it shall
be understood that the use may be permitted if the Community Development
Director determines that the use is substantially similar to other uses
listed.  It is further recognized that every use cannot be identified in
this title and, anticipating that new uses will evolve over time, this
section establishes the Community Development Director 's authority to
compare a proposed use and measure it against those uses listed in this title
for determining similarity. 



   B.   In determining “similarity” the Community Development
Director shall make all of the following findings:



      1.   The characteristics of, and activities associated with
the proposed use are equivalent to one (1) or more of the listed uses, and
will not involve a higher level of activity or population density than the
uses listed in the district;



      2.   The proposed use will be consistent with the purposes of
the applicable zoning district; and



      3.   The proposed use will be consistent with the general plan.



   C.   Determinations shall be made in writing and shall contain the
facts that support the determination.  The department shall maintain all
such determinations on record at the public counter for review by the general
public.  All recorded determinations shall be provided to the Planning
Commission, City Council, City Manager, City Attorney, and City Clerk.  The
Community Development Director's decision may be appealed as provided in
Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).  Interpretations shall be made consistent with
the provisions outlined in Chapter 17.06 (Interpretations). (Ord. 2010-02 §
1 (part), 2010)

   Table 17.20.030-1 below identifies allowed uses and corresponding
requirements for planning entitlements for all base zoning districts within
the city. Definitions for the land uses listed herein (use classifications)
are provided in Chapter 17.22 (Allowed Use Definitions).  See additional use
requirements in Article IV (Special Use Standards). In the table below, any
land use shown with a “P” indicates that the land use is permitted by
right, a “C” indicates that the land use is permitted in the designated
zoning district upon issuance of a conditional use permit (pursuant to
Section 17.12.140 (Conditional Use Permit), a “P” indicates that the land
use is permitted in the designated zoning district upon issuance of an
administrative use permit (pursuant to Section 17.12.060 (Administrative Use
Permit), and an “N” indicates that the use is not allowed. Except as
otherwise provided for in this title, uses not shown in the table are not
permitted.  Zoning district names for the zoning district symbols used in

general categories on the basis of common function, product, or compatibility
characteristics. This chapter should be used as a reference to Additional

screening shall be maintained in a healthy and vigorous condition. Areas used
as vegetative screening shall not be counted as open space.  (Ord. 2010-02

SPECIAL PURPOSE ZONING DISTRICTS



Sections:



   17.26.010   Purpose.



   17.26.020   Specific Plan (SP) Zoning District.



   17.26.030   Planned Development (PD) zoning districts.



17.26.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to identify all special purpose
districts within the city.  Special purpose districts require special
project entitlement, which allows for flexibility from traditional
development standards. These districts are consistent with and implement the
city's general plan special planning land use designation as shown in Table
17.24.020-1 (Zoning Districts).  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.26.020  SPECIFIC PLAN (SP) ZONING DISTRICT.



   A.   Purpose of the Specific Plan Zoning District.  The purpose of
the specific plan zoning district is to designate unique planning areas
within the city for which the City Council has adopted or requires adoption
of a separate planning document (a specific plan) consistent with the general
plan and state law.  The contents, requirements, and adoption and amendment
procedures for specific plans are listed in Section 17.12.170 (Specific
Plans).



   B.   Designation.  Specific plan zoning districts shall be
delineated on the zoning map in a manner similar to that of any other zoning
district except that each specific plan-zoned area shall also bear a name,
number, symbol, or other delineation, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, which distinguishes it from other specific plan zoning
districts, base zoning districts, or overlay zoning districts.  The
assignment of the specific plan zoning district serves to provide a reference
to the corresponding specific plan zoning document adopted by ordinance of
the City Council.  Applicable zoning regulations and standards applicable to
the land area shall be provided in the specific plan document, and shall be
adopted by reference in this title.



   C.   Allowed Uses.  Allowed uses within the specific plan area are
those listed uses in the adopted specific plan document as permitted,
conditionally permitted, or not permitted.



   D.   Development Standards.  Development standards within the
specific plan area are those standards listed in the adopted specific plan. 
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.26.030  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT (PD) ZONING DISTRICTS.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of a planned development district is to
encourage and provide the means for promoting desirable development in the
city which may be characterized by variations in siting, mixed land use,
mixed housing types and integrated design techniques which result in
complementing surrounding uses. The planned development district allows
diverse building setbacks, lot size and building height while complying with
the intent of the general plan and development standards necessary to ensure
the requirement of public health, safety and general welfare.  By enacting
the 2010 Comprehensive Zoning Code update, it is the intent of the city to
recognize PD-Planned Development zoning districts adopted before the update,
but after the update, to use other mechanisms instead of PD zoning to
implement flexible zoning standards.



   B.   Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to property
zoned PD-Planned Development as of the effective date  of this title. 
Existing PD zoning may be amended but no new PD-Planned Development zoning
shall be approved after the effective date of this title.



   C.   Relation to Existing PD Zoned Sites. 



      1.   Continued effect.  The ordinances applying PD zoning to
affected sites shall continue in effect until amended or the site is rezoned
to another district.



      2.   Other zoning regulations.  Except as specifically
provided in the applicable PD ordinance, all development in the PD-Planned
Development district site shall be subject to the regulations of the closest
comparable zoning district as determined by the Community Development
Director, and of this title.



   D.   Amendments to Existing PD Zoning.  The Community Development
Director by administrative action may approve minor amendments to an adopted
PD-Planned Development zoning upon a finding that the amendment substantially
complies with and does not otherwise materially change the provisions or
intent of the PD ordinance for the site. All other amendments to the adopted
PD ordinance for a site shall be pursuant to the procedures in Section
17.12.190 (Zoning Code (Text and Map) Amendment).



   E.   Findings for approval of PD Zoning Amendments.  In addition to
any findings required in Section 17.12.190 (Zoning Code (Text and Map)
Amendment), amendments to a PD ordinance shall require any findings that were
required for the original PD ordinance.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

   17.30.020   Applicability.



   17.30.030   Permit requirements and exemptions.



   17.30.040   Development standards.



17.30.010  PURPOSE.



   This chapter defines detached accessory structures on private property
and establishes development standards for nonexempt structures. The purpose
of this chapter is to protect public health, safety and welfare by
maintaining safe distances between structures, establishing architectural
compatibility between primary structures and certain types of accessory
structures, and minimizing potential impacts associated with lot coverage,
privacy, and maintenance of light and air space.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part),
2010)



17.30.020  APPLICABILITY.



   The requirements contained in this chapter shall apply to accessory
structures on private property and shall be in addition to any other
development standards contained elsewhere within the Zoning Code (e.g.,
lighting). Generally, this chapter regulates detached accessory structures
that are larger than one hundred and twenty (120) square feet in size and/or
taller than eight (8) feet in height. For the purposes of this title, second
dwelling units are not considered accessory structures; second dwelling units
are governed by the requirements of Chapter 17.70 (Second Dwelling Units) and
are exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Accessory structures shall
not contain cooking facilities or bathrooms or be used as a dwelling unit or
accessory dwelling unit. Guest houses and pool houses that conform to the
requirements of this chapter are considered accessory structures and not
second dwelling units.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.30.030  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS.



   A.   Permit Requirements. Except as otherwise exempt in Section
17.70.030B, accessory structures located in single-family and two (2)-family
zoning districts require plan check as described in Section 17.12.030 (Plan
Check). When located in multi-family, mixed-use, and non-residential zoning
districts, non-exempt accessory structures require comprehensive design
review as described in Section 17.12.150 (Comprehensive Design Review).



   B.   Exemptions. The following accessory structures are exempt from
planning entitlements provided they comply with listed requirements. Exempt
accessory structures may require ministerial building permits in keeping with
the uniform building codes adopted by the City of Pinole.



      1.   Enclosed and/or solid-roofed accessory structures that
are less than one hundred and twenty (120) square feet in size with no
portion of the structure equal to or greater than eight (8) feet in height
and subject to compliance with the following requirements.



         a.   Accessory structures shall not be located in a
required front yard.



         b.   In order to maintain necessary fire breaks, all
combustible accessory structures shall be set back a minimum of three (3)
feet from side and rear property lines with a minimum six (6)-foot separation
between any structures.



      2.   Landscape features that are less than one hundred and
twenty (120) square feet in size with no portion of the feature equal to or
greater than eight (8) feet in height and subject to compliance with the
following requirement.



         a.   In order to maintain necessary fire breaks,
combustible landscape features shall be set back a minimum of three (3) feet
from all interior property lines with a minimum six (6)-foot separation
between any structures.



      3.   Play equipment. Structures and surfaces used for
recreational purposes including play structures, jungle gyms, and
non-illuminated sports courts such as tennis and basketball courts.



      4.   Deck/patio. A detached porch or platform that is
generally constructed with wood, concrete or stone that is above the grade or
located over a basement or story below.



      5.   Pool/spa. Any structure intended for swimming or
recreational bathing. Swimming pool includes in-ground and above-ground
structures and includes, but is not limited to, hot tubs, spas, portable
spas, and non-portable wading pools.



      6.   Consistent with Chapter 17.72, solar facilities are
exempt from regulations such as setback, size, and location unless the
Building Official has determined that the placement therein will have a
specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, as defined in state
law.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.30.040  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   A.   Development Standards for All Accessory Structures. The
development standards listed in Table 17.30.040-1 (Development Standards for
Accessory Structures) are intended to supplement the requirements in the
applicable zoning district for types of accessory structures as defined in
Article VI (Glossary) of this title. Figure 17.30.040-1 shows minimum setback
measurements for a typical detached accessory structure. In the event of a
conflict between these requirements and the underlying zoning district
regulations, the requirements of this Section shall apply. The following
requirements shall apply to all accessory structures, both exempt and
nonexempt under Section 17.20.030.



      1.   Setback measurement. Minimum setback distances for
accessory structures from property lines and between all structures shall
include all portions of the structure(s) (e.g., overhangs, projections,
railings) for the purpose of compliance with minimum structural fire breaks.
See Figure 17.30.040-1 (Setback Measurements for Accessory Structures).



      2.   Construction phasing. Accessory structures may be
constructed in conjunction with or subsequent to (but not in advance of)
construction of the primary building(s) on the site. Exceptions may be
granted in agricultural and residential zoning districts where accessory
structures may be constructed prior to the primary residential dwelling.

17.32.010  PURPOSE.



   This chapter establishes policies, incentives, design standards, and
alternative methods of compliance for meeting the city's affordable housing
needs. The purpose of this chapter is to promote achievement of the city's
general plan housing element goals for affordable housing. The policies
outlined in this chapter regulate the method of determining the minimum
requirements. Further, this chapter identifies the administrative procedures
related to affordable housing requests.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.020  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.



   Consistent with the City of Pinole general plan housing element, the
city requires the designation of land for affordable housing to meet the
city's future housing needs. The requirements of this chapter shall be
governed by the requirements of the Community Redevelopment Law (California
Health & Safety Code Section 33000 et.seq.), as that statute is amended from
time-to-time. Where conflict occurs between the requirements of this chapter
and state law, state law shall govern. General requirements are listed below:



   A.   General Requirement. For all rental or ownership residential
developments of four (4) or more dwelling units located in the City, at least
fifteen percent (15%) of the total units must be constructed and offered for
sale or rent as an affordable housing unit. Of those units, forty percent
(40%) must be affordable to very low income households. For example, a
proposed residential development for twenty (20) single-family homes must
provide three (3) affordable housing units, two (2) of which are affordable
to very low income households. Existing units that are to be retained shall
be included in the number of units in the residential development for purpose
of calculating the number of affordable housing units required by this
chapter.



   B.   Residential Parcel Maps and Subdivisions. For all residential
subdivisions within or outside of the city's redevelopment area where the
lots to be approved would permit the eventual development of four (4) or more
dwelling units, the applicant shall propose an alternative method of
compliance to meet the affordable housing requirements, pursuant to the
requirements as established in Section 17.32.060 (Alternative Methods of
Compliance).



   C.   Density Bonus Units. Any additional units approved as a density
bonus under Chapter 17.38 (Density Bonus) will not be counted in determining
the required number of affordable housing units. For example, a proposed
project with twenty (20) units that receives a twenty-five percent (25%)
density bonus of five (5) units will calculate the affordable housing
requirements based on twenty (20) units and must provide three (3) affordable
housing units, two (2) of which are affordable to very low income households.



   D.   Rounding. In determining the number of affordable housing units
required by this chapter, any decimal fraction shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole number.



   E.   Price Limits for Affordable Housing Units. Affordable housing
units must be restricted for sale at affordable prices as identified in Table
17.32.020-1 below:



TABLE 17.32.020-1
PRICE LIMITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS

(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.030  EXEMPTIONS.



   The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to the following types
of development projects:



   A.   Manufactured Homes.



   B.   Pending Complete Applications. A project which has submitted an
application for approval, which application was deemed complete by the
Community Development Director prior to the effective date of this title.



   C.   Casualty Reconstruction Projects. The reconstruction of any
residential units or structures which have been destroyed by fire, flood,
earthquake, or other act of nature, which are being reconstructed in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Chapter 17.14 (Nonconforming Uses and
Structures). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.040  INCENTIVES FOR ON-SITE HOUSING.



   A.   In the Affordable Housing Plan that is prepared and approved in
accordance with Section 17.32.070 (Affordable Housing Plan Processing), the
applicant shall identify the incentives or modifications requested and
describe the exceptional circumstances that necessitate assistance from the
city, as well as provide documentation of how such incentives increase the
feasibility of providing affordable housing. Incentives will be offered only
to the extent resources for this purpose are available and approved for such
use by the City Council, as defined below, and to the extent that the
project, with the use of incentives, assists in achieving the city's housing
goals. Nothing in this chapter establishes, directly or through implication,
a right of an applicant to receive any incentive from the city.



   B.   The following incentives may be approved for applicants who
construct affordable housing units on-site:



      1.   Density Bonus. Consistent with California Government Code
Sections 65915 through 65918, qualifying projects can receive a density bonus
by right. Density bonus requirements are outlined in Chapter 17.38 (Density
Bonus) of this code.



      2.   Fee Subsidy or Deferral. The City Council, by resolution,
may subsidize or defer payment of city development impact fees and/or
building permit fees applicable to the affordable housing units or the
project of which they are a part. The affordability control covenant shall
include the terms of the fee subsidy or deferral.



      3.   Design Modifications. The granting of design
modifications relative to affordable housing requirements shall require
approval of the City Council and shall meet all applicable zoning
requirements of the city. Modifications to typical development standards may
include the following:



         a.   Reduced minimum setbacks;



         b.   Reduced minimum building separation requirements;



         c.   Reduced square footage requirements;



         d.   Reduced parking requirements;



         e.   Reduced minimum lot sizes and/or dimensions;



         f.   Reduced street standards (e.g., reduced minimum
street widths);



         g.   Reduced on-site open space requirements;



         h.   Increased height limitations;



         i.   Increased maximum lot coverage;



         j.   Increased floor area ratio;



         k.   Allowance for live-work units within multi-family
residential zoning districts;



         l.   In lieu of reduced setbacks, allowance for attached
dwelling units, if shown to be necessary to make the project feasible; or



         m.   Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed
by the developer or the city that result in identifiable, financially
sufficient, and actual cost reductions.



         n.   Priority Processing. After receiving the required
discretionary approvals, the residential development that provides affordable
housing units may be entitled to priority processing of building and
engineering approvals, subject to the approval of the City Manager. (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.050  AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.



   Affordable housing units constructed pursuant to this chapter must
conform to the following requirements:



   A.   Design. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
affordable housing units shall be integrated within and reasonably dispersed
throughout the project and shall be comparable in infrastructure (including
sewer, water, and other utilities), construction quality, exterior design,
and materials to the market-rate units. Affordable housing units may have
different interior finishes and features than market-rate units so long as
the interior features are durable, of good quality, and consistent with
contemporary standards for new housing as determined by the Community
Development Director.



   B.   Size. All affordable housing units shall reflect the range and
numbers of bedrooms provided in the project as a whole, except that
affordable housing units need not provide more than four (4) bedrooms.



   C.   Availability. All affordable housing units shall be constructed
concurrently with and be made available for qualified occupants at the same
time as the market-rate units within the same project unless the city and
developer agree in the Affordable Housing Agreement to an alternative
schedule for development.



   D.   Affordable Housing Agreement. An Affordable Housing Agreement
shall be made a condition of the discretionary planning entitlements for all
qualifying projects granted a density bonus, fee subsidy, fee deferral, or
design modifications. The Affordable Housing Agreement shall include an
affordable housing plan and shall be reviewed and approved by the City
Council.



   E.   Duration of Affordability Requirement. Affordable housing units
produced under this chapter must be legally restricted to occupancy by
households of the income levels for which the units were designated pursuant
to and in conformance with the requirements of this title, any other
applicable city regulation, and state law. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.060  ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMPLIANCE.



   A.   Applicant Proposals. If it is not practical to construct
on-site affordable housing units, the city will consider alternatives of
equal value. Accordingly, the applicant may propose an alternative means of
compliance with this chapter by submitting to the city an affordable housing
plan. One (1) alternative the applicant may consider is the construction of
affordable housing units, subject to the requirements listed below:



      1.   Off-site construction. All or some of the required
affordable housing units may be constructed off-site if the Planning
Commission (or City Council on appeal) finds that the combination of
location, unit size, unit type, pricing, and timing of availability of the
proposed off-site affordable housing units would provide equivalent or
greater benefit than would result from providing those affordable housing
units on-site as might otherwise be required by this chapter. Prior to the
recordation of the final subdivision map for the proposed residential
development, the applicant shall post a bond, bank letter of credit, or other
security acceptable to the Community Development Director, in the amount
equivalent to the cost of land and improvements for the affordable housing
units, as determined by the Community Development Director, to be used by the
city to meet the goals of providing affordable housing in the city in the
event that the off-site affordable housing units are not completed (as
evidenced by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for such units)
according to the schedule stated in the affordable housing plan submitted by
the applicant.



   B.   Discretion and Required Finding. The Planning Commission (or
City Council on appeal) may approve, conditionally approve, or reject any
alternative proposed by an applicant as part of an affordable housing plan.
Any approval or conditional approval must be based on a finding that the
purpose of this chapter would be better served by implementation of the
proposed alternative, in which the Planning Commission or City Council should
consider the extent to which other factors affect the feasibility of prompt
construction of the affordable housing units, such as site design, zoning,
infrastructure, clear title, grading, and environmental review.



(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.070  AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN PROCESSING.



   A.   General. The submittal of an affordable housing plan and
recordation of an approved city affordable control covenant shall be a
precondition on the city approval of any Final Subdivision Map, and no
building permit shall be issued for any development to which this chapter
applies without full compliance with the requirement of this section. This
section shall not apply to exempt projects.



   B.   Affordable Housing Plan. Every residential development to which
this chapter applies shall include an affordable housing plan as part of the
application submittal for either development plan approval or subdivision
approval. No application for a tentative map, subdivision map, or building
permit for a development to which this chapter applies may be deemed
completed until an affordable housing plan is submitted to and approved by
the Community Development Director as being complete. At any time during the
formal development review process, the Community Development Director may
require from the applicant additional information reasonably necessary to
clarify and supplement the application or determine the consistency of the
project's proposed affordable housing plan with the requirements of this
chapter.



   C.   Required Plan Elements. An affordable housing plan must include
the following elements or submittal requirements:



      1.   The number, location, structure (attached, semi-attached,
or detached), and size (bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage) of the
proposed market-rate and affordable housing units and the basis for
calculating the number of affordable housing units.



      2.   A floor or site plan depicting the location of the
affordable housing units and the market-rate units.



      3.   The income levels to which each affordable housing unit
will be made affordable.



      4.   The term of affordability for the affordable housing
units.



      5.   The methods to be used to advertise the availability of
the affordable housing units and the procedures for qualifying and selecting
the eligible purchasers and/or tenants, including preference to be given, if
any, to applicants who live or work in the city.



      6.   A schedule for completion and occupancy of the affordable
housing units. For phased development, a phasing plan that provides for the
timely development of the number of affordable housing units proportionate to
each proposed phase of development.



      7.   A description of any incentives or modifications as
listed in Section 17.32.040 (Incentives for On-Site Housing) including a
description of exceptional circumstances that necessitate assistance from the
city, as well as documentation of how such incentives increase the
feasibility of providing affordable housing.



      8.   Any alternative means, as designated in Section
17.32.060.A, proposed for the development along with information necessary to
support the findings required by Section 17.32.060.B for approval of such
alternatives.



      9.   Any other information reasonably requested by the
Community Development Director to assist with evaluation of the affordable
housing plan under the requirements of this chapter.



   D.   Affordability Control Covenants. Prior to issuance of a grading
permit or building permit, whichever is requested first, a standard City
affordability control covenant must be approved and executed by the Community
Development Director, executed by the applicant/owners, and recorded against
the title of each affordable housing unit. If subdivision into individual
property parcels has not been finalized at the time of issuance of a grading
permit or building permit, an overall interim affordability control covenant
shall be recorded against the residential development and shall be replaced
by separate recorded affordability control covenants for each unit prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the city for such units. The
affordability control covenants must identify any incentives, modifications,
or terms of any fee waiver, as permitted pursuant to Chapter 17.38 (Density
Bonus), approved by the city. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.080  ELIGIBILITY.



   A.   General Eligibility for Affordable Housing Units. No household
may purchase, rent, or occupy an affordable housing unit unless the city has
approved the household's eligibility, and the household and city have
executed and recorded an affordability control covenant in the chain of title
of the affordable housing unit. Such affordability control covenant is in
addition to the covenant required in Section 17.32.070.D.



   B.   Owner Occupancy. A household which purchases an affordable
housing unit must occupy that unit as a principal residence, as that term is
defined for federal tax purposes by the United States Internal Revenue Code.
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.090  ADJUSTMENTS.



   A.   Adjustments. The requirements of this chapter may be adjusted
to propose an alternative method of compliance with the chapter in accordance
with Section 17.32.060 (Alternative Methods of Compliance) by the city if the
applicant demonstrates to the Planning Commission (or the City Council on
appeal) that applying the requirement of this chapter would be contrary to
the requirements of the laws or the constitutions of the United States or
California.



   B.   Timing of Waiver Request. To receive an adjustment or waiver,
the applicant must make an initial request of the Planning Commission for
such an adjustment or waiver and provide an appropriate demonstration of the
appropriateness of the adjustment or waiver when first applying to the
Planning Commission for the review and approval of the proposed development
plan or subdivision review as such review and approval is required by the
City of Pinole Municipal Code.



   C.   Waiver and Adjustment Considerations. In making a determination
on an application to adjust or waive the requirements of this chapter, the
Planning Commission (or City Council on appeal) may assume each of the
following when applicable:



      1.   That the applicant is subject to the affordable housing
requirements of Chapter 17.32 (Affordable Housing Requirements);



      2.   The extent to which the applicant will benefit from
affordable housing incentives under Section 17.32.040 (Incentives for On-Site
Housing); and



      3.   That the applicant will be obligated to provide the most
economical affordable housing units feasible in terms of construction,
design, location, and tenure, and subject to the requirements of Chapter
17.32 (Affordable Housing Requirements). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.32.100  SEVERABILITY.



   If any provision of this section or its application to any property is
held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, invalidity shall
not affect other provisions in this section that may be implemented without
the invalid sections. To this end, the provisions and clauses of this section
are declared severable. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



CHAPTER 17.34
AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATIONS



Sections:



   17.34.010   Purpose.



   17.34.020   Applicability.



   17.34.030   Permit requirements and conditions of approval.



   17.34.040   Location requirements.



   17.34.050   Development and design standards.



   17.34.060   Alternative fuel and charging stations for electric
vehicles.



17.34.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate service station development
to ensure that the design and operation of such uses are compatible with
surrounding uses and activities relative to hazardous materials, noise,
circulation, runoff, lighting, and litter. This chapter is also intended to
allow for expansion of existing service stations to allow for biodiesel and
other alternative fuels and the incorporation of charging stations for
electric vehicles. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.34.020  APPLICABILITY.



   The regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to new service
stations. Service stations subject to this chapter shall only be authorized
through entitlement requirements of Article II. (Zoning Districts, Allowed
Uses, and Development Standards). These regulations shall be in addition to
any other development standards and regulations contained elsewhere within
the Zoning Code (e.g., lighting). Existing service stations and modification
to existing service stations are exempt from the regulations contained in
this chapter. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.34.030  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.



   A.   Permit Requirement. Service stations require a conditional use
permit or are allowed by right as established in Article II (Zoning
Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards). Comprehensive design
review pursuant to Section 17.12.150 (Comprehensive Design Review) shall be
required for all new service stations. Consistent with Article II. (Zoning
Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Services), the Planning Commission
is the designated approving authority for service station conditional use
permit applications.



   B.   Conditions of Approval. In addition to any other conditions
which may be imposed by the approving authority, any conditional use permit
issued pursuant to this chapter shall include the following conditions:



      1.   If the operation of the service station is discontinued
for any reason for a continuous period in excess of one hundred and eighty
(180) days, such discontinuance of operation shall be grounds for revocation
or modification of the conditional use permit, consistent with Section
17.16.070 (Permit Revocation or Modification).



      2.   Upon revocation of the conditional use permit, the
applicant shall remove all buildings, pumps, pump islands, signs, underground
storage tanks, fences, walls, and all other structures and instruments
related to the service station and shall return the property to substantially
the condition it was in prior to the construction of the service station.



      3.   The applicant to whom a conditional use permit has been
granted shall keep on the premises the conditional use permit or a copy
thereof.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.34.040  LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Abutting Residential Zoning Districts or Uses. No new service
stations shall be permitted or located on lots abutting property in any
residential zoning district or residential use, unless the designated
approving authority can make the finding that the design and operation of the
service station, along with the conditions placed upon the conditional use
permit or Design Review, will ensure compatibility with the abutting property
or use. In the event that the property adjacent to an existing service
station is subsequently rezoned to a residential zoning district or to allow
residential uses, such rezoning shall not cause the service station to be
nonconforming in regard to this location requirement.



   B.   Proximity to Other Service Stations. In the City of Pinole, a
maximum of two (2) service stations are permitted at any single intersection;
otherwise, service stations shall be separated by a minimum of five hundred
(500) feet. However, the city may grant exceptions for stations that are
required to relocate due to roadway expansion projects. Separation distance
shall be measured in a straight line from the property line of said service
stations. Where two (2) service stations are located at a single
intersection, the city encourages stations to be sited in such a manner as to
service different flows of traffic. The city may waive the spacing
requirements for infill sites or locations affected by roadway widening or
other infrastructure improvements. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.34.050  DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS.



   The following requirements apply to all new service stations and
qualifying expansions/improvements to existing service stations. Service
station uses shall also comply with all applicable state and federal
regulations regarding site design, pricing signs, containment, maintenance,
and operations.



   A.   Frontage. The minimum public street frontage shall be one
hundred and thirty-five (135) feet on each public street for all new service
stations.



   B.   Pump Islands. Service station pump islands may be placed in
required yards provided they are no closer than fifteen (15) feet to the
street right-of-way.



   C.   Setbacks. Generally, no building shall be located within thirty
(30) feet of any public right-of-way or within fifteen (15) feet of any
interior parcel line. However, to encourage a more pedestrian streetscape, a
primary building with direct access from the street may be located a minimum
of fifteen (15) feet from the right-of-way (and outside required landscape
corridors).



   D.   Building Placement and Orientation. Buildings shall be placed
outside the required setback areas, but close to the street and oriented to
the public view.



   E.   Building and Canopy Design. The service station building and/or
canopy shall be designed for architectural compatibility with the surrounding
area. Notwithstanding any other requirements in the Zoning Code, the maximum
height for all service station buildings (including canopy) shall be
twenty-five (25) feet. Pitched roofs are preferred, but not required. In
order to reduce the visual impact of the canopy structure and corresponding
lighting, the maximum height of the canopy clearance shall be fifteen (15)
feet and the maximum width of the canopy fascia shall be thirty (30) inches.
A lighting study shall be required in conjunction with the design review
process to examine light pollution issues, including but not limited to
safety and glare pursuant to Chapter 17.46 (Lighting). The canopy fascia
shall match the color and texture of the primary building. See Figure
17.34.050-1 (Service Station Building and Canopy Design). Deviations from
these requirements may be allowed in conjunction with comprehensive design
review (Section 17.12.150).

      1.   Driveway dimensions. Driveway design shall be consistent
with the City of Pinole Public Works Improvement Standards, except that the
minimum width for driveways shall be thirty-five (35) feet. The width shall
be expanded to forty-five (45) feet whenever the driveway accesses a street
with a width of, or with a planned ultimate width of, eighty-four (84) feet
or greater. The throat depth for driveways shall be fifty (50) feet.



      2.   Driveway location. Driveways shall be no closer than
forty (40) feet from the nearest intersecting point of street right-of-way
lines, or as otherwise determined by the Public Works Director for traffic
safety.



      3.   Number of driveways. No more than two (2) exterior points
of access (driveways along abutting streets) shall be provided for each
service station, regardless of the length or number of street frontages. No
more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the street frontage shall be devoted
to curb cuts. Within integrated developments, shared access driveways are
preferred.



      4.   Accommodation of vehicle stacking. The internal
circulation system shall allow for vehicle stacking without blocking ingress
and egress on and off the site. The pump island shall be situated to provide
stacking space for a minimum of two (2) vehicles behind the vehicle parked at
the pump closest to the entrance and/or exit driveway. Sites shall be
designed so that the space intended for vehicle stacking shall not block or
interfere with the general circulation of traffic within integrated
developments.



   G.   Accommodation of Refueling Trucks. The internal circulation
system shall allow for safe and efficient fuel delivery. Turning radius
information for all fuel delivery trucks accessing the service station shall
be provided in conjunction with conditional use permit or design review for
review and approval to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director.



   H.   Landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided consistent with the
requirements of Section 17.44.060 (Special Landscape Requirements) for
service stations.



   I.   Signs. Signs shall be consistent with the requirements of
Chapter 17.52 (Signs), including exempt gasoline pricing signs.



   J.   Fences and Walls. A wall shall be provided between service
stations abutting property in any agricultural or residential zoning district
or residential use consistent with the requirements of Section 17.42.050
(Special Fence, Wall and Screening Requirements).



   K.   Lighting. In addition to the lighting requirements of Chapter
17.46 (Lighting), canopy lighting shall be recessed so that the luminary does
not extend below the surface of the underside of the canopy.



   L.   Noise. All outdoor noise generators associated with operation
of the service station shall be identified by the applicant during the
conditional use permit and/or comprehensive design review process and may
require the submittal of a professional noise analysis to quantify noise
sources and attenuate noise levels consistent with city noise standards. All
outdoor speakers and video/audio pump stations and sound signals associated
with the service stations shall be turned off daily between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.34.060  ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND CHARGING STATIONS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES.



   Plan check is required pursuant to Section 17.12.030 (Plan Check) for
the expansion, modification or retrofit of an existing service station where
the expansion, modification or retrofit incorporates biodiesel or other
alternative fuels, or charging stations for electric vehicles. The designated
approving authority may grant the expansion, modification or retrofit even if
specified improvements result in a reduction of existing on-site parking.

CHAPTER 17.36
BUILDING HEIGHT MEASUREMENT AND PROJECTIONS



Sections:



   17.36.010   Purpose.



   17.36.020   Height regulations.



   17.36.030   Height measurement.



   17.36.040   Height exceptions.



17.36.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the regulation for building
height and rules for measuring building height. Additionally, the chapter
includes exceptions to the height requirements of the underlying zoning
district based on use type and features. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.36.020  HEIGHT REGULATIONS.



   The regulations provided in this chapter establish the methodology that
shall be used for measuring the height of all structures regulated by the
Zoning Code. The maximum allowed height for all structures varies by type of
structure and zoning district, and is identified in multiple locations in the
Zoning Code, including Article II (Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses, and
Development Standards), Chapter 17.30 (Accessory Structures), and Chapter
17.42 (Fences, Walls and Screening). The height requirements for buildings or
structures shall be interpreted so that the limitation as to the number of
stories and the limitation of the height in feet shall apply when both
requirements are listed.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.36.030  HEIGHT MEASUREMENT.



   The height of a structure shall be measured as the vertical distance
from the natural grade of the site to an imaginary plane located the allowed
number of feet above and parallel to the grade. See Figure
17.36.030-1(Measurement of Height).

(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.36.040  HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS.



   Exceptions to the height regulations provided elsewhere in the Zoning
Code are identified below.



   A.   General Building Height Exceptions Allowed Through Design
Review. As part of administrative design review (Section 17.12.080) or
comprehensive design review (Section 17.12.150), the designated approving
authority may allow multi-family dwellings, schools, religious facilities,
public buildings, and other similar buildings or structures to be erected to
a height not to exceed seventy-five (75) feet, provided that the required
yards are increased one (1) foot for each one (1) foot of height increase of
said building over the maximum height limit allowed by the zoning district
that applies to said building.



   B.   Solar Facilities. Solar facilities are allowed to exceed the
height limits of the applicable zoning district, unless the Building
Official, in the approval of the building permit, has determined that the
placement therein will have a specific adverse impact upon the public health
or safety, as defined by state law.



   C.   Residential Zoning Districts. Chimneys, cupolas, towers, and
other similar architectural projections not exceeding a dimension of six (6)
feet at their base may exceed the height limits of the applicable zoning
district by a maximum of five (5) feet.



   D.   Non-Residential and Mixed Use Zoning Districts.



      1.   Minor projections. Minor projections for the purpose of
shelter for mechanical equipment, elevator and mechanical equipment
enclosures, radio or television antennas, and similar structures and
necessary mechanical appurtenances may be erected on a building to exceed the
height limits of the applicable zoning district, or of that use, by a maximum
of fifteen (15) feet, provided the projections are screened by a parapet or
pitched roof or other method acceptable to the Community Development Director.



      2.   Architectural features. Clock towers, cupolas, towers,
and similar structures may exceed the height limit as listed below. Signs
shall not be included within the additional height allowed.



         a.   Up to twenty (20) feet, if located at a street
intersection.



         b.   Up to twelve (12) feet, it located midblock. These
features shall not exceed a width of twenty-five (25) feet or one-third (1/3)
of the length of the building façade, whichever is less.



      3.   Mixed-use and industrial zoning districts. As part of
administrative design review (Section 17.12.080) or comprehensive design
review (Section 17.12.150), the designated approving authority may permit the
maximum height for buildings in the mixed-use and industrial zoning districts
to be increased provided that all portions of the building exceeding the
otherwise applicable height maximum are set back from the ultimate
right-of-way line of all abutting streets and freeways a distance at least
equal to the height of that portion of the building. For any residential
portion of a hotel or a residential portion of a mixed-use development, all
required yards and courts shall be increased one (1) square foot for each
foot that such building exceeds the otherwise applicable maximum height of
the zoning district. In any case, the floor area to lot area ratio shall not
exceed that allowed in the applicable zoning district or 2.5:1 when no
maximum is specified.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

   17.38.090   Administrative fee.



17.38.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide incentives for the production
of housing for very low income, lower income, moderate income, special needs,
and senior households in the city and to establish procedures for carrying
out the legislative requirements and complying with California Government
Code Section 65915, et seq. In enacting this chapter, it is the intent of the
city to facilitate the development of affordable housing by positively
impacting the economic feasibility of providing lower income housing and
implementing the goals, objectives, and policies of the city's housing
element.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.38.020  ELIGIBILITY FOR DENSITY BONUS AND INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS.



   The city shall grant one (1) density bonus, with concessions or
incentives, as specified in Section 17.38.040 (number and types of density
bonuses and incentives and concessions allowed), when the applicant for the
residential development seeks and agrees to construct a residential
development, excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded
pursuant to this chapter, that will contain at least one (1) of the following:



   A.   Ten percent (10%) of the total units of a housing development
for lower income households;



   B.   Five percent (5%) of the total units of a housing development
for very low income households;



   C.   A senior citizen housing development or age-restricted mobile
home park; or



   D.   Ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units in a common
interest development as defined in California Civil Code Section 1351 for
persons and families of moderate income, provided that all units in the
development are offered to the public for purchase. The above units
qualifying a development for a density bonus shall be referred to as
“target units.” The applicant shall specify which of the above paragraphs
the basis for the density bonus is. The percentage of total units proposed to
qualify the development for a density bonus shall not be rounded up. Example:
for a two hundred (200)-unit project that proposes twenty-one (21) lower
income units (or 10.5%), the allowed density bonus would be based on ten
percent (10%) lower income units, not eleven (11%).



(Ord. 2016-04 § 8 (part), 2016: Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.38.030  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   The following general requirements apply to the application and
determination of all incentives and bonuses:



   A.   Rounding. All density calculations resulting in fractional
units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.



   B.   Relation to General Plan, Zoning. The granting of a density
bonus, or a concession or incentive, shall not be interpreted, in and of
itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other
discretionary approval.



   C.   Density Bonus Excluded in Calculation. The density bonus shall
not be included when calculating the total number of housing units that
qualifies the housing development for a density bonus.



   D.   Parking. Upon request by the applicant, the city shall not
require that a housing development meeting the requirements of Section
17.38.020 (Eligibility for Density Bonus and Incentives and Concessions)
provide a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest
parking, that exceeds the following:



      1.   Zero (studio) to one (1) bedroom: one (1) on-site parking
space per unit;



      2.   Two (2) to three (3) bedrooms: two (2) on-site parking
spaces per unit;



      3.   Four (4) or more bedrooms: two and one-half (2 1/2)
parking spaces per unit;



      4.   If the total of parking spaces required for a housing
development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to
the next whole number. For purposes of this subsection, a development may
provide “on-site parking” through tandem parking or uncovered parking,
but not through on-street parking.



   E.   Waived or Reduced Development Standards.



      1.   The city shall not apply any development standard that
would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a housing
development meeting the requirements of Section 17.38.020 (Eligibility for
Density Bonus and Incentives and Concessions) at the densities or with the
incentives or concessions permitted by this chapter.



      2.   An applicant may submit to the city a proposal for the
waiver or reduction of development standards, when standards would have the
effect of physically precluding the proposed development, and may request a
meeting with the city. Nothing in this section, however, shall be interpreted
to require the city to waive or reduce development standards if:



         a.   The waiver or reduction would have a specific
adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section
65589.5 of the California Government Code, upon health and safety or the
physical environment and for which the city determines there is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact; or



         b.   This would have an adverse impact on any real
property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.



         c.   The waiver or reduction would be contrary to state
or federal law.



      3.   A proposed waiver or reduction of development standards
shall neither reduce nor increase the number of allowable incentives or
concessions under Section 17.38.040.



   F.   Multiple Zoning Districts. If the site of a development
proposal is located in two (2) or more zoning districts, the number of
dwelling units permitted in the development is the sum of the dwelling units
permitted in each of the zoning districts based on the site acreage within
each zoning district. The permitted number of dwelling units may be
distributed within the development without regard to the zone boundaries.

granting of a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value
as the City finds appropriate, including but not limited to, conditions which
assure continued affordability of units to subsequent purchasers who are
persons and families of low and moderate income or lower income households.

levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income;
subject to any other form of rent or price control through the City's valid
exercise of its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income

following applies:



         a.   The proposed condominium project, inclusive of the
units replaced pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(c)(3)(B), contains
affordable units at the percentages set forth in Subsection (a) above.

17.38.050  LOCATION OF DENSITY BONUS UNITS.



   The location of density bonus units within the housing development may
be at the discretion of the developer. However, the target units shall be
dispersed throughout the housing development and when feasible shall contain,
on average, the same number of bedrooms as the non-target units in the
development, and shall be compatible with the design or use of the remaining
units in terms of appearance, materials, and quality finish.

17.38.060  CONTINUED AVAILABILITY.



   A.   If a housing development provides low or very low income target
rental units to qualify for a density bonus, the target units must remain
restricted to lower or very low income households for a minimum of fifty-five
(55) years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the
Building Official, or longer if required by the project financing.



   B.   In the case of all for-sale units that qualified the applicant
for the award of the density bonus, the initial occupant shall be persons and
families of very low, low, or moderate income households, as required. The
applicant shall enter into and the City shall enforce an equity sharing
agreement, unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public
funding source or law. The following requirements shall apply to the equity
sharing agreement:



      1.   Upon resale, the seller of the target units shall retain
the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's
proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture any initial
subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation which shall then be used
within five (5) years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of
Section 33334.2 of the California Health and Safety Code that promote
homeownership.



      2.   The city's initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair
market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale
price to the moderate income household, plus the amount of any down payment
assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower
than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall
be used as the initial market value.



      3.   The city's "proportionate share" shall be equal to the
ratio of the local government's initial subsidy to the fair market value of
the home at the time of the initial sale.



   C.   Sales price for for-sale affordable very low, low, and moderate
income units shall be set at affordable housing cost. Rents for affordable
low and very low income rental units shall be set at an affordable rent.



   D.   Unless otherwise governed by other funding sources, first
priority for the affordable units will be given to individuals who reside,
work, go to school, or have family in the City of Pinole.



   E.   The developer shall submit a project financial report (pro
forma) demonstrating that the requested incentives or concessions are
required to provide for affordable rents or affordable housing costs, as
applicable. The City may retain a consultant to review the financial report.
The cost of the consultant shall be borne by the developer with the following
exception:



      1.   If the applicant is a nonprofit organization, the cost of
the consultant may be paid by the City upon prior approval of the City
Council.



   F.   All affordable units shall be occupied by the household type
specified in the written agreement required under Section 17.38.030 I. The
developer's obligation to maintain these units as affordable housing shall be
evidenced by the master regulatory agreement which shall be recorded as deed
restriction running with the land.



   G.   Prior to the rental or sale of any affordable unit, the City or
its designee, shall verify the eligibility of the prospective tenant or buyer.



   H.   The City may establish fees associated with the setting up and
monitoring of affordable units.



   I.   For rental affordable very low and low income units:



      1.   The owner shall obtain and maintain on file
certifications by each household. Certification shall be obtained immediately
prior to initial occupancy by each household and annually thereafter, in the
form provided by the City or its designee. The owner shall obtain updated
forms for each household on request by the City, but in no event less
frequently than once a year. The owner shall maintain complete, accurate and
current records pertaining to the housing development, and shall permit any
duly authorized representative of the City to inspect the records pertaining
to the affordable units and occupants of these units.



      2.   The owner shall submit an annual report to the City, on a
form provided by the City. The report shall include for each affordable unit
the rent, income, and family size of the household occupying the unit.



      3.   The owner shall provide to the City any additional
information required by the City to insure the long-term affordability of the
affordable units by eligible households.

17.38.070  REQUIREMENT TO REPLACE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO QUALIFY FOR DENSITY
BONUS, INCENTIVE, OR CONCESSION.



   A.   An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any
other incentives or concessions under this Chapter if the housing development
is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental
dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished
in the five-year period preceding the application, have been subject to a
recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels
affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to
any other form of rent or price control through the City's valid exercise of
its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income households, unless
the proposed housing development replaces those units, and either of the
following applies:



      1.   The proposed housing development, inclusive of the units
replaced pursuant to this paragraph, contains affordable units at the
percentages set forth in Section 17.38.040 A.



      2.   Each unit in the development, exclusive of a manager's
unit or units, is affordable to, and occupied by, either a lower or very low
income household.



   B.   For the purposes of this Section, "replace" shall mean either
of the following:



      1.   If any dwelling units described in Subsection (A) above
are occupied on the date that the application is submitted to the City, the
proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units
of equivalent size, or type, or both, to be made available at affordable rent
or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the
same or lower income category as those households in occupancy. For
unoccupied dwelling units described in Subsection (a) above in a development
with occupied units, the proposed housing development shall provide units of
equivalent size or type, or both, to be made available at affordable rent or
affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same
or lower income category in the same proportion of affordability as the
occupied units.  All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units
shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If the replacement units will
be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded
affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the proposed development
is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to Subsection (B)(2)
below.



      2.   If all dwelling units described in Subsection (A) above
have been vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the
application, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same
number of units of equivalent size or type, or both, as existed at the
highpoint of those units in the five-year period preceding the application to
be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and
occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as
those persons and families in occupancy at that time, if known. If the
incomes of the persons and families in occupancy at the highpoint is not
known, then one-half of the required units shall be made available at
affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, very low
income persons and families and one-half of the required units shall be made
available for rent at affordable housing costs to, and occupied by,
low-income persons and families. All replacement calculations resulting in
fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If the
replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject
to a recorded affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the
proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject
to Section 17.38.060 B.

   A.   Conditional use permit required. Pursuant to Article II.
(Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards), a conditional
use permit is required for all drive-in and drive-through sales and services.
The conditional use permit process is outlined in Section 17.12.140
(Conditional Use Permit).



   B.   Required Findings. In addition to standard conditional use
permit findings, all of the special findings below shall be made in order for
the designated approving authority to approve a conditional use permit for
drive-in or drive-through sales and service facilities.



      1.   The design and location of the facility and lane will not
contribute to increased congestion on public or private streets adjacent to
the subject property.



      2.   The design and location of the facility and lane will not
impede access to or exit from the parking lot serving the facility nor impair
normal circulation within the parking lot.



      3.   The design and location of the facility will not create a
nuisance for adjoining properties.



   C.   Conditions of Approval. In addition to any other conditions
which may be imposed by the approving authority, any conditional use permit
issued pursuant to this chapter shall include the following condition. If
congestion attributable to the drive-in or drive-through facility is verified
to occur in more than three (3) separate incidents by a city staff person
such that it negatively impacts traffic flow on public streets, such
congestion shall be grounds for revocation or modification of the conditional
use permit, consistent with Section 17.10.120 (revocation of previously
approved entitlement).  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

(11)-foot minimum width on straight sections.



      3.   Aisles shall provide at least one hundred and eighty
(180) feet of stacking space for each facility, as measured from the service
window or unit to the entry point into the drive-up lane. Nonfood and/or
nonbeverage businesses may reduce the stacking space to a minimum of sixty
(60) feet. Exceptions may be granted by the designated approving authority
when an applicant demonstrates that the required stacking space is
unnecessary.



      4.   Aisle entrances and exits shall be at least twenty-five
(25) feet from an intersection of public rights-of-way, measured at the
closest intersecting curbs, and at least twenty-five (25) feet from the
curb-cut on an adjacent property. When an aisle encroaches into the front
yard and side street setbacks, twenty-five (25) feet of landscaping shall be
provided with at least ten (10) feet of landscaping between the aisle and
right-of-way. Exceptions may be granted by the designated approving authority
when aisle pull-out spaces are provided.



      5.   Aisles shall be separated from the site's ingress and
egress routes or access to a parking space.

17.44.050  GENERAL LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   A.   General Location for Landscape Improvements. Landscaping shall
be provided in the following locations for all types of development as listed
below, unless the designated approving authority determines that the required
landscape is not necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. Nothing
in this chapter is intended to discourage landscape areas outside and beyond
the minimum requirements listed herein.



      1.   Setbacks. All setback areas required by this code shall
be landscaped in compliance with this chapter except where a required setback
is occupied by a sidewalk or driveway, or is enclosed and screened from
abutting public rights-of-way.



      2.   Unused areas. All areas of a project site not intended
for a specific use or purpose in conjunction with a current application,
including pad sites being held for future development, shall be landscaped in
compliance with this chapter.



      3.   Parking areas. Within parking lots, landscaping shall be
used for shade and climate control, to enhance project design, and to screen
the visual impact of vehicles and large expanses of pavement consistent with
the requirements of this chapter.



   B.   Landscape Design. Landscaping shall be designed as an integral
part of the overall site plan with the purpose of enhancing building design
and public views and spaces, and providing buffers, transitions, and
screening. At a minimum, the following landscape design requirements shall
apply:



      1.   Planting design shall have focal points at project
entries, plaza areas, and other areas of interest using distinct planting
and/or landscape features.



      2.   As appropriate, building and site design shall include
the use of pots, vases, wall planters, and/or raised planters, as well as
flowering vines, both on walls and on arbors.



      3.   Landscaping shall be designed with pedestrian paths
throughout the landscape areas connecting designated on-site pedestrian
circulation.



      4.   Light-colored, high-albedo materials or vegetation shall
be installed for at least fifty percent (50%) of all sidewalks, patios, and
driveways. Acceptable strategies include white or grey concrete, open pavers,
or any material with a solar reflectance index of at least twenty-nine (29).



      5.   Amenities such as seating areas shall be incorporated.
Entry plazas, bicycle parking, and transit shelters are allowed within
landscape areas.



   C.   Plant Type. Landscape planting shall emphasize drought-tolerant
and native species (especially along natural, open space areas), shall
complement the architectural design of structures on the site, and shall be
suitable for the soil and climatic conditions specific to the site.



      1.   Planting layout and plant diversity. Plant selection
shall vary in type and planting pattern. Informal planting patterns are
preferred over uniform and entirely symmetrical planting patterns. Use of
deciduous flowering trees and shrubs and colorful plantings is encouraged in
conjunction with evergreen species. Groupings of shrubs shall contain
multiple plant types, interspersed with varying heights and blooming seasons
for year-round interest.



      2.   Street and parking lot trees. Street and parking lot
trees shall be selected from the city's adopted master list of street trees
and parking lot trees. A minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the street trees
and parking lot trees, respectively, shall be an evergreen species.



      3.   Trees planted within ten (10) feet of a street, sidewalk,
paved trail, or walkway shall be a deep-rooted species or shall be separated
from hardscapes by a root barrier to prevent physical damage to public
improvements.



      4.   Turf limitations for residential uses. High water use
turf grasses and other similar plantings shall only be utilized in high-use
areas with high visibility or functional needs. When only drought-tolerant
turf grasses are used, the turf area shall be limited to twenty-five percent
(25%) of all irrigated, landscaped areas. The designated approving authority
may grant an exception to this limitation when only drought-tolerant turf
grasses are used. The use of drought-tolerant turf grasses is highly
encouraged. When non-drought-tolerant turf grasses or a combination of
non-drought-tolerant and drought-tolerant turf grasses is used, the turf area
shall be limited to fifteen percent (15%) of all irrigated, landscaped areas.



      5.   Turf limitations for commercial, industrial, and
mixed-uses. The use of drought-tolerant turf grass shall be required for all
proposed turf areas and shall be limited to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of
all irrigated, landscaped areas.



   D.   Planting Size, Spacing, and Planter Widths. In order to achieve
an immediate effect of a landscape installation and to allow sustained growth
of planting materials, minimum plant material sizes, plant spacing, and
minimum planter widths (inside measurements) are as follows:



      1.   Trees. The minimum planting size for trees shall be
fifteen (15) gallon, with twenty-five percent (25%) of all trees on a project
site planted at a minimum twenty-four (24)-inch box size. For commercial,
office, community/civic and industrial development, tree spacing within
perimeter planters along streets and abutting residential property shall be
planted no farther apart on center than the mature diameter of the proposed
species. Minimum planter widths for trees shall be between five (5) and ten
(10) feet, consistent with the city's adopted master list of street trees and
parking lot trees.



      2.   Shrubs. Shrub planting shall be a minimum five (5)-gallon
size, with a fifteen (15)-gallon minimum size required where an immediate

facilities shall be installed so as to maintain and enhance existing
landscaping on the site, including trees, foliage, and shrubs, whether or not
utilized for screening. Additional landscaping shall be planted around the
tower and related equipment to buffer abutting residential zoning districts
or uses, and to buffer public trails. Specifically, landscaping around the
perimeter of the facility (leased area) shall include dense tree and shrub
plantings with the necessary irrigation. Trees shall be fast-growing
evergreen species, a minimum of twenty-four (24)-inch box in size. Shrubs
shall be a minimum fifteen (15)-gallon size covering a minimum planter area
depth of five (5) feet around the facility. Trees and shrubs shall be planted
no farther apart on center than the mature diameter of the proposed species.



   F.   On-Site Pedestrian Pathways. Pedestrian pathway landscaping
shall include shade trees placed so as to cover sixty percent (60%) of the
total pathway area with tree canopies within fifteen (15) years of securing
building permit.

or provided along creeks, such landscaping shall be native plants.



   H.   Public Spaces. Pedestrian space landscaping shall include a
combination of shade trees and pedestrian shading devices (e.g., canopies,
awnings, and umbrellas) placed so as to cover sixty percent (60%) of the
total space with a shade canopy within fifteen (15) years of securing
building permit.



   I.   Signs. Landscaping shall be provided at the base of the
supporting structure of freestanding signs equal to twice the area of one (1)
face of the sign. For example, fifty (50) square feet of sign area requires
one hundred (100) square feet of landscaped area. See Chapter 17.52 (Signs).



   J.   Buffering Between Uses. A landscape buffer shall be provided
between residential and non-residential uses and between single-family uses
and multi-family uses containing three (3) or more units. Buffer areas shall
include a minimum ten (10)-foot-wide planter strip with shrubs and both
deciduous and evergreen trees planted a maximum of thirty (30) feet on center.

maintained one (1) foot-candle of light, measured within a five (5)-foot
radius on each side of the door at ground level.



      5.   To minimize light trespass on abutting residential
property, illumination measured at the nearest residential structure or rear
yard setback line shall not exceed the moon's potential ambient illumination
of one-tenth (1/10) foot-candle.



      6.   Signs. Lighting of signs shall be in compliance with
Chapter 17.52 (Signs) of this code.



      7.   Sports Fields/Outdoor Activity Areas. Where playing
fields or other specialty activity areas are to be illuminated, lighting
fixtures shall be mounted, aimed, and shielded so that the light falls within
the primary playing area and no significant off-site light trespass is
produced. Additionally, the lights shall be turned off within one (1) hour
after the end of the event.



      8.   Wireless Telecommunication Facilities. Wireless
telecommunication facilities and related equipment shall be unlit except as
provided in Chapter 17.76 (Wireless Communication Facilities).



   E.   Maximum Height of Freestanding Outdoor Light Fixtures. The
maximum height of freestanding outdoor light fixtures abutting residential
development shall be 18 feet. Otherwise, the maximum height for freestanding
outdoor light structures shall be 24 feet. Height shall be measured from the
finish grade, inclusive of the pedestal, to the top of the fixture. See
Figure 17.46.050-1 (Shielding and Maximum Height of Freestanding Outdoor
Light Fixtures). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



FIGURE 17.46.050-1
SHIELDING AND MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF FREESTANDING OUTDOOR LIGHT FIXTURES







 



   F.   Energy-Efficient Fixtures Required. Outdoor lighting shall
utilize energy-efficient fixtures and lamps, such as high pressure sodium,
metal halide, low pressure sodium, hard-wired compact fluorescent, or other
lighting technology that is of equal or greater efficiency. All new outdoor
lighting fixtures shall be energy efficient with a rated average bulb life of
not less than ten thousand (10,000) hours.



   G.   Accent Lighting. Architectural features may be illuminated by
uplighting provided that the lamps are low intensity to produce a subtle
lighting effect and no glare or light trespass is produced. Wherever
feasible, solar-powered fixtures shall be used.



   H.   Alternative Designs, Materials, and Installations. The
designated approving authority may grant approval of alternatives to this
section as part of comprehensive design review (Section 17.12.150).  (Ord.

17.48.050  NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.



   A.   The following number of parking spaces shall be required to
serve the uses or buildings listed, as established in Table 17.48.050-1
(Parking Requirements by Land Use). Multiple property owners may apply for a
use permit for shared parking pursuant to Section 17.48.060 (Reductions in
Parking Requirements); otherwise all uses must provide the sum of the
requirements for each individual use. Where the requirements result in a
fractional space, the next larger whole number shall be the number of spaces
required. In addition, the requirements listed below shall apply.



      1.   “Square feet” means “gross square feet” and
refers to the sum gross square feet of the floor area of a building and its
accessory buildings unless otherwise specified.



      2.   For the purpose of calculating residential parking
requirements, dens, studies, or other similar rooms that may be used as
bedrooms shall be considered bedrooms.



      3.   Where the number of seats is listed to determine required
parking, seats shall be construed to be fixed seats. Where fixed seats
provided are either benches or bleachers, such seats shall be construed to be
not more than eighteen (18) linear inches for pews and twenty-four (24)
inches for dining, but in no case shall seating be less than determined as
required by the Building Code.



      4.   When the calculation of the required number of off-street
parking spaces results in a fraction of a space, the total number of spaces
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.



      5.   Where private streets are proposed for residential
development, resident and guest parking shall be provided as determined by
the approving authority in conjunction with the required planning
entitlement(s). (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

shall be guided by the requirements in this section generally and shall
determine the minimum number of spaces required to avoid interference with
public use of streets and alleys.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.48.060  REDUCTIONS IN PARKING REQUIREMENTS.



   The required number of parking spaces may be reduced in accordance with
the following requirements.



   A.   Shared Parking. In order to encourage efficient use of parking
spaces and good design practices, the total parking requirements for
conjunctive uses shall be based on the number of spaces adequate to meet
various needs of the individual uses operating during the peak parking period.



      1.   Use permit for shared parking. A use permit may be
approved for shared parking facilities serving more than one (1) use on a
site or serving more than one (1) property. The use permit may allow for a
reduction of the total number of spaces required by this chapter if the
following findings are made:



         a.   The peak hours of parking demand from all uses do
not coincide so that peak demand will not be greater than the parking
provided;



         b.   The efficiency of parking provided will equal or
exceed the level that can be expected if parking for each use were provided
separately.



      2.   Shared parking agreement. A written agreement between the
landowners and in some cases the city that runs with the land shall be filed,
in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, and include:



         a.   A guarantee that there will be no substantial
alteration in the uses that will create a greater demand for parking without
application for approval of an amended use permit;



         b.   A reciprocal grant of nonexclusive license among
the business operator(s) and the landowner(s) for access to and use of the
shared parking facilities; and



         c.   Evidence that the agreement has been recorded in
the County Recorder's office.



   B.   Other Parking Reductions. Required parking for any use except a
single-family dwelling, second dwelling unit, or two (2)-family dwelling may
be reduced through approval of a use permit by the Planning Commission.



      1.   Criteria for approval. The Planning Commission will only
grant a conditional use permit for reduced parking if it finds that the
project meets all of the conditional use permit criteria in Section 17.12.140
(Conditional Use Permits) and that three (3) or more of the circumstances
listed below are true.



         a.   The use will be adequately served by the proposed
parking due to the nature of the proposed operation; proximity to frequent
transit service; transportation characteristics of persons residing, working,
or visiting the site; or because the applicant has undertaken a travel demand
management program that will reduce parking demand at the site.



         b.   Parking demand generated by the project will not
exceed the capacity of or have a detrimental impact on the supply of
on-street parking in the surrounding area.



         c.   The site plan is consistent with the objectives of
the zoning district and incorporates features such as unobtrusive off-street
parking placed below the ground level of the project with commercial uses
above or enclosed parking on the ground floor.



         d.   The applicant has provided on-site parking for car
share vehicles via a recorded written agreement between the landowner and the
city that runs with the land. Agreement shall provide for proof of a
perpetual agreement with a car share agency to provide at least one (1) car
share vehicle on-site.



      2.   Application submittal requirements. In order to evaluate
a proposed project's compliance with the above criteria, the Zoning
Administrator may require submittal of a parking demand study that
substantiates the basis for granting a reduced number of spaces.  (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.48.070  SPECIAL PARKING STANDARDS FOR OLD TOWN.



   A.   Purpose. Special parking standards are established for the Old
Town area for the following primary purposes:



      1.   Spur growth in the core of old town by not requiring uses
to provide more parking spaces than presently exist in the core;



      2.   Manage the growth of old town by limiting the number of
businesses, offices, lodges, clubs and associations in the core of old town
which may generate traffic or parking demands in excess of commercial, office
and public assembly parking availability, causing the overflow of traffic and
parking to spill over onto adjacent residential streets;



      3.   Manage traffic circulation and parking capacity by
periodically assessing parking capacity in the core of old town;



      4.   Manage traffic circulation and parking by requiring
reciprocal easement agreements between new parking lots and adjacent
properties zoned for public facility, commercial, office or mixed use on
which new parking lots can potentially be developed. The provision of
reciprocal easements is intended to reduce street traffic and the number of
on-street parking spaces used by allowing customers to find a space in an
adjacent parking lot which may not be full.



   B.   Applicability. For the purposes of these zoning regulations,
the Old Town boundaries are defined by the northern side of Park Street, the
eastern side of John Street, the southern side of Plum Street, and the
western side of Oak Ridge Road.



   C.   Special Parking Requirements for Non-Residential Uses.
Generally, non-residential uses in the designated Old Town area are exempt
from the parking requirements outlined in Table 17.48.050-1 (Parking
Requirements by Land Use). However, new non-residential uses and
non-residential uses that propose to expand by fifty percent (50%) or more,
which would result in a parking demand of thirty (30%) or more spaces, may be
subject to parking requirements if required criteria are met through a
subsequent parking capacity assessment outlined herein.



   D.   Parking Capacity Assessment. In order to provide development
opportunity and adequate parking in Old Town, the redevelopment agency has
assembled property for shared parking and reduced standards as outlined
herein to rely on this shared parking rather than compelling each business to
satisfy parking demand on-site. To ensure that adequate parking remains
available, the Planning Commission will periodically evaluate parking
conditions in the Old Town in the form of a parking capacity assessment.
Through analysis of that assessment, the Planning Commission will determine
whether the then current parking supply is adequate to meet the corresponding
parking demand. The following standards and criteria apply to the parking
assessment and determination:



      1.   Assessment Frequency. The city will evaluate and monitor
parking supply and demand on a regular basis. A parking capacity assessment
shall be conducted the sooner of every two (2) years or after every fifth new
use, that would require ten (10) or more parking spaces as outlined in Table
17.48.050-1 (Parking Requirements by Land Use).



      2.   Responsibility and Content. City staff shall prepare the
parking capacity assessment for Planning Commission consideration. The
assessment shall include average and peak parking capacity in the designated
Old Town area.



      3.   Determination of Parking Adequacy. The Planning
Commission shall find that parking is adequate if parking demand does not
exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the available capacity within a two
(2)-block radius of a project.



      4.   Parking Controls. The Planning Commission will implement
parking controls (e.g., time limits, metered parking, and remotely located
employee parking) before seeking to expand parking capacity.



      5.   Shared Parking. The Planning Commission will consider
expanding available shared public parking (e.g., a parking garage) in order
to relieve individual projects of the obligation to provide parking on-site
as determined by a parking management study.



   E.   Reciprocal Easement Agreements. Property owners of new parking
lots are required to provide reciprocal easements to adjacent properties
zoned for public facility, commercial, office or mixed use on which new
parking lots could potentially be developed as determined by the city
engineer or Community Development Director. Placement of reciprocal easements
will be determined by the city engineer and/or Community Development
Director. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.48.080    PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DISABLED.



   A.   Number of Spaces, Design Standards. Parking spaces for the
disabled shall be provided in compliance with the Building Code and state and
federal law.



   B.   Reservation of Spaces Required. The number of disabled
accessible parking spaces required by this chapter shall be reserved by the
property owner/tenant for use by the disabled throughout the life of the
approved land use.



   C.   Upgrading of Markings Required. If amendments to state or
federal law change standards for the marking, striping, and signing of
disabled access parking spaces, disabled accessible spaces shall be upgraded
in the time and manner required by law.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.48.090  COMPACT CAR REQUIREMENTS.



   The following requirements apply to parking provided for all uses or
buildings except one (1) -family and two (2)-family dwellings:



   A.   Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the required number of
parking spaces may be sized for compact cars.



   B.   Compact car parking spaces shall be at least eight (8) feet in
width and sixteen (16) feet in length, and shall be clearly marked,
“COMPACT CARS ONLY,” “COMPACT,” or “C.”



   C.   Compact car spaces shall be distributed throughout the parking
lot.



   D.   Where a section of the parking lot is restricted to compact
parking with an angle of 90 degrees, the aisle width may be reduced from the
standard twenty-three (23) feet to twenty- one (21) feet. Such compact
sections should be located so as to minimize the distance from the section to
the appropriate building or activity.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.48.100  PARKING AND DRIVEWAY DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Surface Parking Area. All surface parking areas shall have the
following improvements:



      1.   Each parking space and aisle, except those accessory to
one (1)-family and two (2) -family dwellings, shall be graded, drained, and
surfaced so as to prevent dust, mud, or standing water, and shall be
identified by pavement markings, wheel stops, entrance and exit signing, and
directional signs, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.



      2.   Lighting, giving a ground-level illumination of one (1)
to five (5) foot-candles, shall be provided in the parking area during the
time it is accessible to the public after daylight. Lighting shall be
shielded to prevent glare on contiguous residential properties.



      3.   Where such parking area abuts a street, it shall be
separated by an ornamental fence, wall, or compact evergreen hedge having a
height of not less than two (2) feet and maintained at a height of not more
than four (4) feet. Such fence, wall, or hedge shall be maintained in good
condition.



      4.   Parking spaces shall be marked and access lanes clearly
defined. Bumpers and wheel stops shall be installed as necessary.



      5.   Landscape materials are permitted to overhang the
curb/wheel stop creating a reduction in impervious surface material.



   B.   Driveway Location Standards. Development projects located at
intersections shall be accessed as follows:



      1.   Driveways to access parcels located at the intersection
of two (2) streets shall be gained through driveways from the lesser street.
Determination of which street is lesser shall be made based on total paving
width, amount of traffic, adjacent traffic controls, and likely destinations
along each street in question.



      2.   Driveways serving parcels located at the intersection of
two (2) streets shall be situated at the maximum practical distance from the
intersection.



      3.   Where a proposed driveway is located at least
seventy-five (75) feet from the nearest cross street, the requirements of
subsection 17.48.090.B.1 and 17.48.090.B.2 may be waived.



   C.   Driveway Size and Composition. All residential driveways shall
be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in length and shall be constructed with a
lasting, durable surface (i.e., concrete, asphalt, grasscrete, or similar
material) and shall be constructed to appropriate requirements as determined
by the city.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.48.110  LOADING AREA REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Required Loading Spaces for Delivery and Distribution. A
building, or part thereof, having a floor area of ten thousand (10,000)
square feet or more that is to be occupied by any use requiring the receipt
or distribution by vehicles or trucks of material or merchandise must provide
at least one (1) off-street loading space, plus one (1) additional such
loading space for each additional forty thousand (40,000) square feet of
floor area. The off-street loading space(s) must be maintained during the
existence of the building or use it is required to serve. Truck-maneuvering
areas must not encroach into required parking areas, travel ways, or street
rights-of-way.



   B.   Required Loading Spaces for Customers. Customer loading spaces
allow bulky merchandise to be loaded into customers' vehicles. Each home
improvement sales and service use shall provide at least two (2) customer
loading spaces per business establishment or one (1) customer loading space
per forty thousand (40,000) square feet of floor area, whichever is greater.
Customer loading spaces shall be located adjacent to the building or to an
outdoor sales area where bulky merchandise is stored and shall be clearly
visible from the main building entry or through directional signage visible
from the main entry. Customer loading spaces shall be not be located in such
a way that they impede on-site traffic circulation, as determined by the
Director of Public Works.



   C.   Requirements for Off-street Loading Spaces.



      1.   Minimum size. Each off-street loading space required by

locations/ways:



      1.   In a locked room.



      2.   In an area that is enclosed by a fence with a locked
gate. The fence must be either eight (8) feet high or be floor to ceiling.



      3.   Within view of an attendant, security guard or employee
work area.



      4.   In an area that is monitored by a security camera.



      5.   Within a dwelling unit, dormitory, or other group housing
unit, live/work unit, or artists' studio. If provided within a unit, racks or
lockers are not required.



   G.   Parking and Maneuvering Areas. Each required bicycle parking
space must be accessible without moving another bicycle. There must be an
aisle at least five (5) feet wide adjacent to all required bicycle parking to
allow room for bicycle maneuvering. Where the bicycle parking is adjacent to
a sidewalk, the maneuvering area may extend into the right-of-way. The area
devoted to bicycle parking must be hard surfaced.



   H.   Visibility. If required bicycle parking is not visible from the
street or main building entrance, a sign must be posted at the main building
entrance indicating the location of the bicycle parking. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.48.130  MAINTENANCE.



   The minimum number of parking spaces required in this chapter shall be
provided and continuously maintained. A parking, loading or bicycle parking
area provided for the purpose of complying with the requirements of this
chapter shall not be eliminated, reduced or converted unless equivalent
facilities approved by the approving authority are provided elsewhere in
compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



CHAPTER 17.50
PROPERTY AND UTILITY IMPROVEMENT



Sections:



   17.50.010   Purpose.



   17.50.020   Curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.



   17.50.030   Underground utilities.



17.50.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish rules and regulations that
govern the installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks and the
undergrounding of all utilities in the city. These requirements, in
conjunction with other applicable requirements of this title, are intended to
establish the applicability of said requirements of development in all new
industrial, commercial, residential subdivisions, and infill projects. This
section addresses the applicability of public utility improvements and is not
intended to supersede the city's construction improvement standards. (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.50.020  CURBS, GUTTERS, AND SIDEWALKS.



   Installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks shall be required for all
new development projects, including new industrial, commercial, residential
subdivisions, and residential or mixed-use infill projects, subject to the
requirements listed below.



   A.   The requirement for sidewalks for an infill project may be
waived by the Planning Commission during the project review process if the
Planning Commission determines, based on discussions with the Public Works
Director and the Zoning Administrator, that continuous sidewalks within the
area in which the infill project is located are not feasible and/or
necessary. Where no other Planning Commission review of the project is
required, sidewalk installation requirements may be waived through a variance
procedure as described under Section 17.12.130 (Variance).



   B.   The requirement for curb and gutter improvements for an infill
project may be waived by the Planning Commission during the project review
process if the Planning Commission determines, based on discussion with the
Public Works Director, that such improvements are not and will not be
necessary within the project vicinity. Where no other Planning Commission
review of the project is required, curb and gutter installation requirements
may be waived through a variance procedure as described under Section
17.12.130 (Variance).



   C.   Some city streets will not require curbs, gutters, and/or
sidewalks. Specific streets where the city will not require such improvements
may be designated through action of the City Council, based on discussion
with the Public Works Director and Zoning Administrator and recommendation of
the Planning Commission.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.50.030  UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.



   The requirements listed below govern the undergrounding of utilities,
including telephone facilities, electrical (69kV or less), fire alarm
conduits, street lighting wiring, cable television and other wiring conduits,
and similar facilities.



   A.   New Developments. In new development areas of the city, all
on-site utilities shall be installed underground, if feasible.



   B.   Existing Developments. In existing areas of the city where
utilities have not been undergrounded, the requirements listed below shall
apply.



      1.   For an existing development that is either being
comprehensively redeveloped or undergoing an addition of building square
footage totaling twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the existing gross
floor area within any five (5)-year period, all utility on the project site
having the capacity to serve the project shall be undergrounded. All existing
overhead utilities that cross or abut the subject property are also required
to be undergrounded. “Comprehensively redeveloped” shall mean any
instance where a demolition permit has or would be issued for a minimum of
fifty percent (50%) of the existing building area.



      2.   For development with less than five hundred (500) feet of
public frontage or where utilities are located within a dedicated public
utility easement, the applicant may elect to pay an in-lieu fee as
established by City Council resolution, provided the project has been
designed to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director and the project is
accessible and can be easily improved at such time as the utilities are
undergrounded.



   C.   Waiver of Undergrounding Requirement. Above-ground meters,
transformers, condensers, switches and other related equipment may be allowed
if approved as part of the site development review process. If the applicant
demonstrates that the city's undergrounding requirement has the effect of
prohibiting the requirement of telecommunications facilities, the approving
authority shall waive the undergrounding requirement. Conditions for approval
of above-ground equipment include, but are not limited to, enclosure in a
building other than the principal building of the development, screening with
the use of walls, partial subsurface locations and other architectural
treatment consistent with the design of the development. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)

17.52.010  PURPOSE.



   This chapter establishes regulations for signs on private property
within the city for the purposes of safeguarding and protecting public
health, welfare, and safety through appropriate prohibitions and
requirements. The city recognizes that signs and other graphics are an
essential element of a community's visual appearance and provide a means to
identify and promote businesses, provide useful information to the public,
and should not become visual distractions along public roadways.
Consequently, the purpose of this chapter is to provide sign regulations for
signs on private property that are consistent with the goals and objectives
of the city's general plan and the community's visual and aesthetic goals. In
addition, these regulations are intended to:



   A.   Promote an economically stable and visually attractive
community;



   B.   Promote signs and graphics that are attractive, pleasing, and
harmonized with the physical character of the environment and surrounding
properties, while serving the identifying needs of the business community;



   C.   Prevent an inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over
noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message
over any other noncommercial message.



   D.   Promote traffic safety and the smooth and efficient flow of
pedestrians and vehicles to their destinations; and



   E.   Direct persons to various activities and enterprises, in order
to provide for maximum public convenience. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.52.020  GENERAL SIGN POLICIES.



   A.   Permits Required. Permits required, application procedures, and
related information is outlined in Sections 17.12.090 (Sign Permit),
17.12.100 (Creative Sign Program), and 17.12.110 (Sign Program).



   B.   Regulatory Interpretations. The requirements of this chapter
shall not be interpreted to nullify any easements, covenants, or other
private agreements that provide for more restrictive sign regulations than
are required by this chapter.



   C.   Enforcement. The Community Development Director is authorized
and directed to enforce the requirements of this chapter. Whenever the
application of this chapter is uncertain due to ambiguity of its
requirements, the issue shall be referred to the Community Development
Director for an interpretation and such interpretation shall be made by the
Community Development Director within ten (10) business days according to the
requirements of Chapter 17.06 (Interpretation). Any decision made by the
Community Development Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission in
accordance with Section 17.10.070 (Appeals).



   D.   Message Neutrality. It is the city's policy and intent to
regulate both commercial and noncommercial signs in a viewpoint-neutral
and/or content-neutral manner. The message of the sign shall not be reviewed
except to the minimum extent necessary to identify the type of sign.



   E.   Message Substitution. Subject to the property owner's consent,
a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted in whole or in part
for the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure or
mounting device is authorized pursuant to this code, without consideration of
message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any
additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this requirement is to
prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial
speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other
noncommercial message. In addition, any on-site commercial message may be
substituted, in whole or in part, for any other on-site commercial message,
provided that the sign structure or mounting device is authorized pursuant to
this code, without consideration of message content. This requirement does
not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot,
or land; does not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting
device be properly permitted; does not allow a change in the physical
structure of a sign or its mounting device; and does not allow for the
substitution of an off-site commercial message in the place of an on-site
commercial or noncommercial message.



   F.   On-Site/Off-Site Distinction. Within this chapter, the
distinction between on-site and off-site signs applies only to commercial
messages.



   G.   General Prohibition. Permanent signs not expressly permitted by
this chapter are prohibited. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.52.030  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW PROCEDURES.



   A.   Permit Required. There are three (3) types of sign permits in
the City of Pinole as listed below:



      1.   Sign Permit. A sign permit is required for all permanent
signs (building attached or freestanding) prior to erection, relocation,
alteration, or replacement of a sign, unless otherwise exempted by this
chapter. The process for application, review, and decision regarding a sign
permit is established in Section 17.12.090 (Sign Permit). A sign permit is
not required for general maintenance of existing signs or the replacement of
the sign face (including message) when the area of the sign is not being
changed and a building permit is not required (e.g., the replacement of a
sign face on a wall sign). A sign permit is also not required for the
establishment of temporary signs; however, such signs shall be consistent
with the development standards and time duration limits established in this
chapter.



      2.   Creative Sign Program.



         a.   A creative sign program provides a mechanism that
is available for the benefit of property owners and businesses, yet is not a
required permit type. It provides a way for property owners and business to
propose and the city to consider special deviations from the regulations for
on-site permanent signs provided in this chapter under certain circumstances.
The intent of this process is to:



            i.   Encourage signs of unique design that exhibit
a high degree of imagination, inventiveness, spirit, and thoughtfulness; and



            ii.   Provide a process for the application of
sign regulations in ways that will allow creatively designed signs that make
a positive visual contribution to the overall image of the city, while
mitigating the impacts of large or unusually designed signs.



         b.   The process for application, review, and decision
of the creative sign program shall be as established in Section 17.12.100
(Creative Sign Program). Upon approval of a creative sign program, a sign
permit is required to erect said signs.



      3.   Sign Program.



         a.   To ensure compliance with the regulations of this
chapter and except as otherwise exempted, a sign program shall be required
for all new sites that:



            i.   Will have permanent signing requirements
which exceed either five (5) signs or two hundred (200) square feet total
aggregate sign area; or



            ii.   The site is a multi-tenant shopping center,
office park, or other multi-tenant or mixed-use development of three (3) or
more separate tenants/uses that share either the same parcel or structure and
use common access and parking facilities.



         b.   The process for application, review, and decision
of the sign program shall be as established in Section 17.12.110 (Sign
Program). In addition, a sign program is optional for all new sites that



            i.   Consist of a lot or parcel, or a series of
lots or parcels combined, which front on two (2) or more publicly dedicated
street rights-of-way;



            ii.   Consist of five (5) or more separate
business activities; or



            iii.   Consist of a lot or parcel, or a series of
lots or parcels combined, to total a minimum of two (2) acres.



   B.   Application Procedures. An application for a sign permit,
creative sign program, or sign program shall be made on the application
materials as provided by the Community Development Director. The application
shall be accompanied by any fees as specified by City Council resolution.
Further, the application contents, processing, and review procedures for each
type of application shall be as specified in Section 17.12.090 (Sign Permit),
Section 17.12.100 (Creative Sign Program), or Section 17.12.110 (Sign
Program).



   C.   Variances. Applications for a variance from the terms of this
title shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission according to the variance
procedures set forth in Section 17.12.130 (Variance).



   D.   Appeals. Decisions of the Community Development Director or
Planning Commission may be appealed as specified in Section 17.10.070
(Appeals).  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.52.040  EXEMPT SIGNS.



   A.   The city has a compelling interest in allowing signs in order
to comply with state and local laws, promote public safety, protect life and
private property, promote the identification of property, guide emergency
response personnel, and permit minor changes to make sign maintenance a less
onerous burden on property owners; therefore, the following sign types are
expressly exempted from the entitlement requirements of this chapter and
Zoning Code but still must satisfy any and all other applicable city permit
requirements when necessary (e.g., building, electrical, plumbing, grading,
encroachment).



   B.   To qualify for any of the exemptions listed below, strict
compliance with the exemption as established in this section is required.

Code/Fire Code or other relevant requirements of the City Municipal Code.
Notwithstanding anything in this section, street address signs may be
illuminated and may contain reflective paint or materials.



         e.   Barber pole, attached or freestanding, when
previously approved by the city as to size, location, and design.



         f.   Change of copy that does not alter the size,
location, or illumination of a sign.



      2.   Exempt Signs with Limitations. The following signs are
exempt from sign permits and city review requirements but must comply with
all other requirements of this chapter (unless specifically noted otherwise)
and the requirements as listed below:



         a.   Flags provided they meet the following requirements:



            i.   No flag may be placed within the clear vision

easily blow away).



   E.   Signs which are mobile, rotate, or move.



   F.   Signs placed on the public right-of-way or affixed to an

Permanent On-Site Sign Area) lists the allowed areas for all sign types. As
identified in Sections 17.12.090 (Sign Permit), 17.12.100 (Creative Sign
Program), and 17.12.110 (Sign Program), a sign permit is required before any
of the sign types listed herein are installed, erected, or otherwise
established. Only those signs that may be permitted are listed. The following
general requirements apply to permanent on-site signs:



   A.   Minimal Illumination. Where illumination of a sign is allowed
under this title, such illumination may be achieved by any method that
minimizes glare onto neighboring or abutting property, such as from behind
the sign (e.g., light source behind the face of the sign, such as with the
opaque, non-transparent face of channel letters; silhouette halo illumination
behind letters) or by a low-level spotlight. In the case of electronic
message signs, this standard is not applicable and, in such instances, the
illumination level shall be such that the intensity of the illumination is
appropriate based upon the level of lighting of the surrounding environment
(e.g., illumination by the sun or moon during day, dusk, night time, and
dawn) through the use of such means as light meters and programmed
illumination regulation or LEDs that are designed to limit the spread of
light.



   B.   Sign Area Allowance. Generally, there is a maximum allowed sign
area for each type of sign. In some instances, there is also a maximum
combined sign area for all signs in that type of development. Where this is
the case, the collective maximum allowed sign area is determined based upon
the overall gross square footage of the individual establishment as described
in Table 17.52.060-2 (Allowed Permanent On-Site Sign Standards).

17.52.070  TEMPORARY ON-SITE SIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   This section describes requirements for temporary promotional on-site
signs. These signs do not require the issuance of a sign permit. Temporary
signs may include, but are not limited to, commercial signs for grand
openings or special product, sale, or event advertising, but exclude any
temporary signs pertaining to subdivisions, which are governed through the
requirements of Section 17.52.080 (Temporary Subdivision Signs). The
development standards for temporary subdivision signs are listed in Table
17.52.080-1 (Temporary Subdivision Signs). The following general requirements
apply to temporary promotional signs:



   A.   Time Duration. Display periods for temporary promotional signs
shall be limited to a maximum of sixty (60) days per calendar year, or as
provided below. Longer time periods may be permitted with issuance of a
temporary use permit (see Section 17.12.070 (Temporary Use Permit).



   B.   Illumination. Temporary signs may not be illuminated.



   C.   Message. Temporary signs displaying a commercial message shall
be limited to on-site signage only. Temporary off-site signage displaying a
commercial message is prohibited.



   D.   Encroachment. Temporary promotional signs shall not encroach on
or above the public right-of-way or be attached to utility poles, except as
provided below for A frame signs. See  Table 17.52.070-1 (Placement of
A-Frames in the right-of-way).



   E.   Temporary Signs Allowed. As established in Section 17.52.050
(Prohibited Signs), pennants, balloons, and other temporary signs are
prohibited; temporary signs displayed outdoors that are composed of paper or
other lightweight material that could not be securely anchored, would easily
degrade, or could not withstand limited exposure to the elements (e.g., a
paper sign whose writing would become illegible if exposed to water, or a
cardboard sign taped to a building exterior that could easily blow away) are
also prohibited. Temporary signs may be constructed of non-rigid material,
provided it is displayed in a window or adequately anchored and able to
withstand exposure to the elements.

17.52.080  TEMPORARY SUBDIVISION SIGNS.



   A.   Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to
all temporary subdivision signs. All permanent subdivision identification
signs shall be as provided for in Section 17.52.060 (Permanent On-Site Sign
Requirements). Temporary subdivision signs shall be allowed in addition to
the real estate signs allowed pursuant to Section 17.52.040 (Exempt Signs).



   B.   Sign Permit Required. Prior to the erection of any temporary
subdivision signs pursuant to this section, approval of a sign permit is
required pursuant to Section 17.12.090 (Sign Permit).



   C.   Deposit and Permission Required. In addition to the conditions
that the designated approving authority may impose through the sign permit,
prior to the erection of any temporary subdivision signs, the sign applicant
shall provide the following:

17.52.090  SIGN CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, AND REMOVAL REQUIREMENTS.



   This section describes the requirements applied to the construction,
maintenance, and removal of signs within the city.



   A.   Construction of Signs. Every sign and all parts, portions, and
materials thereof shall be manufactured, assembled, and erected in compliance
with all applicable state, federal, and city laws and regulations, including
the locally adopted Building Code. All signs shall comply with the following
criteria:



      1.   All transformers, equipment, programmers, and other
related items shall be screened and/or painted to match the building or shall
be concealed within the sign.



      2.   All permanent signs shall be constructed of quality,
low-maintenance materials such as metal, concrete, natural stone, glass, and
acrylics. Techniques shall be incorporated during construction to reduce
fading and damage caused by exposure to sunlight or degradation due to other
elements.



      3.   All freestanding signs that incorporate lighting shall
have underground utility service.



      4.   All temporary signs and banners shall be made of a
material designed to maintain an attractive appearance for as long as the
sign is displayed.



   B.   Maintenance of Signs. Every sign and all parts, portions, and
materials thereof shall be maintained and kept in proper repair. The display
surface of all signs shall be kept clean, neatly painted, and free from rust
and corrosion. Any cracked, broken surfaces, malfunctioning lights, missing
sign copy, or other non-maintained or damaged portions of a sign shall be
repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days following notification by the
city. Noncompliance with such a request will constitute a nuisance condition
and zoning violation and will be enforced as such.



   C.   Interference with Motorist's or Pedestrian's Vision.



      1.   No sign shall be located in a manner which may obstruct
or interfere with the view of a traffic signal or other traffic regulatory
signs. No sign shall, as determined by the Public Works Director, be so
located as to create a hazard to the life or property of any person using the
public right-of-way.



      2.   Any required landscaping may be trimmed as needed to
provide maximum visibility of the sign or signs.



      3.   Signs shall not be located within the clear vision
triangle.



   D.   Clearance from Public Utility Facilities. The person erecting a
sign and the owner of the premises shall maintain any legally required
clearance from communications and electric  facilities. A sign may not be
constructed, erected, installed, maintained, or repaired in any manner that
conflicts with a rule, regulation, or order of the California Public
Utilities Commission pertaining to the construction, operation, and
maintenance of public utilities facilities.



   E.   Determination and Measurement of Sign Area.



      1.   Area Limitations. All permanent on-site signs shall be
counted towards the maximum sign area requirement as established in Section
17.52.060 (Permanent On-Site Sign Requirements), unless exempt pursuant to
Section 17.52.040 (Exempt Signs).



      2.   General area calculation. Generally, the area of a sign
shall be measured as the overall length of the sign multiplied by the overall
height of each segment of copy or logo exclusive of background.



      3.   Void Rule. When the sign is composed of individual
letters applied to the building without a distinctive background (e.g.,
channel letters), the area of the sign shall be measured as seventy-five
percent (75%) of the area of the sign copy (height of the letters multiplied
by the length of each line of letters, e.g., length x height x seventy-five
percent (75%)). This practice of taking seventy-five percent (75%) of the
area shall be known as the void rule. See Figure 17.52.090-1 (Sign Area).



FIGURE 17.52.090-1
SIGN AREA







 



      4.   Awning or canopy signs. Sign copy which is applied to an
awning or canopy shall be computed at one hundred percent (100%) of the area
within a single rectangle enveloping the sign copy. See Figure 17.52.090-2
(Awning or Canopy Sign Area).



FIGURE 17.52.090-2
AWNING OR CANOPY SIGN AREA







 



      5.   Freestanding signs. Freestanding signs are to be computed
as total height by the total length of the sign for one (1) side for
double-faced signs, excluding framework of separate single wood post or
masonry column and single wood or masonry beam. The base of a monument sign
is not part of the sign when made of wood, stucco, or masonry. See Figure
17.52.090-3 (Freestanding Sign Area).



         a.   Freestanding signs that are spread with two (2)
faces (e.g., marquee sign) shall be computed as the greater of the area of
one (1) side or the projected area of two (2) sides.



         b.   Freestanding signs that are spread with three (3)
faces shall be computed as the greater of the area of one (1) side or the
projected area of two (2) sides or three (3) sides.



      c.   Freestanding signs that are four (4)-sided shall be
computed as the greater of the area of two (2) sides or the projected area of
two (2) sides.

FREESTANDING SIGN AREA







 



Freestanding sign area (shaded region only)



      6.   Three (3)-dimensional objects. Where a sign consists of
one (1) or more three (3)-dimensional objects (e.g., balls, cubes, clusters
of objects, sculptures, or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be
measured at its maximum projection upon a vertical plane, as viewed from a
position in the public right-of-way which produces the largest visual
projection. See Figure 17.52.090-4 (Area of Three (3)-Dimensional Objects).



FIGURE 17.52.090-4
AREA OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS







 



   F.   Measurement of Sign Height. Sign height shall be measured from
the uppermost part of the sign used in determining the area of the sign to
the lowest elevation at the base of the sign.



   G.   Setback and Spacing of Freestanding Signs.



      1.   The minimum setback distance for freestanding signs shall
be measured from the back of the public right-of-way or side of a driveway,
unless an encroachment permit is granted. All freestanding signs shall be
located outside of the public right-of-way and any required clear vision
triangle.



      2.   The minimum spacing distance between permanent
freestanding signs, excluding on-site directory signs, shall be fifty (50)
feet. The designated approving authority will review a proposed sign location
on a case-by-case basis to ensure the sign is located outside the required
clear vision triangle and does not otherwise inhibit motorist safety.



   H.   Sign Removal or Replacement. An owner of property on which a
sign was constructed, painted, installed or maintained in conformance with a
permit under this chapter, but for which the permit has lapsed or become
void, shall forthwith remove the sign without additional notice or action
from the city. When a sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and
other structural elements that support the sign shall also be removed.
Affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent portion of
the structure. This requirement does not apply to routine maintenance. 
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.52.100  GENERAL SIGN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   The following criteria shall be utilized for permanent advertising
displays and signs. Signs shall comply with general design standards as
provided here in addition to design standards applicable only to unique sign
types are provided in Section 17.52.110 (Special Sign Requirements).



   A.   Sign type. Signs shall be compatible with the architectural
style of the main building or building upon the site where such sign is
located. The applicant shall consider construction materials, color, letter
style, and other design details in designing an architecturally compatible
sign. Multiple signs on any building, or on buildings within the same
development, shall have the same primary type of building-attached sign.
Signs located on commercial sites but in a predominantly residential area
shall be unobtrusive and designed to be compatible with such residential area.



   B.   Sign illumination. The artificial illumination of signs, either
from an internal or external source, shall be designed so as not to cast
stray light on surrounding rights-of-way and properties. The following
requirements shall apply to all illuminated signs:



      1.   External light sources shall be directed and shielded to
limit direct illumination of an object other than the sign;



      2.   The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an
intensity or brightness that will create glare or other negative impacts on
residential properties in direct line of sight to the sign;



      3.   Unless otherwise permitted by another requirement of this
chapter, signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights, or
other illumination devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness,
or color;



      4.   Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a
manner so as to be confused or constructed as traffic control devices;



      5.   Reflective type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed
fifteen (15) watts shall not be used on the exterior surface of signs so that
the face of the bulb or lamp is exposed to a public right-of-way or adjacent
property; and



      6.   Light sources shall utilize energy-efficient fixtures to
the greatest extent possible and shall comply with Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations (California Building Standards Code).



   C.   Sign copy. The maximum coverage of copy allowed on a sign shall
be eighty percent (80%) of the sign face.



   D.   Sign structure. The sign's supporting structure shall be
simple, yet adequate for supporting the sign face.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.52.110  SPECIAL SIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   In addition to the general design requirements in Section 17.52.100,
the following requirements shall apply to special sign types as listed.



   A.   Wall Signs.



      1.   Wall signs shall be compatible with the predominant
visual architectural elements of the building façade.



      2.   Wall signs shall not project more than twelve (12) inches
from the building façade.



      3.   Wall signs shall utilize a consistent proportion of
signage to building scale, such as 1/3 text to 2/3 wall area or one-forth
(1/4) text to three-fourths (3/4) wall area. See Figure 17.52.110-1 (Text
Scale).



FIGURE 17.52.110-1
TEXT SCALE







 



      4.   Wall sign raceways shall be concealed from public view
(e.g., within the building wall or otherwise integrated with the design of
the sign and building so as to not detract from the architectural character
of the building.



      5.   Channel letters, reverse channel letters, and push pin
letters are preferred in place of can signs. Letters may not utilize
gold-colored (or a shade of gold) trim cap.



      6.   Signage containing multiple elements (e.g., logo and
text) on one (1) façade shall be designed so that the multiple elements are
located and scaled with relationship to each other.



   B.   Awning and Canopy Signs. Awning and canopy signs may be
permitted only as an integral part of the awning or canopy to which they are
attached or applied and shall be considered wall signs for signage area
calculation purposes. The following requirements shall apply:



      1.   Lettering shall be allowed on awning valances only and
shall not exceed eighteen (18) inches in height. Logos, symbols, and graphics
that do not include text may be allowed on the shed (slope) portion of an
awning and shall not exceed four (4) square feet in area for each awning. All
awning signage, text and/or other graphics, whether located on the shed or
valance, shall count towards the total sign area, pursuant with the
measurement rules provided in Subsection 17.52.090.E (Determination and
Measurement of Sign Area). See Figure 17.52.110-2 (Awning and Canopy Sign).



FIGURE 17.52.110-2
AWNING AND CANOPY SIGN







 



      2.   Lettering shall be located within the middle seventy
percent (70%) of the valance area.



      3.   Only permanent signs that are an integral part of the
awning or architectural projection shall be allowed. Temporary signs shall
not be placed on awnings.



      4.   Awning signs shall only be allowed for first and second
story occupancies.



      5.   Awnings shall not be lighted from under the awning
(backlit) so that the awning appears internally illuminated. Lighting
directed downwards that does not illuminate the awning is allowed.



   C.   Projecting Signs. Projecting signs, including, but not limited
to, blade signs, bracket signs, and marquee signs, and shall be considered
wall signs for the purposes of sign area calculations. Projecting signs shall
only be permitted as follows:



      1.   Location. Projecting signs shall be placed only on
ground-floor facades, except for businesses located above the ground level
with direct exterior pedestrian access. In the case of a one (1)-story
building, the top of the sign shall, exclusive of the suspension structure,
be no higher than the roof eave line.



      2.   Angle of Projection. Projecting signs shall either be
located at right angles to the building front along the building façade, or,
when located on the corner of a building, at a forty-five (45) degree angle
to the corner of the building.



      3.   Height. The lowest point of a blade or bracket sign shall
be a minimum of seven and a half (7 1/2) feet above grade.



      4.   Projection. The sign may project a maximum of five and a
half (5 1/2) feet from the building.



      5.   Suspension. The sign shall be suspended with a clear
space of at least six (6) inches between the sign and the building.



      6.   Sign structure. Sign supports and brackets shall be
compatible with the design and scale of the sign.



      7.   Encroachment. Blade, bracket, or marquee signs may not
encroach into the public right-of-way or be located above it, or into
city-owned property except with an encroachment permit.



      8.   Spacing. Projecting signs shall be spaced to maximize the
visibility of signage.



   D.   Freestanding Signs. Freestanding signs, including monument
signs, pole signs, and pylon signs, shall only be permitted as follows:



      1.   Pole Signs. The bottom of the pole sign (excluding the
sign structure) shall be no lower than seven and one-half (7.5) feet above
ground level. The pole sign shall have no exposed connecting, or supporting
wires.



      2.   In an effort to promote full architectural integration of
signs, voids between the sign face and the sign structure are prohibited.
Either the sign face shall utilize the full width of the sign structure or
coverings that are architecturally consistent with the rest of the sign shall
be used to fill any voids.



      3.   Materials and design for freestanding signs shall be
complementary to the materials and design of the buildings for the related
development. For example, if the façade of the building is made of brick or
brick veneer, a complementary freestanding sign would also include brick.



      4.   Landscaping shall be provided at the base of the sign
equal to the area of the sign. Landscaping shall be complementary to and
designed in concert with the landscaping for the overall site. The design of
the landscaping shall be such that natural growth will not obscure the sign
from the public right-of-way.



      5.   The minimum letter height on a freestanding sign shall be
twelve (12) inches. The intent is to limit the clutter of text on the sign
and increase readability for the public, thereby providing for public safety.



      6.   The maximum letter height on a freestanding sign shall be
thirty-six (36) inches. The intent is to limit the visual impact of large
text size. For applicants requesting signage visible to freeway motorists,
the maximum letter height for a freestanding sign shall be forty-eight (48)
inches. For any further deviations from this requirement, the applicant may
apply for a creative sign program or variance.



   E.   Marquee or Changeable Copy Sign. These types of signs shall be
considered to be the same as any other type of sign and shall be regulated
based on their location; i.e., if located on a wall, they shall be deemed
wall signs.



   F.   Electronic Message Signs.



      1.   Off-site electronic message signs. Off-site electronic
message signs shall only be allowed in conjunction with pylon signs along
Interstate 80 pursuant to the requirements provided in Table 17.52.110-1
(Electronic Message Signs).



      2.   Sign area and height. Maximum sign area for all
electronic messages shall be one hundred (100) square feet and maximum height
of sign structure containing electronic message shall be one hundred (100)
feet.



      3.   Sign brightness. The electronic message sign (including
both graphic and video displays) must not exceed a maximum illumination of
six thousand (6,000) nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours
and a maximum illumination of one thousand (1,000) nits (candelas per square
meter) between dusk to dawn as measured from the sign's face at maximum
brightness. All electronic message centers shall be designed and operated
with automatic dimming features and have the capability for the
owner/operator of the sign to reduce the illumination and/or brightness to
adjust to background and ambient light conditions. These controls may include
an auxiliary photocell on or near the sign.



      4.   If an electronic message sign displays more than one (1)
type of electronic message as categorized by Table 17.52.110-1 (Electronic
Message Signs) (e.g., time and temperature message and electronic display),
each type of electronic message shall be subject to the relevant regulations
for such message type when that message type is displayed. For instance, when
a time and temperature message is displayed, it may only be displayed
pursuant to the requirements for time and temperature signs; when an
electronic graphic display message is displayed, it may only be displayed
pursuant to the requirements for electronic graphic displays; even if
multiple message types are displayed on one (1) sign, each message type shall
be governed by the relevant regulations for that message type. Electronic
displays or electronic graphic displays shall not be allowed to use the text
and message limits established for time and temperature messages, even if a
time and temperature message is displayed on the sign in addition to other
electronic message types. The regulations provided below shall apply to the
specified message type whenever such message type is displayed, regardless of
alterations between message types.

17.52.120  NONCONFORMING SIGNS AND ABANDONED SIGNS.



   A.   Nonconforming Signs. Except as otherwise provided by this
section, all existing signs which do not meet the requirements of this
chapter shall be deemed nonconforming signs and shall either be removed or
brought into compliance with the city's Municipal Code when a substantial
alteration to the sign is made. Change of copy shall not be deemed a
substantial alteration. For purposes of this section, a “substantial
alteration” shall be defined as repair or refurbishing of any sign that
alters its physical dimensions or height, or replaces any integral component
of the sign including, but not limited to, alterations to exterior cabinets,
bases, or poles. In addition, substantial alteration shall also include any
repair or refurbishing of a sign that exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
depreciated value of the sign and structure, but excepting customary
maintenance. “Customary maintenance” shall be defined as any activity or
work performed for the purpose of actively maintaining the sign in its
existing approved physical configuration and size dimensions at the specific
location approved by the city and includes the following:



      1.   Repainting the sign text, cabinet, or other component of
the sign without changing the advertising message; or



      2.   Routine replacement of border and trim with substantially
the same colors and materials.



         a.   A nonconforming sign may remain in use provided no
additions or enlargements are made thereto and no structural alterations are
made therein, except as permitted for customary maintenance in subsection
17.52.090.B of this chapter. If said nonconforming sign is destroyed or
removed, or ceases to be used for the use in existence as of the effective
date of the title codified in this chapter, every future sign at the same
location must be in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.



         b.   Abandoned Signs. Abandoned signs may be abated by
the city. For regulatory purposes, any factors indicating abandonment shall
not begin occurring until one hundred and twenty (120) days after this
chapter first goes into effect. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

   A.   The signs must be personally held by a person or personally
attended by one (1) or more persons. “Personally attended” means that a
person is physically present within five (5) feet of the sign at all times.



   B.   The maximum aggregate size of all signs held or personally
attended by a single person is six (6) square feet. For purposes of this
rule, apparel and other aspects of personal appearance do not count toward
the maximum aggregate sign area.



   C.   The maximum size of any one (1) sign which is held or

not be inflatable or air-activated.



   E.   In order to serve the city's interests in traffic flow and
safety, persons displaying signs under this chapter may not stand in any
vehicular traffic lane when a roadway is open for use by vehicles, and
persons displaying signs on public sidewalks must give at least five (5) feet
width clearance for pedestrians to pass by. Persons holding signs may not
obstruct the clear vision triangle, as defined in this title.



   F.   The message substitution policy of the sign ordinance applies
only to traditional public forum areas. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.54.060  STREET BANNER PROGRAM.

CHAPTER 17.56
YARD AND SETBACK REGULATIONS



Sections:



   17.56.010   Purpose.



   17.56.020   Applicability.



   17.56.030   General yard and setback regulations.



   17.56.040   Residential yard and setback regulations.



   17.56.050   Allowed encroachments or projections into required yards.



17.56.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish requirements for yard
areas, setbacks, and encroachments. These requirements, in conjunction with
other applicable requirements of the Zoning Code, are intended to ensure open
areas around primary structures; maintain clear visibility for traffic safety
and pedestrian access, buffer between property and land uses; establish
natural and visual light; establish air space privacy; and provide for
landscaping, and recreation areas.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.56.020  APPLICABILITY.



   The rules for measurement of setbacks, yard areas, and encroachments
contained in this chapter shall apply to all properties in the city and shall
be in addition to any other applicable development standards and measurement
rules contained elsewhere within the Zoning Code. This chapter shall be used
in the application of required setbacks and yard areas as described in, and
shall only be authorized in concert with the requirements of, Article II
(Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards).  (Ord. 2010-02
§ 1 (part), 2010)



17.56.030  GENERAL YARD AND SETBACK REGULATIONS.



   A.   Required Yard Area. Except as otherwise specified in this
title, required yard areas shall be kept free of buildings and structures.



   B.   Exclusivity of Required Yard Area. No yard or other open space
provided around any building for the purpose of complying with this chapter
shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building
or structure.



   C.   Vertical Clearance. Except as otherwise provided in this title,
every part of a required yard shall be open from its lowest point to the sky
unobstructed. Building overhangs, bay windows, and other such elements may
intrude as permitted, pursuant to Section 17.56.050 (Allowed Encroachments or
Projections into Required Yards).



   D.   Lots Abutting Two (2) or More Streets. In the case of a lot
abutting two (2) or more streets, the main buildings and accessory buildings
shall be erected so as not to encroach upon the required yards of any of the
streets.



   E.   Double-Frontage Lots. Where a double-frontage lot has a depth
of one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet or more, such lot may be treated as
two (2) lots, with the rear lie of each approximately equidistant from the
front lot lines, provided all the yard requirements are met.



   F.   Lot Area, Depth, Width, and Setback Reduction. Where a lot area
or a lot width, depth, or setback has been reduced for an existing legally
created lot by not more than fifteen percent (15%) as a result of acquisition
of dedication for a highway, road, drain, or other public purpose, as a
result of dedication pursuant to a condition of approval, the lot area or
yard so reduced may be included in determining compliance with lot area or
yard requirements in the same manner as if the acquisition or dedication has
not taken place.



   G.   Setback Measurement. The setback of all buildings and
structures shall be measured at a right angle from the property line and
determined by the exterior boundaries of the streets and highways and their
proposed widening and extensions as indicated on the circulation plan roadway
system and sizing map of the city's general plan, or if it does not appear in
the circulation plan, in the city's improvement standards. Except as
permitted in Section 17.56.050 (Allowed Encroachments or Projections into
Required Yards), structures shall not extend beyond required setback lines.

   H.   Special Yard Requirements Prevail. Nothing contained in these
general requirements shall be deemed to reduce special yard requirements as
set forth in the regulations in Article II (Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses,
and Development Standards).

17.56.040  RESIDENTIAL YARD AND SETBACK REGULATIONS.



   For yard requirements in Residential Districts, refer to Table
17.24.020-1 Residential Zoning Districts Development Standards in Article II
(Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards).



   A.   Front Yard Variation. In any full block of lots, the front
yards may be varied so that the required yard depth is not reduced more than
five (5) feet, the average of all lots equals the required yard depth, and
the corner lot yards are not reduced.



   B.   Computation of Yards in Residential Zoning Districts.



      1.   In any residential district where fifty percent (50%) or
more of the parcels in any one (1) block, or portion thereof in the same
district, have been improved with buildings, the required front yard shall be
of a depth equal to the average of the front yard of the improved sites, to a
maximum requirement of ten (10) feet.



      2.   In any residential district where adjoining lots are
improved with buildings, the front yard required for a vacant site shall be
the average of the yards within sixty (60) feet of the site on each side
thereof.



      3.   In case a dwelling is to be located so that the front
yard or rear yard thereof faces any side lot line, such dwelling shall be
located not less than ten (10) feet from such lot line. The shorter of the
street frontages of a corner lot shall be considered in the front of the lot.



      4.   Corner Lot. A corner lot shall have a front setback along
each property line adjacent to a street. Where the rear line of a corner lot
lies along the side line of an adjoining interior lot in any residential
district, the yard setback on the street side of the corner lot within twenty
(20) feet of the side line of the interior lot shall be equal to the front
yard required for the interior lot, and a clear five (5)-foot yard shall be
maintained adjacent to the rear line of the corner lot.



   C.   Side Yard Computation. In cases where side yards are to be
computed on the basis of twenty percent (20%) of the width of the lot under
the terms of this chapter, no such side yard shall exceed sixteen (16) feet
in width unless so required by other requirements.



   D.   Computation of Yards for Residential Buildings Permitted with a
Conditional Use Permit. Yards required for residential buildings that are
permitted with a conditional use permit shall be as required for that
particular district or as required for the R-4 Very High Density Zoning
District, whichever yard requirements are greater.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.56.050  ALLOWED ENCROACHMENTS OR PROJECTIONS INTO REQUIRED YARDS.



   A.   In addition to the structures listed in Chapter 17.30
(Accessory Structures) and Chapter 17.42 (Fences, Walls and Screening), the
following structures and architectural features attached to the main building
may project into the required yards as depicted in Table 17.56.050-1
(Encroachment/Projections of Attached Structures into Required Yard Areas).

more than twenty- five percent (25%) of the length of the wall surface on
which the features are located.



   B.   For single-family residential development, a portion of the
main building may project into the required rear yard area, provided that an
equal area of the buildable portion of the lot (this area can be anywhere on
the lot) is provided as a yard or court. See Figure 17.56.050-1

   17.58.050   Severability.



17.58.010  PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult oriented businesses
in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents
of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent
the deleterious location and concentration of adult oriented businesses
within the city. The requirements of this chapter have neither the purpose
nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this
ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to adult oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and
exhibitors of adult entertainment or adult oriented materials to their
intended market. Nothing in these regulations is intended to authorize,
legalize, or permit the establishment, operation, or maintenance of any
business, building, or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute
of the State of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent
exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, obscene or harmful matter or the
exhibition or public display thereof.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.58.020  LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.



   Adult entertainment businesses are permitted subject to compliance with
the location requirements listed below.



   A.   Adult entertainment businesses regulated by this chapter shall
only be permitted as established by Article II. (Zoning Districts, Allowed
Uses, and Development Standards), subject to the regulations outlined in this
Chapter, and subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to
the requirements of Section 17.12.140 (Conditional Use Permit). This
requirement is in addition to other permits of certificates required by law.



   B.   Such use is more than four hundred (400) feet from any area
zoned for residential use.



   C.   Such use is more than one thousand (1,000) feet from any other
adult entertainment business.



   D.   Such use is more than five hundred (500) feet from any public
or private school, day care, park, playground, public building, church,
recreation area, nature trail, synagogue, mosque, temple, or other building
for religious worship, youth-oriented establishments, or any noncommercial
establishment operated by a religious organization.



   E.   For the purposes of this chapter, all distances shall be
measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects, from the nearest point of the building or structure used as an adult
entertainment business is conducted to the nearest property line or nearest
point of any building on the property at issue.



   F.   The establishment of any adult entertainment business shall
include the opening of such a business as a new business, the relocation of
such a business, the conversion of an existing business location to any adult
entertainment use or the addition of any of the adult entertainment
businesses defined in the title to any other existing adult entertainment
businesses.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.58.030  DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.



   Adult entertainment businesses are permitted subject to compliance with
the requirements listed below.



   A.   In any adult theater, the entire interior of the premises where
the pictures are to be viewed shall be visible upon entrance to such
premises; in addition, no viewing booths or areas shall be partially or fully
enclosed or concealed.



   B.   No person shall place, maintain, display, or exhibit any
material in a manner which exposes to public view photographs or
illustrations of specified sexual activities or of poses which emphasize or
direct the viewer's attention to specified anatomical areas. As used herein,
exposes to public view means exposes to the view of persons outside the
building on which said material is placed, maintained, or displayed.



   C.   The building entrance to the adult entertainment business shall
be clearly and legibly posted with a notice indicating that minors are
precluded from entering the premises.



   D.   All building openings, entries, and windows for an adult
entertainment business shall be located, covered or screened in such a manner
as to prevent a view into the interior of an adult entertainment business
from any area open to the general public.



   E.   All off-street parking areas and buildings entries serving the
adult entertainment business shall be illuminated during all hours of
operation. All interior portions of the adult entertainment business, except
those areas devoted to mini-motion or motion pictures, shall be illuminated
during all hours of operation.



   F.   All indoor areas of an adult entertainment business within
which patrons are permitted, except restrooms, shall be open to view by the
management at all times. Individual viewing booths for public use in adult
oriented businesses may be enclosed on three (3) sides only and the open side
shall be one hundred percent (100%) open. The visibility of the inside of the
booths shall not be obstructed. Not more than one (1) person shall occupy any
individual booth at one (1) time.



   G.   Parking shall be provided pursuant to Chapter 17.48 (Parking).



   H.   Nudity at Adult Entertainment Businesses. The United States
Supreme Court decision in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111
(1991), which upheld the rights of cities to prohibit live public exposure of
a person's private parts, specifically applies to adult entertainment
businesses (regardless of whether or not a permit has been issued to said
businesses under this title), including said businesses where no alcoholic
beverages are sold, served, or consumed at the premises. Based on this
ruling, the city prohibits public nudity within the city, including public
nudity at any adult entertainment business. Any adult entertainment business
which is found in violation of this section shall have its business license
suspended pursuant to the requirements of Title V of this Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.58.040  VIOLATIONS.



   Any adult entertainment business that is operating in violation of
these requirements regulating adult entertainment businesses is hereby
declared to constitute a public nuisance and, as such, may be abated or
enjoined from further operation.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.58.050  SEVERABILITY.



   If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or requirement of
this chapter or the application thereof to any person, property or
circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter and the
application of such to other persons, properties or circumstances shall not
be affected thereby.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

17.59.010  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the orderly
regulation of businesses that sell alcohol for on-sale or off-sale
consumption in commercial and mixed-use zones. It is recognized that these
establishments by their very nature, have some objectionable characteristics
and when concentrated, can contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhood. In order to protect and preserve public health,
safety and welfare, special regulations, review of proposed business
operations, and approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning
Commission is necessary.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.59.020  DEFINITIONS.



   As used in this chapter:



   A.   Alcohol. Any bottled or prepared beverage with more than
one-half of one percent (0.005%) alcohol content per volume. This includes
any beer, wine, wine cooler, frozen mixed drink, hard alcohol or spirits,
liqueur or any other variation of a drink with alcoholic content.



   B.   Commercial Zones. The RC and MU zoning districts.



   C.   On-Sale Alcohol. Any drink served and/or prepared at the site
with the intent of buying and drinking at this same site. This includes any
bar or any bar affiliated with a restaurant.



   D.   Off-Sale Alcohol. Any drink served at a site with the intention
of buying the drink there and taking it somewhere private to drink.



   E.   Public Convenience or Necessity. The grouping of criteria that
is considered when making the determination of whether a new site where
alcohol will be bought and sold will be established.



   F.   Residential Zone. The LDR, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4, zoning
districts.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.59.030  REVIEW PROCESS.



   Before the opening of a new business, extending the hours of operation
of any establishment that sells or serves any alcoholic beverage, or adding
to the capacity, floor area or shelf space devoted to alcoholic beverages of
any establishment that sells or serves any alcoholic beverages, the applicant
must obtain a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission. Conditions
of approval will vary with each application including location, on-sale or
off-sale business, public convenience and necessity, and any other, city,
state, and federal laws that may apply. The criteria that will be followed to
approve the conditional use permit are as follows:



   A.   Conditional Use Permit. The Planning Commission shall review
all conditional use permit requests for proposed alcohol sales. The following
information must be provided to approve conditional use permit requests:



      1.   A list of all establishments within a one thousand
(1,000) foot radius with similar size and array of products. If there is any
other establishment, other than a food service establishment with incidental
service of beer and/or wine within a one thousand (1,000) foot radius of the
site of the proposed use that is in the same category of alcoholic beverage
sales or service and the State Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control finds
that the request will result in an overconcentration of alcohol sales within
the applicable Census Tract, then the city shall not approve the application
unless it makes all of the following findings of “public convenience or
necessity;”



      2.   The number of businesses having authority to sell
alcoholic beverages in the census tract of the subject site;



      3.   The extent to which the crime reporting district in which
subject site is located exceeds the average for crime reporting districts
subject to the jurisdiction of the Police Department;



      4.   The proximity of the subject site to school, park,
playground, recreational center, day care, or similar use.



   B.   Public Convenience or Necessity. A determination of Public
Convenience or Necessity (PCN) is required by the Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control (ABC) when there is an overconcentration of alcohol sales
licenses within a defined census tract. ABC determines if there is an
overconcentration of licenses in a census tract and will require a
determination of public convenience or necessity from the city. The City
Council is the appropriate authority to review and make a PCN determination.
This determination must be made prior to Planning Commission review of a
conditional use permit to allow alcohol sales.



   C.   To approve a PCN determination, the following findings must be
satisfied:



      1.   The proposed establishment will promote the city's
economic health, consistent with the General Plan and any applicable Specific
Plan policies to further district purposes;



      2.   The economic benefits associated with the establishment
could not reasonably be achieved without the proposed alcohol sales;



      3.   The applicant has not operated a licensed establishment,
which has been the subject of verified, complaints, or violations regarding
alcohol, public safety or nuisance statutes or regulations;



      4.   The Police Department has reported that the proposed
establishment would not be expected to add to crime in the area;



      5.   Alcoholic beverages sold by the applicant are incidental
to the other products available for sale at the establishment.  (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.59.040  STANDARD CONDITIONS.



   In addition to any other conditions appropriate to the particular
circumstances, the following standard conditions should apply to all alcohol
sales establishments:



   A.   All on-sale or off-sale locations shall comply with the
following conditions:



      1.   Beer, malt beverages, and wine coolers in container of
sixteen (16) ounces or less cannot be sold as single items, but must instead
be sold in manufacturer prepackaged multi unit quantities.



      2.   There shall be no sales of beers, ales or wines that have
screw tops in bottles less than three hundred and seventy-five (375)
milliliters, unless sold in manufacturer prepackaged multi-unit quantities.



      3.   The applicant shall be responsible for maintaining free
of litter that area in front of and adjacent to the premises over which they
have control.



      4.   No signs advertising the sale of alcoholic beverages
shall be displayed outside of the store.



      5.   Licensee or its employees shall regularly police the area

more than two hundred (200) linear feet of display, which shall include the
use of multi-tiered shelving not to exceed thirty-six (36) inches in depth.



      7.   If any of conditions are found to be disregarded, the use
permit for alcohol sales will be subject to revocation. If necessary, the
Planning Commission may modify the use permit after holding a noticed public
hearing and making applicable findings.



      8.   Establish and maintain a “complaint response/community
relations” program with the Police Department.



   B.   On-Sale Business. An on-sale establishment must comply with the

CHAPTER 17.60
CONDOMINIUM NEW PROJECTS AND CONVERSIONS



Sections:



   17.60.010   Purpose.



   17.60.020   Permit requirements.



   17.60.030   Condominium development policy, standards, and criteria.

housing stock.



   17.60.070   Advertising.



   17.60.080   Findings.



17.60.010  PURPOSE.



   A.   Residential condominiums provide for individual ownership of
separate dwelling units which are usually in close proximity to one another.
The area surrounding the dwelling units is a common area that is managed and
maintained by the individual owners of dwelling units in accordance with the
rules of an association agreement.



   B.   This mix of individual and common ownership is different from
single-family residences and conventional apartment house use. In
single-family homes, the dwelling is physically separate and the yard areas
are under the more or less complete control of the owner. In conventional
apartments, there is an implied guarantee of continuous and effective
management of the project, and the occupant is not the owner of the unit and
does not have the burden of financial commitment, maintenance, or resale
associated with ownership.



   C.   The unique nature of condominium projects tends to magnify the
effects associated with higher urban densities to the point where they may
have deleterious effects upon the occupant, seller and buyer who often do not
fully appreciate the implications of condominium living and ownership and
which may lead to conditions of mismanagement, neglect and blight that impact
upon the public health, safety, welfare and economic prosperity of the larger
community. To ensure that such problems are avoided in both the short and
long term, it is the express intent of the city to treat such projects
differently from other multiple-family dwelling developments or other
structures which are not residential condominium projects. It is found that
the special regulations contained in this chapter are required to achieve
this intent, and are applicable to all new condominium developments and the
conversion of existing community apartment projects to residential
condominiums. No part of this chapter is intended to be applicable to
commercial condominiums.



      1.   To establish requirements and procedures to be followed
for the review and approval or disapproval of new condominium project
developments and the conversion of existing multiple-family rental housing to
residential condominiums.



      2.   To establish criteria for new condominium developments
and condominium conversion projects.



      3.   To ensure that the developer of the project provides
adequate private outdoor living space, storage and parking space, open space
and other amenities for residents of condominium project developments.



      4.   To provide for planning and compliance with the city's
general plan, housing element and housing assistance plan.



      5.   To provide a desirable balance of rental and ownership
housing within the city, and a variety of individual choice of tenure, type,
price and location of housing.



      6.   To ensure that the project sponsor is attentive to the
performance characteristics of the structure and mitigates such problems as
vibration and noise transmission, which if not adequately attenuated, may
nevertheless render the living environment within the project insufferable
and the transfer of unit ownership difficult.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part),
2010)



17.60.020  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.



   The developer of a new condominium project or a developer who desires
to convert an existing multiple-family rental housing or a nonresidential
structure to a residential condominium shall first submit an application for
a use permit to the Community Development Department. The application shall
include, but not be limited to, the following, in as many copies as the
Community Development Department determines to be sufficient for its staff
and the Planning Commission to evaluate the project:



   A.   A complete legal description of the property and a boundary map
showing the existing topography of the site and the location of all existing
easements, structures and other improvements, and trees over six (6) inches
in diameter;



   B.   Dimensioned schematic development plans consisting of at least
a site plan, parking plan, typical floor plan, building elevations showing
natural and proposed grades, transverse and longitudinal section showing
natural and proposed grades, and a conceptual landscaping plan for the
project as a whole. (In instances where the project involves the conversion
of an existing structure to condominium usage, the developer shall submit
plans showing existing conditions and proposed improvements, and other
information and plans as determined by the city staff).



   C.   A tabular analysis (submitted on forms provided by the city)
showing how the project compares to the minimum standards for condominium
projects in the district in which it would be located;



   D.   Drawings of typical detailed sections indicating types of wall,
floor and ceiling construction that would be used in both common and interior
partition walls within the condominium project, including either published
data from a recognized and approved testing laboratory of a statement from a
licensed acoustical engineer, or the city building official as to the STC
(Sound Transmission Class) and IIC (Impact Insulation Class) of the proposed
type of construction;



   E.   Such other information which the Planning Commission or
Community Development Department determines is necessary to evaluate the
proposed project;



   F.   No application shall be considered unless all the information
required by divisions A. through E. inclusive, is provided to the Community
Development Department, or the developer files with the Community Development
Department an affidavit or declaration showing good cause for failure to
provide such information. This affidavit or declaration shall set forth in
detail all efforts undertaken to discover such information and all reasons
why the information cannot be obtained;



   G.   Upon formal approval of the use permit, the developer will then
be required to submit a tentative subdivision map for city approval unless
the condominium conversion is exempt from the Subdivision Map Act pursuant to
the California Government Code.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.60.030  CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT POLICY, STANDARDS, AND CRITERIA.



   A.   1.   To achieve the purpose of this chapter, the Planning
Commission requires that all proposals for condominium usage made pursuant to
the requirements of this section, including the conversion of existing
multiple-residential structures to condominiums, conforms to the requirements
of the residential district in which the project is located. Additionally,
the Planning Commission must review the project proposal in order to
determine its degree of compliance with both the condominium development
standards and development criteria delineated in divisions B. and C. of this
section. A condominium proposal which does not comply with all of the precise
development standards in division B. of this section may be approved by the
Planning Commission where the commission finds that there are unusual
circumstances regarding the development's location, site or configuration,
that the project is in substantial compliance with both the development
standards and development criteria, and that there are mitigating features
incorporated in the project which tend to further the expressed intent and
purpose of this chapter.



      2.   Recognizing that the conversion of existing multiple
residential structures to condominium usage presents unique problems with
respect to the requirements of this chapter, the Planning Commission is
empowered to vary any and all requirements contained in this chapter with
regard to a particular conversion proposal upon a specific finding or
findings that the creation of the proposed condominium will not contravene
the intent and purpose of this chapter. Project characteristics of critical
importance in determining whether or not a proposed conversion will
contravene the intent and purpose include the age of the structure and the
degree  to which the proposal varies from the required standards for the
following: Parking, private open space, storage space, sound transmission
characteristics, fire protection and development criteria.



      3.   The Planning Commission is also empowered to impose
conditions on any approval given which would require that specified
modifications, designed to bring a structure into compliance with the
condominium development standards contained in this section, are made to the
structure proposed for conversion.



   B.   Condominium Development Standards. To achieve the purpose of
this section, the Planning Commission shall require, except as noted above,
that all condominium projects conform to the requirements of the residential
district in which the project is located and all of the following condominium
development standards:



      1.   All new condominiums or community apartment projects
shall be developed with at least one (1) bedroom per unit and include
garage/parking and storage.



      2.   Parking Requirements. All condominium developments shall
conform to the following parking requirements: Each unit in the development,
irrespective of size, shall have at least two and two-tenths (2 2/10) parking
spaces consisting of two (2) owned spaces (minimum one (1) garage space), and
two-tenths (2/10) guest space (common). All fractions to be rounded to next
highest number with a minimum of one (1) guest space per development. All
garages to be used primarily for storage of vehicles.



      3.   Requirement of Private Open Space for Each Unit. Each
unit within the project shall have an appurtenant private patio, deck,
balcony, atrium or solarium with a minimum area of one hundred fifty (150)
square feet, except that a one (1) bedroom unit is required to have a minimum
area of one hundred thirty (130) square feet. Such space shall be designed
for the sole enjoyment of the unit owner, shall have at least two (2)
weatherproofed electrical convenience outlets, and shall have a shape and
size that would allow for optional usable space. Such space shall be at the
same level as, and immediately accessible from a room within the unit. The
Planning Commission may allow variations from the above dimensional standards
where it can be shown that the required private open space meets the intent
and purpose of this subsection.



      4.   Storage Space for Each Unit.



         a.   In addition to guest, linen, food pantry and
clothes closets customarily provided, each unit within the project shall meet
minimum FHA storage standards. All exterior storage spaces shall be
weatherproof, lockable and meet fire department requirements. Such space
shall be for the sole use of the unit owner. Walk-in exterior storage shall
have a minimum clear access opening of two and one-half (2 1/2) feet by six
and two-thirds (6 2/3) feet.



         b.   Such space may be provided in any location approved
by the Planning Commission, but shall not be divided into more than two (2)
locations within a reasonable distance of the unit.



         c.   If such space is located within a common area
within the project, the association shall be responsible for the care and
maintenance of the exterior surface of the space in order to assure that that
surface is maintained in a manner compatible with the architectural treatment
of the project.



         d.   Regardless of the location, the precise
architectural treatment of such space shall be approved by the Planning
Commission to ensure that such areas are safe, convenient and unobtrusive to
the functional and aesthetic qualities of the project.



      5.   Sound Transmission Characteristics. Condominiums present
a unique problem in relation to sound transmission. The following methods
shall be utilized to regulate noise transmission:



         a.   Shock Mounting of Mechanical Equipment. All
permanent mechanical equipment such as motors, compressors, pumps and
compactors which is determined by the building official to be a source of
significant structural vibration or structure-borne noise shall be
shock-mounted in inertia blocks or bases and/or vibration isolators in a
manner approved by the building official.



         b.   Noise Resistance. As a minimum, all common walls
and floors between units shall comply with Uniform Building Code Standard No.
35-1. All separating floor-ceiling assemblies between separate units shall
provide impact sound insulation equal to that required to meet an Impact
Insulation Class (IIC) of fifty (50) (forty-five (45) if field-tested) as
defined in Uniform Building Code Standard No. 35-2. Developers of conversions
shall submit to the Community Development Department prior to approval of the
tentative map a written statement of compliance signed by a certified sound
engineer. (The sound transmission requirements stated in this subdivision do
not preclude requirements outlined in the California Environmental Quality
Act, appropriate city ordinances and criteria).



         c.   Plumbing shall be located within walls interior to
the unit whenever possible. Any plumbing in common walls shall be wrapped and
caulked to effectively reduce noise transmission.



         d.   Patios or balconies adjacent to bedroom areas shall
be improved with solid walls constructed of masonry, wood, wood and stucco,
wood on wood, or other acceptable materials at a rate of two (2) pounds per
square foot minimum and to a minimum of five (5) feet in height.



      6.   Fire Prevention.



         a.   Every dwelling unit shall be provided with a smoke
detector conforming to Uniform Building Code Standard No. 43-6. The detector
shall be mounted on the ceiling or wall at a point centrally located in the
corridor or area giving access to rooms used for sleeping purposes. Where
sleeping rooms are on an upper level, the detector shall be placed at the
center of the ceiling directly above the stairway. All detectors shall be
located within twelve inches of the ceiling. Care shall be exercised to
insure that this installation will not interfere with the operating
characteristics of the detector. When actuated, the detector shall provide an
alarm in the dwelling unit.



         b.   Draft stops shall be placed in all attics that are
determined to be accessible by the building official.



         c.   All condominiums shall meet minimum requirements of
fire department.



      7.   Condition of Equipment and Appliances. On conversions,
the developer shall provide a one (1)-year warranty to the buyer of each unit
at the close of escrow on any dishwashers, garbage disposals, washers and
dryers, stoves, refrigerators, hot water tanks and air conditioners that are
provided. At such time as the Homeowners' Association takes over management
of the development, the developer shall provide a one (1)-year warranty to
the association that any pool and pool equipment (filter, pumps, chlorinator)
and any appliances and mechanical equipment to be owned in common by the
association is in operable working condition.



      8.   Condition of Paved Areas. Prior to close of escrow of
conversion units, the developer shall make any repairs necessary to all paved
surfaces to meet current city standards.



   C.   Condominium Development Criteria. The overall quality of the
project, including design, site layout, density, open space and recreational
facilities of the condominium shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission
using the following criteria:



      1.   Land Use Intensity. Land use intensity shall be
consistent with general plan and Zoning Code.



      2.   Overall Design and Site Layout. The following criteria
shall be considered in reviewing the overall design and site layout of the
project:



         a.   The project should have a comprehensive and
integrated design, providing its own open space, off-street parking and
amenities for contemporary living. Insofar as the scale of the project
allows, open space, walkways and other areas for people should be separated
from parking areas, driveways and areas for automobiles.



         b.   Architectural unity and harmony should be achieved
both within the project and between the project and the surrounding community
so that it does not constitute an adverse disruption to the established
fabric of the community.



         c.   The layout of structures and other facilities
should effect a conservation in street, driveway, curb cut, utility and other
public or quasi-public improvements. Additionally, structures should be
designed to minimize, within the context of accepted architectural practice,
the consumption of natural resources either directly or indirectly, i.e.,
gas, water and electricity.



         d.   A landscape and lighting plan shall be submitted to
and approved by the Planning Commission for all outdoor areas, and shall be
submitted with or as part of the project site plan. The plan shall be subject
to approval of the Planning Commission prior to the issuance of any building
permits. Landscaping shall be installed prior to occupancy or, as the case
with conversions, prior to close of escrow of the first unit. Landscaping
shall be maintained in accord with the approved landscape plan.



         e.   Mailboxes shall be located in central locations in
a manner approved by the Planning Commission and the postal service.



         f.   Access to all common areas (open space, facilities,
parking) located on the ground floor areas shall be provided with a
barrier-free design (including curb cuts, ramps, wide gates, etc.) for the
handicapped.



         g.   All common areas shall be maintained by a
homeowner's association.



      3.   Other Facilities. Consideration shall be given by the
Planning Commission to the inclusion of the following facilities in the
project:



         a.   A laundry area shall be provided in each unit, or
if common laundry facilities are provided, then such facilities shall be
subject to the review of the Planning Commission as to their adequacy.



         b.   Requirement shall be placed in the codes, covenants
and restrictions precluding the parking of recreational vehicles and boats on
required owned or guest spaces.



      4.   Utilities.



         a.   All units to be subdivided shall be provided with
separate gas and electric meters and requirement made for individual shut-off
valves.



         b.   All units shall be provided with separate water
meters and shut-off valves. If a master water meter is used, private,
individual meters will nonetheless be required for water service.



         c.   Sewer Lines. Condominium (air space) units: Each
unit shall be provided a separate sewer lateral wherever possible. Where not
possible, each floor shall have its own lateral and the Homeowner's
Association shall be responsible for all maintenance of the common laterals
from the individual unit to the connection with the main sewer line. Planned
unit developments: Each unit shall be provided a separate sewer lateral. No
cross-connections or common connections shall be allowed of any plumbing.



         d.   Individual utility meters, phone panels and address
directories shall be clustered for efficient access for residents and service.



         e.   Group plumbing vents and ducts together wherever
possible in condominium (air space) units to minimize roof penetration. Where
mechanical equipment must be located on the roof, it shall be integrated into
design of the roof and/or recessed or screened from view from adjoining
properties.



   D.   Approval of Tentative/Final Subdivision Map. Approval of the
tentative and final subdivision maps for new condominiums and conversions
shall be pursuant to Section 66427 of the California Government Code and
local subdivision ordinance as amended.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.60.040  DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS AND
PROJECT ELEMENTS.



   A.   To achieve the purpose of this section, the Planning Commission
requires that the declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions and
project elements relating to the management of the common area and facilities
be approved by the Community Development Department prior to the approval of
the final map. In addition to such covenants, conditions and restrictions
that may be required by the Department of Real Estate of the state pursuant
to Title 6 (Condominiums) of the Civil Code, or other state laws or policies,
such declaration shall be subject to recording and shall provide for the
following, none of which, when approved by the Planning Commission or
Community Development Department shall be amended, modified or changed
without first obtaining the written consent of the city and all of which
shall contain a statement to that effect.



   B.   The minimum criteria and conditions which are described in this
section and any other conditions to be placed in the codes, covenants and
restrictions shall be distributed to the developer at the time of the
preliminary conference on the tentative map:



      1.   Conveyance of Private Open Space. The surface area and
appurtenant air space of private open space areas, including but not limited
to the private patio, deck, balcony, solarium or atrium required by
Subsection 17.60.030.A.3 and any integral portion of that space may exceed
the minimum area requirements, shall be described and conveyed in the grant
deed as an integral part of the unit.



      2.   Conveyance of Private Storage Areas. The surface and
appurtenant air space of private storage spaces required by Subsection
17.60.030.A4 shall be described and conveyed in the declaration as an
integral part of the unit.



      3.   Assignment and Use of Required Off-street Parking Spaces.
Required off-street parking spaces shall be permanently and irrevocably
specifically assigned to particular units within the project on the basis of
the parking spaces required per unit pursuant to Section 17.60.030.A2. To the
maximum practicable extent the spaces assigned to each unit shall be
contiguous. In no case shall the private storage area of one (1) unit
overhang or take its access from the required off-street parking space of
another unit. All parking spaces shall be for the use of unit owners. One (1)
bedroom units shall be assigned two (2) parking spaces and may rent
additional spaces from the association as available. An occupant of a unit
with two (2) or more bedrooms may rent one (1) parking space back to the
association. All parking spaces, except those specifically designated for
recreational vehicles, shall be used solely for the purpose of parking motor
vehicles as defined by the vehicle code of the state, and shall not be used
for trailers, unmounted campers, boats or similar recreational vehicles.



      4.   Right of Public Entry to Common Area. The developer shall
file a petition by a majority of the owners, requesting that the requirements
of the California Vehicle Code be enforced on privately owned and maintained
roads as provided in Section 21107.07 of the California Vehicle Code.



      5.   Maintenance of Common Areas and Facilities; General. In
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, requirement shall be
made both for annual assessments of the owners for maintenance and special
assessments for capital improvements. The amount of the regular annual
assessment and the procedure for its change shall be specified. The manner in
which special assessments may be levied for the purpose of defraying, in
whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or
replacement of a capital improvement upon the common area shall be specified.
The remedies which the association may bring for the nonpayment on
assessments shall be specified and may include penalties for late payment.



      6.   Utility Easements over Private Streets and Other Areas.
If the condominium project contains private streets, paths or roadways,
requirement shall be made for public utility easement over the entire private
street, path or roadway network. The Planning Commission may also require
public utility easements adjacent to public streets or over other portions of
the project to accommodate fire hydrants, water meters, street furniture,
storm drainage, sanitary sewers, water and gas mains, electrical lines and
similar public improvements and utilities. The Planning Commission may also
require access routes necessary to assure that firefighting equipment can
reach and operate efficiently in all areas of the project.



      7.   Access for Construction, Maintenance or Repairs. The
association shall have an easement for entry upon any privately owned unit,
where necessary, in connection with construction, maintenance or repair for
the benefit of the common area or the owners of the units in common. Codes,
covenants and restrictions shall include a requirement for prior notice of
entry to occupants when at all possible.



      8.   Termination of Contract. Unless otherwise prohibited by
law, or any local, state or federal regulation, the association has the right
to terminate the contract of any person or organization engaged by the
developer to perform management or maintenance duties three (3) months after
the association assumes control of the project, or at that time renegotiate
any such contracts.



      9.   Preparation of By-laws. A complete set of by-laws for
operation of the Homeowner's Association shall be prepared and submitted to
the city subject to approval as to form to accomplish the purposes contained
in this subsection. Additionally, the by-laws and the codes, covenants and
restrictions shall provide for, and the developer/owner shall establish, a
continuously active guarantee of an amount equal to or greater than the
estimated costs of normal operation of the association for a period of not
less than six (6) months.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.60.050  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.



   In addition to the requirements for a subdivision, the application for
the subdivision of existing multiple-family rental housing as a condominium
conversion is subject to the following additional requirements:



   A.   Code Inspection, Compliance and Disclosure. All units to be
under separate ownership or lease after conversion shall be inspected by the
city prior to city approval of final map. Separate ownership means a
condominium unit where the entire fee is in one (1) entity whether
individually, in joint tenancy, or as tenants-in-common. The cost of such
inspection shall be borne by the applicant. All units shall be brought into
compliance with applicable Uniform Building Codes heretofore adopted by the
city pursuant to ordinance, prior to final map approval by the city.



   B.   Public Report Application. A copy of the proposed application
submitted by the applicant to the Department of Real Estate of the state for
a subdivision public report on the current forms required by the Department
of Real Estate shall be submitted to the Community Development Department
together with the submittal of the tentative map. Such application need not
contain exhibits regarding the availability of utility services or the
organizational documents of the project. However, the application for the
final subdivision map shall include a full and complete copy of all
information submitted to the Department of Real Estate by applicant.



   C.   Notification to Tenants. Developers of apartment conversions
shall, with the use permit application, submit to the city the following:



      1.   A list of names and addresses of the residents of each
unit in the conversion project certified as to accuracy by the developer as
of the date of the application; and



      2.   Certification that the residents of the project have been
notified of the proposed conversion in a manner approved by the Community
Development Department; or



      3.   A separate stamped, preaddressed envelope to the resident
of each unit shall be furnished to the city by the developer at the time the
developer submits an application for a use permit. The city shall use such
envelopes to notify the residents by mailing a copy of the Planning
Commission agenda and notice to tenants no less than seven (7) days prior to
the proposed meeting date on the use permit.



      4.   All new tenants who occupy the property after an
application for a use permit for conversion has been filed with the city
shall be notified of the application by the developer prior to occupancy by
the tenant.



      5.   Please note that additional notice requirements are set
forth in Section 66427.1 of the Government Code for approval of any final map
for the conversion of residential real property into a condominium project, a
community apartment project or a stock cooperative project.



   D.   Pest Infestation and Dry Rot Report. The developer shall, prior
to approval of the final map, submit to the Community Development Department
a copy of a structural pest infestation and dry rot report for all buildings
within the proposed project. This report shall be made available to all
prospective buyers by the developer.



   E.   Building Security. The developer shall comply with all
conditions of the city's Police Department in respect to building security.
In addition, prior to the approval of the final map, all locks in the project
shall be changed so that no master key or other keys previously used will
allow entry into any unit of the project after conversion. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.60.060  EFFECT OF PROPOSED APARTMENT CONVERSION ON THE CITY'S HOUSING
STOCK.



   In reviewing requests for conversion of existing apartment buildings to
condominiums, the city shall consider the following:



   A.   Whether or not the amount and impact of the displacement of
tenants if the conversion were approved would be detrimental to the health,
safety or general welfare of the community;



   B.   The role that the apartment structure plays in the existing
housing rental market. Particular emphasis will be placed on the evaluation
of rental structures to determine if the existing apartment complex is
serving low income and moderate income households. Standard definitions of
low income and moderate income rents used by the federal and state
governments will be used in the evaluation. Along with other factors, the
city will consider the following:



   C.   The number of families on current waiting lists for assisted
rental housing programs that operate in Pinole, such as Housing Act Section
23 and Section 236 programs;



   D.   The probable income range of tenants living in existing
apartments based on the assumption that households pay between one-quarter
(1/4) and one-third (1/3) of their income for housing. That income range will
be compared with existing income limits for the Section 8 program to
determine whether potential displaced tenants can be categorized as low
income and moderate income;



   E.   The need and demand for lower cost homeownership opportunities
which are increased by the conversion of apartments to condominiums;



   F.   Conversion projects shall not be approved by the Planning
Commission if, on the basis of a representative sampling of the number of
rental dwelling units relative to the total available dwelling units in the
city (supplied by developer and verified by city) is less than fifteen
percent (15%);



   G.   If the Planning Commission or City Council determines that
vacancies in the project have been increased for the purpose of preparing the
project for conversion, the tentative map and use permit application may be
disapproved. In evaluation of the current vacancy level under this
subsection, the increase in rental rates for each unit over the preceding
five (5) years and the average monthly vacancy rate for the project over the
preceding two (2) years shall be considered;



   H.   The applicant shall provide relocation information consisting
of data indicating the current and continually available, competitively
priced, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units within the immediate area
(Pinole, Hercules, Rodeo, and El Sobrante). The number of available dwelling
units shall be sufficient to assure accommodation of such displaced tenants.
This requirement is not applicable if the city determines, on the basis of a
representative sampling of apartment buildings conducted by the city, that
the city-wide apartment vacancy rate exceeds five percent (5%). Any such
representative sampling used shall not be more than ninety (90) days old. In
addition, the developer shall pay each household displaced by the project an
amount determined by the Planning Commission as being representative of
commercial relocation costs within the market area. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.60.070  ADVERTISING.



   The developer shall make no advertising use of any city approval of
use, subdivision or occupancy for the project.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part),
2010)



17.60.080  FINDINGS.



   Approval of the final map for a condominium or the conversion of
residential real property into a condominium project is subject to findings
as required by Section 66427.1 of the Government Code, as amended. The
findings shall not diminish, limit or expand, other than as provided in this
chapter, the authority of the city to approve or disapprove any condominium
projects.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

17.63.020  PERMIT REQUIRED.



   A.   It shall be unlawful under this chapter for any person to
engage in the business of selling, transferring, or leasing, or advertising
for sale, transfer or lease, or offer or expose for sale, transfer or lease,
any firearm unless he or she has been issued a license as required by this
chapter. "Engage in the business" means the conduct of a business by the

(part), 2010)



17.64.020  APPLICABILITY.

all home occupations as defined by Chapter 17.98 (Glossary of Terms) in the
city and shall be in addition to any other development standards and
regulations contained elsewhere within the Zoning Code (e.g., lighting).
Pursuant to the requirements of Article II (Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses,
and Development Standards), home occupations are permitted in all residential
zoning districts, subject to compliance with the standards of this chapter

advertising signs for the outdoor activity may be permitted above the maximum
allowable sign area for the corresponding primary use as established in
Chapter 17.52 (Signs), except when the outdoor activity is the primary use
(e.g., Christmas tree lot).



      5.   Maintenance. Outdoor activity areas shall be kept free of
garbage and other debris, and shall not encroach into required sidewalk
clearance areas as follows: all outdoor activity areas shall leave a minimum
horizontal clear space of six (6) feet, or such greater amount of clear space

development standards shall apply to all permanent and temporary outdoor
display and sales activities.



      1.   Associated with the primary use. All outdoor display and
sales activities shall be associated with the primary use of the property.
Only those goods and services associated with the primary use may be stored,
sold, or displayed. All outdoor display and sales activities that are
independent of the primary use shall be considered their own primary use and
regulated as such (e.g., seasonal sales as a temporary use requiring a
temporary use permit).



      2.   Maximum area. Unless otherwise authorized by a use
permit, the area used for permanent outdoor display and sales of materials
shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross floor area of the
corresponding commercial building. Vehicle and equipment sales and rentals
(e.g., automobile, boat, RV, construction equipment)are exempt from this
requirement, provided storage and display is limited to vehicles offered for
sale or rental only and all other development requirements are satisfied.



      3.   Time limit for temporary activities. See the requirements
of Chapter 17.74 (Temporary Uses) for duration and permit requirements for
temporary promotional sales.



      4.   Height Limit. Displayed outdoor sales, other than plant
materials for sale (e.g., Christmas trees, nursery trees, etc.) shall not
exceed a height of six (6) feet above finished grade, unless a greater height
is allowed through use permit approval.



   C.   Standards for Outdoor Storage. The following development
standards shall apply to all permanent and temporary outdoor storage
activities.



      1.   Location. Outdoor storage may not be located within any
required front or street side yard for the applicable zoning district within
which the activity is located.



      2.   Height limitation. The height of stacked materials and
goods shall be no greater than that of any building, wall, fence, or gate
enclosing the storage area, unless specifically stated as a development
standard associated with a use.



      3.   Screening. Screening of outdoor storage shall be
consistent with Section 17.42.050 (Special Fence, Wall and Screening
Requirements).



      4.   Parking. Parking for permanent outdoor storage shall be
provided as required in Chapter 17.48 (Parking).



   D.   Requirements for Outdoor Seating. The following development
standards shall apply to all permanent outdoor seating.



      1.   Permittee to ensure maintenance. The permittee shall be
responsible for, and exercise reasonable care in, the inspection,
maintenance, and cleanliness of the area affected by the outdoor seating,
including any design requirements hereafter enacted, from the building
frontage to the curb.



      2.   Permittee to ensure compliance. The permittee shall
restrict the outdoor seating to the approved location and ensure compliance
with all applicable laws including laws against blocking the public
right-of-way, health and safety laws, public cleanliness laws, and laws
regulating sale and public consumption of alcohol.



      3.   If conflict exists or is created between city and outdoor
seating. When any outdoor seating authorized hereunder is found to be in
conflict with existing or proposed facilities or improvements owned,
maintained, or operated by the city, or any existing or proposed city design
plans, such placement shall, upon written demand of the City Manager, be
removed or relocated in such a way as to eliminate the conflict, and said
removal or relocation shall be at the sole expense of the permittee. Should
the permittee fail to comply with said written demand within a reasonable
period of time, the city may cause such relocation of the placement at the
expense of the permittee. Any such non-compliance shall also be a violation
of this title.



      4.   Parking. When the Community Development Director finds
that the proposed additional seating would lead to new parking demand that
exceeds available supply because of the amount of outdoor seating, he or she
may require off-street parking for the outdoor area devoted for the outdoor
seating at the rate required for interior floor area for food service
establishments in the zoning district. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

   Consistent with state policy to promote the use of solar energy systems
and to limit obstacles to their use, the purpose of this chapter is to
encourage the development and use of active and passive solar energy
strategies, including the use of sunlight for heating water and air in homes
and for providing a renewable source of energy for all properties.  (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.72.020  APPLICABILITY.



   The requirements contained in this chapter are guidelines that apply to
all solar energy systems in addition to any other development requirements
contained elsewhere within the Zoning Code (e.g., building height). Solar
energy systems are permitted by right in all zoning districts subject to
approval of a building permit, plumbing permit, and/or electrical permit
issued by the Building Official.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.72.030  DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES.



   The guidelines below assist property owners and residents in the
optimum development of solar energy systems. Refer to state law for mandatory
state requirements.



   A.   Building-Mounted Solar Energy Systems - Construction Guidelines.



      1.   Consider designing at least one (1) section of roof with
at least three hundred (300) square feet of uninterrupted space for the
installation of solar energy systems. This space should be free of any
skylights, equipment, parapets, or other structural obtrusion. This area of
roof should be south-facing and free of shading.



      2.   Consider using an architectural style with flat roofs
that would be conducive to the use of solar energy systems. Styles such as
Italianate and some neo-classical architectural styles commonly include flat
roofs. Parapet roofs can also be easily designed to support solar facilities.



   B.   Building Mounted Solar Energy Systems;  Building Orientation.
Buildings should be located to maximize energy efficiency through the
creation of optimal conditions for the use of both passive and active solar
strategies. Such strategies include, but are not limited to, the following:



      1.   Buildings should be oriented such that one (1) axis of
each building is at least one and one half (1.5) times longer than the other
and such that the longer axis is within fifteen (15) degrees of the
geographical east/west axis. Projects or sites with more than one (1)
building should be oriented such that at least seventy-five percent (75%) or
more of all buildings satisfy these standards.



      2.   Projects or sites with more than one (1) building should
be designed such that for seventy-five percent (75%)  or more of the
project's blocks, one (1) axis of each block is within fifteen (15) degrees
of geographical east/west and the east/west length of each block is at least
as long as, or longer than, the north/south length of the block.



      3.   The south-facing walls of buildings should not be more
than twenty-five percent (25%) shaded, as measured at noon on December 21.



   C.   Shading. Buildings, landscaping, vegetation, fences, and other
solar screens should be located and sited to the minimum extent possible so
that they do not preclude or discourage the use of solar energy on-site and
for adjacent properties and buildings. Consideration should be given to the
mature height of trees and other landscaping. Where necessary, the Community
Development Director may require submission of a map showing shadows cast by
solar screens, including landscaping and vegetation at maturity, for 12:00
p.m. noon on December 21. Vegetation shading solar energy systems shall be
removed in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 25980 et seq., which
governs solar shading.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

17.74.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations for uses of
private property that are temporary in nature. These requirements place
restrictions on location and duration, and create standards to minimize
potential impacts of the temporary use on surrounding property and ensure the
general health, safety, and welfare of persons residing within the
community.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.74.020  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS.



   A.   Temporary Use Permit Required. Except as otherwise provided in
the Zoning Code, the temporary uses listed in this chapter shall require the
issuance of a temporary use permit from the designated approving authority
prior to establishment of the use. The process for accepting, reviewing, and
approving or denying a temporary use permit shall be as described in Section
17.12.070 (Temporary Use Permit). Additionally, the designated approving
authority may impose conditions on the approval of a temporary use consistent
with the standards of Section 17.12.070 (Temporary Use Permit). This permit
shall be subject to internal review by any/all departments necessary, as
determined by the Community Development Director.



   B.   Option for Conditional Use Permit. Applicants seeking a
temporary use permit for a time period longer than otherwise allowed by this
chapter may submit for a conditional use permit for said activity, provided
that it complies with all other relevant development and operational
standards (other than time duration) for the use as provided in this chapter.
Approval of the conditional use permit shall be in accordance with the
standards of Section 17.12.140 (Conditional Use Permits).

the buildable portion of the lot. For new business with a valid business
license, such outdoor sales and displays of goods shall be limited to a
maximum thirty (30)-day period within the first one hundred and eighty (180)
days after that business is established. Existing businesses shall be limited
to a maximum of three (3) periods totaling a maximum of thirty (30) days
within a given year. Sales and displays may not occupy more than ten percent
(10%) of the parking area for that business and shall not substantially alter
the existing circulation pattern of the site. Temporary sales and displays
shall not obstruct any existing disabled accessible parking space.



   F.   Seasonal sales (e.g., Christmas tree sales, pumpkin sales) may
be permitted in any non-residential zoning district upon issuance of a
temporary use permit. The term of the temporary use permit shall not exceed
sixty (60) days per seasonal sales location per calendar year. The seasonal
merchandise shall not utilize required parking spaces dedicated to other uses.



   G.   Temporary sales and construction offices used for the sale of

17.76.010  PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish development
standards for regulating the placement and design of commercial wireless
telecommunication facilities in order to preserve and to protect the visual
character of Pinole from any adverse environmental effects of wireless
telecommunication facilities; to ensure against the creation of visual blight
on the city's major or minor ridgelines, protected areas, and view corridors
as identified on the Visual resources map (Figure 10.4) of the general plan;
to protect the environmental resources of the city; and to protect the
citizens of Pinole from any possible adverse health effects associated with
exposure to high levels of NIER (non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation) to
the extent permitted by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The city
acknowledges the community benefit associated with the requirement of
commercial wireless telecommunication services within the city and encourages
the lease of publicly owned properties for the development of commercial
wireless telecommunication facilities to the extent compatible with existing
facilities. The regulations as set forth are consistent with federal and
state law related to the development of commercial wireless telecommunication
transmission facilities.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.76.020  APPLICABILITY.



   The regulations and standards contained in this chapter shall apply to
all wireless telecommunication facilities on private and public property in
the city, including public streets and alleys and property owned by any
local, state, or federal government agency or political subdivision of such
government entity, and shall be in addition to any other development
standards and regulations contained elsewhere within the Zoning Code (e.g.,
lighting). Wireless telecommunication facilities are permitted as listed in
Article II. (Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards),
subject to compliance with the standards of this chapter and other relevant
requirements of this title. Permitted wireless telecommunication facilities
are also identified for each zoning district in Table 17.20.030-1 (Allowed
Uses and Permit Requirements for City of Pinole Base Zoning Districts). 
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.76.030  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Conditional Use Permit Requirements and Exceptions. Except as
otherwise outlined below, a conditional use permit as established by Section
17.12.140 (Conditional Use Permit) is required for all wireless communication
facilities. Also see Section 17.76.040 (Exemptions) for specific exemptions.



      1.   In order to ensure compliance with the requirements of 47
U.S.C. section 332(c)(7)(B), an applicant that believes that the city's
prohibition of wireless telecommunications facilities in particular zoning
districts or any of the standards in this chapter either



         a.   Unreasonably discriminate among providers or
functionally equivalent services; or



         b.   Prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
requirement of personal wireless services, may apply for a conditional use
permit. In order for such permit to be granted, the decision maker must find,
in addition to all other required findings for the granting of a conditional
use permit, that substantial evidence in the written record establishes that
either of the above stated criteria is met.



      2.   Collocation. Administrative review and approval may be
available, so long as a collocation facility satisfies all requirements set
forth in Section 65850.6 of the California Government Code.



   B.   Public Hearing and Public Notice. A public hearing shall be
held and public noticing conducted as established in Section 17.10.050
(Public Hearing and Public Notice), except that public notice shall be given
to all property owners within five hundred (500) feet of the property of the
proposed wireless telecommunication facility, instead of only providing
notice to property owners within three hundred (300) feet, as normally
required by Section 17.10.050 (Public Hearing and Public Notice).



   C.   Financial Guarantee. Prior to constructing a new wireless
telecommunication facility, or prior to renewing a conditional use permit for
an existing wireless telecommunication facility, the applicant or permittee
shall provide a financial guarantee that shall be indexed annually for
inflation in an amount, satisfactory to the designated approving authority,
for the removal of the facility, based on the estimated cost to remove the
facility in the event the use is abandoned or the conditional use permit
expires, or is revoked, or otherwise terminated. The amount of the guarantee
per freestanding tower may be reduced or eliminated if the applicant has more
than one (1) wireless telecommunication facility in the city. If the owner or
lessee does not remove any obsolete or unused facilities, as described above,
the financial guarantee shall be used by the city to remove any obsolete or
unused facilities and to return the site to its predevelopment conditions.
Any unused financial guarantee shall be returned to the applicant upon
removal of the wireless telecommunication facility or transfer of the lease
accompanied by a financial guarantee from the new lessee or owner.



   D.   Conditions of Approval. The designated approving authority may
impose conditions of approval as described in Section 17.12.140 (Conditional
Use Permit), including but not limited to, requiring modifications to the
site.



   E.   Requirements and Allowances Upon Approval.



      1.   Written proof of the availability of the necessary water
supply to sustain any landscaping required for visual screening prior to
permit issuance. This may be in the form of a letter from the landowner of
the land allowing the applicant the use of required water facilities for
landscaping installed improvements in the area.



      2.   Minor modifications to the approved equipment design,
location, elevations, and other elements of the approved wireless
telecommunication facilities may be allowed by the Community Development
Director if such modifications are in keeping with the architectural
statement and layout design of the original approval.



   F.   Ongoing Public Hearings Required. All permit approvals for
commercial wireless telecommunication facilities are subject to a public
hearing every five (5) years to demonstrate continuing compliance with the
conditions of approval. When reviewing existing facilities for renewal, the
designated approving authority of the original entitlement shall determine
whether substantial progress has been made in decreasing the visibility of
these facilities. At the time of each five (5)-year review, modifications and
new and/or revised conditions of approval may be made to the original
conditional use permit if technology has advanced to the point where the
wireless telecommunication facilities can be made safer or less visually
obtrusive or to conform to other similar wireless telecommunication
facilities that are currently being installed or are located in California at
the time of entitlement review. These reviews shall include photo
documentation of existing conditions and equipment for comparison with past
conditions, to facilitate policy goals related to minimizing site disturbance
and visibility, and justify the need for the range of equipment. Additional
equipment shall only be allowed where the cumulative visual impacts are
decreased through replacement with smaller equipment or additional mitigation
to decrease visibility.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

      3.   Tower safety. All antennas shall be located within in an
enclosed fenced area or have a minimum five (5)-foot-high tower shield at the
tower base to prevent climbing. All active elements of antennas shall have a
minimum vertical clearance of eight (8) feet.



   E.   Satellite antennas used or designed for receiving or
transmitting electronic signals to or from orbiting earth satellites that
comply with the following standards. Exceptions to these requirements may be
granted by the designated approving authority upon the issuance of a
conditional use permit as provided by Section 17.12.140 (Conditional Use
Permit).



      1.   Dimensions of the satellite antenna shall be no greater
than 18 inches in dimensions.



      2.   Satellite antennas greater than eighteen (18) inches
dimension in compliance with the following.



         a.   A setback equal to the height of the antenna or the
setback that applies to the principal structure, whichever is greater, shall
be maintained between any property lines and any part of the antenna. In
addition, installation shall be prohibited between any street and principal
building on the site, except as provided below.



         b.   In any case where a lot backs up to a public
right-of-way or private street, a setback of fifteen (15) feet shall be
maintained between the rear property line and any portion of the antenna.



         c.   Maximum height of the antenna shall be fifteen (15)

energy conversion systems shall include the following information:



      1.   Name and address of the applicant;



      2.   Evidence that the applicant is the owner of the premises
involved or that the applicant has written permission of the owner to make
such an application;



      3.   A plot plan and development plan drawn in sufficient
detail to clearly describe:



         a.   A property line and physical dimensions of the
proposed site;



         b.   Location, approximate dimensions and types of major
existing structures and uses of the site;



         c.   Location and elevation of the proposed WECS;



         d.   Location of all aboveground utility lines and other
WECS on-site or within one (1) radius of the total height of the proposed
WECS;



         e.   Location and size of structures or trees above
thirty-five (35) feet within a five-hundred-(500) foot radius of the proposed
WECS. For purposes of this requirement, electrical transmission and
distribution lines, antennae and slender or open-lattice towers are not
considered structures;



         f.   Location of all transmission facilities proposed
for installation, and



         g.   Location of all road and other service structures
proposed as part of the installation including any easements for servicing
and dismantling.



   C.   Compliance with Uniform Building Code required for all WECS.



      1.   Building permit applications shall be accompanied by
drawings of the structural components of the wind energy conversion system
including support structures, tower, base and footings. Drawings and any
necessary calculations shall be certified in writing by a California
registered professional engineer that the system complies with the Uniform
Building Code;



      2.   Where the structural components or installation vary from
the standard design or specification, the proposed modifications shall be
certified by a California registered professional engineer for compliance
with the seismic and structural design requirements of the Uniform Building
Code.



   D.   Compliance with National Electrical Code required for all WECS.



      1.   Building permit applications shall be accompanied by a
line drawing identifying the electrical components of the wind system to be
installed in sufficient detail to allow for a determination that the manner
of installation conforms to the National Electrical Code. The application
shall include a statement from a California registered professional engineer
indicating that the electrical system conforms with standard engineering
practices and complies with the National Electrical Code;



      2.   Where the electrical components of an installation vary
from the standard design or specifications, the proposed modifications shall
be reviewed and certified by a California registered professional engineer
for compliance with the requirements of the National Electrical Code and
standard engineering practices.



   E.   Rotor Safety. Each wind energy conversion system must be
equipped with both manual and automatic control to limit the rotational speed
of the blade below the design limits of the rotor. The application must
include a statement by a California registered professional engineer
certifying that the rotor and overspeed controls have been designed and
fabricated for the proposed use in accordance with standard engineering
practices. The engineer should also certify the structural compatibility of
the proposed tower with proposed rotor.



   F.   Performance Standards.



      1.   Wind energy conversion systems shall be designed to
prevent the intrusion of exterior noise levels beyond the following
prescribed levels. Proper design shall include but not be limited to,
setbacks, shielding, automatic shut-off, and sound insulation. Exterior noise
levels attributable to any WECS shall not exceed a daily community noise
equivalent level (CNEL) of fifty (50) db as measured at/or beyond adjacent
property lines within residential zoning districts or a CNEL of sixty (60) db
within all other zoning districts. The applicant shall include an acoustical
report prepared by a practicing acoustical engineer (registered with the
state office of noise control) or other qualified professional, certifying
that the proposed WECS, including all mechanical hardware, will not exceed
the prescribed CNEL during its full range of operation. Any noise abatement
plan included in the acoustical report shall also indicate the expected final
CNEL after required mitigation measures have been implemented.



      2.   A WECS shall not be installed in any location along the
major axis of an existing microwave communications link where the operation
of the WECS is likely to produce an unacceptable level of electromagnetic
interference unless the applicant provides sufficient evidence indicating
that the degree of interference will not disrupt the communications link. The
WECS shall be located in accordance with guidelines of the Federal Aviation
Administration.



   G.   Signs. At least one (1) sign shall be posted at the base of the
tower warning of electrical shock or high voltage and that rotor may start
without notice.



   H.   Height. The maximum allowable hub height is one hundred (100)
feet from the ground and in no case shall the lowest reach of the rotor be
less than twenty (20) feet from the ground. Tower climbing apparatus shall be
no lower than twelve (12) feet from the ground and shall be equipped with an
anti-climbing device approved by the public services department.



   I.   Wind Access. The proposed site of a WECS shall have sufficient
access to unimpeded air flow for adequate operation of the WECS in accordance
with the manufacturer's recommendations. The WECS shall be set back a minimum
of two (2) rotor diameters from all property lines unless it can be
demonstrated that a lesser setback can protect the wind access of the
downwind properties. Calculations for these setbacks may include streets,
flood control channels and transmission line and railroad rights-of-way.
Contiguous property owners and planned developments may construct a WECS for
their use in common. If property held by more than one (1) single owner is
used to meet the setback requirement, there shall be an easement recorded on
the affected properties after prior review and approval by the City Attorney.



   J.   Design Considerations. All electric lines serving the WECS
shall be installed underground. No towers with guy wire supports and no
lattice-type towers are allowed on lots less than one (1) acre. Guyed towers
shall be located within a six (6)-foot fence of sufficient radius to enclose
all guy cables.



   K.   Utility Notification (For Those WECS which will be
Interconnected to a Utility Grid). No wind turbine shall be installed until
written notice has been given to the utility company and a copy filed with
the city public services department.



   L.   Maintenance. The tower and generating unit shall be kept in
good repair. The WECS shall be deemed abandoned if not in continuous use
except for maintenance and repairs for a period exceeding six (6) months and
shall be removed.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.94.030  REVOCATION.



   The City Council may revoke any use permit subject to the procedures
established in Section 17.16.070 (Permit Revocation or Modification) in any
case where the conditions of the granting of such use permit or the
requirements of this chapter have not been complied with. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)

   A.   The city values its natural features as an integral part of the
city life. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that certain species of
trees and/or trees of a significant size are treated as important natural
features in the city. In general, healthy protected trees shall not be cut
down, removed or destroyed. In a situation where a protected tree(s) are
located on sites where development is proposed, protected trees are to be
given a high priority throughout the development process with a public
hearing and special findings required to remove a protected tree(s).



   B.   This chapter does not apply to trees in city parks and open
space, the unauthorized removal or damage to which is strictly prohibited
pursuant to Chapter 12.16 of this Municipal Code.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)



17.96.020  APPLICABILITY.



   Requirements in this chapter apply to protected trees as defined in the
Chapter 17.98 (Glossary of Terms). As outlined herein, a tree removal permit
is required prior to removal of protected trees within the City of Pinole.
(Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.96.030  PRUNING OF A PROTECTED TREE.



   The pruning of any protected tree shall be performed only when it
enhances its structural strength, health, general appearance or for safety
reasons. Any pruning must be either completed by a certified/consulting
arborist, or by the owner of protected tree who is following a plan created
by a certified/consulting arborist.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.96.040  PROTECTED TREE REMOVAL PERMIT APPLICATION.



   A.   Time of application.



      1.   Any person desiring to cut down, destroy or remove one
(1) or more protected trees on any undeveloped, vacant property or land under
development that requires a building permit in the city, shall file an
application for a tree removal permit application with the Community
Development Director. If the protected tree removal does not involve
development, the application shall be filed not less than ten (10) days prior
to the time desired for the physical removal of the protected tree.



      2.   If the protected tree removal does involve development,
the applicant shall file the application concurrently with the first
application for approval of the development. The applicant is strongly
encouraged to review the proposed development with the Community Development
Director to determine which protected trees could be preserved before design
drawings are begun.



   B.   Content of Application.



      1.   The application shall contain the precise number,
species, size and location of the protected tree(s) to be cut down, destroyed
or removed and a statement of the reason for removal, the signature of the
property owner authorizing such removal, the signature of the person actually
performing the work if different than the property owner and if known at the
time of the application, as well as any other pertinent information the
Community Development Director may require. The applicant shall submit five
(5) copies of drawing and a fee prescribed by City Council resolution to
cover the cost of investigation and processing.



      2.   If the tree removal involves development, the applicant
shall provide a tree survey plan specifying the precise location and dripline
of all existing trees (protected trees and non-protected trees) on the
property.



      3.   Unless the reason for the proposed removal of the
protected tree(s) is evident, (i.e. the protected tree is clearly dying) the
applicant shall also submit a certified or consulting arborist's report,
which shall include an evaluation of the protected tree(s) to be removed as
well as any appropriate recommendations concerning the preservation of any
surviving protected tree(s) on the property. The appraisal shall be done at
the applicant's sole expense, and the appraiser shall be subject to the
city's approval, which approval it shall not unreasonably withhold.  (Ord.
2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.96.050  REMOVAL OF PROTECTED TREE(S) DUE TO THE HEALTH OF THE TREE.



   A.   Review by Community Development Director. The Community
Development Director shall grant the permit if he or she makes either of the
following findings:



      1.   The condition of the protected tree(s) with respect to
disease, species, form, general health, damage, public nuisance, danger of
falling, proximity to existing structures, interference with utility
services, or damage to existing sidewalks and driveways warrants it's (their)
removal and such condition cannot reasonably be remedied through less drastic
means.



      2.   The protected tree(s) acts as a host for a parasitic
plant or insect which may endanger other protected tree(s) in the area and
cannot reasonably be controlled through less drastic means.



   B.   Conditions of Approval. Whenever any protected tree removal
permit is granted, the Community Development Director shall impose such
conditions as may be necessary to safeguard the public safety and the intent
of this chapter. A protected tree removal permit shall become null and void
if the privileges granted thereunder have not been utilized within one (1)
year from the effective date thereof. The conditions will be in addition to
those set forth in Section 17.96.060C.



   C.   Notice of the Decision. The decision of the Community
Development Director shall be mailed to the applicant within ten (10) working
days.



   D.   Notification to Planning Commission. After approving an
application for protected tree removal permit, the Community Development
Director shall advise the Planning Commission of his or her decision at their
next regular meeting.



   E.   Appeals. Any person may appeal the actions of the Community
Development Director to the Planning Commission by filing an appeal with the
City Clerk pursuant to the procedures set forth for a public hearing as
provided in Section 17.10.070. (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.96.060  PROTECTED TREE(S) REMOVAL PERMIT - AS PART OF A DEVELOPMENT.



   The protected tree(s) removal permit applications for protected trees
sought to be removed for development shall be considered by the body given
the authority to render the initial decision of said discretionary
development approval. In the event a protected tree is to be removed as a
consequence of a building permit issuance, the hearing body shall be the
planning commission.



   A.   Notice and hearing. A public hearing shall be required on that
portion of a protected tree(s) removal application requesting removal of any
protected tree(s) notice of the hearing shall be given in the manner
specified in Section 17.10.050 of this code. This notice may be consolidated
with any notice of public hearing required in conjunction with other aspects
of the development approval.



   B.   Findings. In approving any protected tree(s) removal permit,
the reviewing body, through its site and landscaping plan review, shall
endeavor to preserve all protected tree(s) to the extent possible. The
reviewing body may approve a protected tree removal permit for the removal of
a protected tree(s) only if it finds that the burden to the applicant in
preserving the protected tree(s) greatly outweighs the benefit to the public
and that preserving the protected tree(s) would severely reduce the scale or
feasibility of the development. In making the foregoing determinations, the
reviewing body shall consider such factors as the following:



      1.   The species, size, age, condition and value of the
protected tree.



      2.   Whether the protected tree has particular historical or
heritage value.



      3.   The visibility and value of the protected tree to the
neighborhood and the public.



      4.   The contribution of the protected tree to the character
of the site and the neighborhood.



      5.   Whether the development provides a public benefit.



      6.   The extent of hardship to the applicant in constructing
the development using a different design, size or on-site location.



      7.   Whether measures short of removing the protected tree can
be employed consistent with the development.



   C.   Conditions.



      1.   In approving the protected tree(s) removal permit, the
reviewing body may impose conditions for the purpose of protecting any
protected tree(s) which are to remain or to otherwise ensure compliance with
the intent and purpose of this chapter. The conditions will be in addition to
those set forth in Sections 17.96.080.B and 17.96.070.A.



      2.   If the reviewing body approves the removal of any
protected tree(s), the reviewing body may require as a condition of approval
that the applicant either:



         a.   Plant trees as part of the development over and
above the landscaping that would otherwise be required at a value equal to
the value of the protected tree(s) that will be removed; or



         b.   Pay an in-lieu fee to the city in an amount equal
to the value of the protected tree(s) that will be removed.



         c.   The Planning Commission may impose any other
condition they determine appropriate for the tree removal request.



      3.   As used in division a., the Community Development
Director shall determine the amount of “landscaping that would otherwise be
required” based on the standards stipulated in the Zoning Code. The value
of the protected tree(s) that will be removed shall be determined by the
value of each protected tree(s) to be removed as shown on the appraisal
provided with the application pursuant to this Section 17.96.050.B.  Any
in-lieu fees collected by the city pursuant to this section shall be used
only for the installation or replacement of trees in city parks or open space
or other areas of benefit to the city.



      4.   A copy of the decision and findings shall be mailed by
the secretary of the decision-making body acting on the application to the
applicant and to such other persons as shall so request in writing. A copy
shall also be kept on file in the Community Development Department.



   D.   Removal authorized. Approval of the protected tree(s) removal
plan indicating which, if any, protected tree(s) can be removed shall be used
by the Community Development Director to issue a protected tree(s) removal
permit for the purpose of this chapter. The tree removal permit, if granted,
shall entitle the applicant to remove only the protected tree(s) stated in
the plan.



   E.   Appeal. Any person may appeal the actions of the Planning
Commission to the City Council by filing an appeal with the City Clerk
pursuant to the procedures set forth for a public hearing as provided in
Section 17.40.030.C.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.96.070  PRESERVATION OF EXISTING PROTECTED TREES DURING DEVELOPMENT.



   A.   General Requirements. In addition to the conditions stipulated
in the tree removal permit, the following must regulations must be met as
standard conditions of approval:



      1.   Prior to and during any demolition, grading or
construction, all protected trees within a development area shall be
protected by a six (6) foot high chain link (or other material approved by
the Community Development Director) fence installed around the outside of the
dripline of each tree.



      2.   No oils, gas, chemicals, liquid waste, solid waste, heavy
construction machinery or other construction materials shall be stored or
allowed to stand within the dripline of any tree.



      3.   No equipment washout will be allowed to occur within the
dripline of any tree.



      4.   No signs or wires, except those needed for support of the
tree, shall be attached to any tree.



   B.   Damage to a protected tree. If any damage occurs to a protected
tree during construction, the owner, developer, contractor, or any agent
thereof shall immediately notify the Community Development Director so that
professional methods of treatment accepted by the Community Development
Director may be administered. The repair of the damage shall be at the
expense of the responsible party and shall be by professional standards,
approved by the Community Development Director. Failure to comply will result
in a stop work order.



   C.   The Community Development Director may require a
certified/consulting arborist be retained by the developer to be on-site at
such times during development as the Community Development Director
determines appropriate.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)



17.96.080  GUARANTEES FOR PROTECTED TREES REMAINING WITHIN DEVELOPMENT AREA.



   A.   Application. The requirements of this section apply to any
development whereby a protected tree will remain within the development area,
whether or not a tree removal permit has been issued to remove other
protected trees.



   B.   Guarantee Period.



      1.   Upon issuance of the first city permit, which authorizes
work on the site, the applicant shall guarantee the health of all protected
tree(s) to be preserved on the site. The health of all protected trees
required to remain on or in the vicinity of the site shall be guaranteed from
the date the guarantee is first filed with the Community Development Director
until three (3) years after the final inspection of the development or
issuance of the certificate of occupancy, if any, whichever is later. 



      2.   The guarantee shall include the applicant's agreement to
replace any protected tree, which is to be saved, but that dies during the
guarantee period with a tree of the same species as close in size as is
reasonably possible within such time and in such manner as is determined by
the Community Development Director.



   C.   Determination of loss/damage of protected tree. Upon
determination by the Community Development Director that a protected tree has
died through the fault of the applicant as determined under Section
17.96.080.B, pay to the city a civil penalty levied by the Community
Development Director for such protected tree in accordance with the
requirements of Section 17.96.090.  If any person performs any work within
the dripline of a protected tree which is not permitted by this chapter or
otherwise damages a protected tree in a manner which is not permitted by this
chapter or a protected tree permit, that person shall guarantee the health of
that protected tree for a period of five (5) years.  (Ord. 2010-02 § 1
(part), 2010)
