VILLAGE OF GRAYSLAKE, ILLINOIS MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the Village of Grayslake, Illinois 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Village of Grayslake, Illinois, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 2001, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2018-0-11, passed March 6, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

2.02.020 - Code of ethics for public officials and employees. 
A.  Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    "Business entity" means any business, proprietorship, firm, partnership, person in representative of fiduciary capacity, association, venture, trust, or corporation. 
    "Family member" means a spouse, children and grandchildren and their spouses, parents and the parents of a spouse, and brothers and sisters and their spouses. 
    "Interest" means any direct or indirect material benefit accruing to a public official or employee or their family members, whether in the public official's or employee's own name or the name of any person, from which the official or employee is entitled to receive any financial benefit, as a result of a contract or transaction which is or which is known will become the subject of an official act or action by or with the village, except for such contracts or transactions which by their terms and by the substance of their provisions confer the opportunity and right to realize the accrual of similar benefits to all other citizens of the village and except that benefits accruing to any business entity in which a public official or employee holds an ownership interest of less than seven and one-half percent shall not be deemed to be benefit accruing to such public official or employee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any interest permitted or prohibited under the Illinois Municipal Code, as amended from time to time, (65 ILCS 5/3-14-4), shall be permitted or prohibited under the same circumstances and conditions as therein set forth. 
    "Official act or action" means any legislative, administrative, appointive, or discretionary act of any public official or employee of the village or any board, committee, or commission thereof. 
    "Public official or employee" means any person, officer, or employee holding a position by election, appointment, or employment in the service of the village, whether paid or unpaid, including members of any board, committee, or commission thereof, provided, however, that independent contractors shall not be considered public officials or employees. Acts of any family member of a public official or employee, when done with the knowledge and express, implied, or tacit consent of the public official or employee, shall be deemed to be acts of such official or employee for purposes of applying the prohibitions and restrictions of this division. 
    "Transaction" means any matter, including but not limited to, contracts, work or business with the village, the sale or purchase of real estate by the village, and any requests for zoning amendments, variations, planned development approval, or special permits pending before the village, upon which a public official or employee performs an official act or action. 
B.  Declaration of Policy and Purpose. 
1.  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial, and responsive to the people they serve; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain or to advance the interests of family, relatives or friends; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established a code of ethics for all village public officials, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, and for village employees. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such public officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions which are incompatible with the best interests of the village and its inhabitants and by requiring disclosure by public officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the village. 
2.  The ordinance codified in this section is founded upon the principle that no individual shall receive any inordinate financial or other gain by reason of their service as a public official or employee of the village, and that no private party or taxpayer, including public officials or employees or their family members, should receive any benefits from village action beyond that which is available to any other private party or taxpayer due to their relation to or as a result of privileged information or support provided by any public official or employee. 
C.  Interest in Contracts or Transactions. 
1.  No public official or employee shall perform or participate in an official act or action with regard to a transaction in which he or she has or knows he or she will thereafter acquire an interest. 
2.  No public official or employee shall acquire an interest in or be affected by any transaction or the subject matter thereof at a time when the public official or employee believes or has reason to believe that such transaction will directly or indirectly be affected by an official act or action. 
D.  Gifts. No public official or employee shall accept from any person involved in any transaction with the village any present or future gift, favor, service, or thing of value as an inducement for an official act or action. 
E.  Disclosure of Information. No public official or employee with respect to any transaction which is or which is reasonably expected to become the subject of an official act or action, shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government, or affairs of the village or use such information to advance the interest of such public official or employee or his or her family members. 
F.  Appearance Before Village Boards, Etc. No public official or employee and no members of any board, committee, or commission on any matter within the jurisdiction of such board, committee, or commission shall appear on behalf of any private person or business entity, other than himself or herself, or a family member before any village board, committee, or commission. 
G.  Private Use of Public Property. No public official or employee shall request or permit the use of village-owned vehicles, equipment, materials, or property for personal convenience or profit except as allowed by administrative order of the village. 
H.  Special Treatment of Others. No public official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any person or business entity beyond that which is available to every other citizen. 
I.  Political Activities. 
1.  No appointment to or employment in any village position shall be dependent on political activity. 
2.  No employee shall be required to engage in any political activity as a condition of employment. 
J.  Disclosure of Interest.

B.  The village shall indemnify any person who was party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the village) by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer, employee or agent of the village against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the village and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment or settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the village, and with respect to any criminal action or proceedings had reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful.

D.  Any indemnification under subsections B and C of this section shall be made by the village only upon a determination that indemnification of the officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections B and C of this section. Such determination shall be made by the village by a majority vote of the elected officials of the village. 
E.  The indemnification provided in this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any contract or agreement, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 
F.  The village shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an officer, employee or agent of the village, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred in any such capacity, or arising out of their status as such, whether or not the village would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this section. 
(Prior code § 4.18) 
2.08.050 - Surety bonds. 
    Whenever a surety bond to indemnify the village is required as a prerequisite to exercising the duties of any office or position, or to the issuance of a license or permit or for the exercise of any special privilege, the surety on such bond shall be a corporation licensed and authorized to do business in the state as a surety company, in the absence of specific provision to the contrary by ordinance. Whenever in its opinion additional sureties or an additional surety may be needed on any bond to indemnify the village against any loss or liability because of the insolvency of the existing surety or sureties or for any other reason, the board of trustees may order a new surety or sureties to be secured on such bond. If such new surety or sureties are not procured within ten (10) days after the time such order is transmitted to the principal on the bond, or his or her assignee, the board shall declare the bond to be void, and such principal or assignee shall be deemed to have surrendered the privilege or position as condition of which the bond was required.

B.  Traffic Compliance Administrator Established. The police chief or his designee shall designate a traffic compliance administrator for the village. The function of traffic compliance administrator is hereby established, whose responsibilities include adopting, distributing and processing parking compliance notices and other notices required by Section 11-208.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-208.3, and to collect money paid as fines and penalties for violations of parking and compliance ordinances and, operate an administrative adjudication system and may make certified reports to the secretary of state under Section 625 ILCS 5/6-306.5. 
C.  Notice of Violation. A parking, standing, or compliance violation notice shall specify the date, time, and place of violation of a parking, standing, or compliance regulation; the particular regulation violated; any requirement to complete a traffic education program; the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance; the vehicle make and state registration number; and the identification number of the person issuing the notice. The violation notice shall state that the completion of any required traffic education program, the payment of any indicated fine, and the payment of any applicable penalty for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation. The notice also shall contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits. The violation notice shall specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had. 
D.  Service of Violation. Service of the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice shall be made by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he or she is present. A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking, standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service or in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or her control. A parking, standing, or compliance notice issued, signed and served in accordance with this section, a copy of the notice, or the computer generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings. 
E.  Hearing on Violation. Pursuant to this section, an opportunity shall be provided for a hearing for the registered owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice in which the owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under Section 625 ILCS 5/11-1306 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this section may be represented by counsel at their expense. 
F.  Additional Notices. Service of additional notices shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the secretary of state or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, or, under Section 625 ILCS 5/11-1306 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following sequence and shall include but not be limited to the information specified herein: 
1.  A second notice of parking, standing, or compliance violation shall specify the date and location of the violation cited in the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice, the particular regulation violated, the vehicle make and state registration number, any requirement to complete a traffic education program, the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a traffic education program, or both, the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits, and the time and manner in which the hearing may be had. The notice of violation shall also state that failure to complete a required traffic education program, to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated, and that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty, or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the village. 
2.  A notice of final determination of parking, standing, or compliance violation liability shall be sent following a final determination of parking, standing, or compliance violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this section. The notice shall state that the incomplete traffic education program or the unpaid fine or penalty, or both, is a debt due and owing the village. The notice shall contain warnings that failure to complete any required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the village, or both, within the time specified may result in the village filing a petition in the Circuit Court of Lake County to have the incomplete traffic education program or unpaid fine or penalty, or both, rendered a judgment as provided by this section. 
G.  Final Determination of Liability. A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to complete the required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination of violation liability shall become final either upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made. 
H.  Reserved. 
I.  Petition to Set Aside Determination. A petition to set aside a determination of parking, standing, compliance, or automated traffic law violation liability may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. A petition to set aside a determination of liability may also be filed by a person required to complete a traffic education program. The petition shall be filed with and ruled upon by the traffic compliance administrator in the manner and within the time specified by ordinance. The grounds for the petition are limited to: 
1.  The person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, 
2.  The person having already completed the required traffic education program or paid the fine or penalty, or both, for the violation in question, and 
3.  Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing after the determination of parking, standing, compliance, or automated traffic law violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation. 
J.  Procedures for Nonresidents. Nonresidents may contest the merits of an alleged violation without attending a hearing by submitting a completed and notarized nonresident request for hearing and nonappearance form to the hearing officer, if the following requirements are satisfied: 
1.  The nonresident must waive his right to personal appearance and indicate he is submitting to adjudication based on the notarized statement filed by him; 
2.  The form must be postmarked within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the violation notice was postmarked, attached to a vehicle or personally handed to the nonresident; and 
3.  The notarized statement must include a statement of facts specifying the grounds for challenging the violation notice. 
K.  Judgment on findings, decision, and order. 
1.  Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other action, or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures under the administrative review law shall be a debt due and owing the village, and as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation the Local Debt Recovery Program operated by the State of Illinois. 
2.  After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code violation, the village may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court of Lake County for purpose of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision, and order. Nothing in this section shall prevent the village from consolidating multiple findings, decisions, and orders against a person in such a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the village shall file a certified copy of the findings, decision, and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings, decision, and order was issued in accordance with Division 1-2.2 of the Illinois Municipal Code and this chapter. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided for by Section 2-203 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 735 ILCS 5/2-203, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines, other sanctions, and costs imposed by the findings, decision, and order does not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). If the court is satisfied that the findings, decision, and order was entered in accordance with the requirements of Division 1-2.2 of the Illinois Municipal Code and this chapter and that the defendant had an opportunity for a hearing under this chapter and for judicial review as provided in this chapter, the court shall render judgment in favor of the village and against the defendant for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and order, plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.

C.  Subpoenas; Defaults. At any time prior to the hearing date the hearing officer assigned to hear the case may, at the request of the building inspector or the attorney for the village, or the owner or his attorney, issue subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. If on the date set for hearing, the owner or his attorney fails to appear, the hearing officer may find the owner in default and shall proceed with the hearing and accept evidence relevant to the existence of a code violation. 
D.  Continuances-Representation at Code Hearings. No continuances shall be authorized by the hearing officer in proceedings under this chapter except in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the owner.

However, in no event shall the case for the village be presented by an employee of the code hearing department.

E.  Hearing; Evidence. At the hearing, a hearing officer shall preside and shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the existence or nonexistence of a code violation in the structure indicated.

F.  Eviction; Rights of the Occupants.

G.  Defenses to Violations of Title 15. It shall be a defense to a violation of Title 15 charged under this Section 2.72.090 if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent or representative proves to the hearing officer's satisfaction that: 
1.  The violation of Title 15 alleged in the notice does not in fact exist, or at the time of the hearing the violation has been remedied or removed; 
2.  The violation of Title 15 has been caused by the current property occupants and that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to maintain the dwelling free of such violations, the current occupants continue to cause the violations; 
3.  An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the owner or his agent to all or a part of the dwelling for the purpose of correcting the code violation. 
H.  Findings, Decision, Order. At the conclusion of the hearing the hearing officer shall make a determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing whether or not a code violation exists. The determination shall be in writing and shall be designated as findings, decision and order. The findings, decision and order shall include the hearing officer's findings of fact, a decision whether or not a code violation exists based upon the findings of fact, and shall order the owner to correct the violation or, if no violation is proved, shall order the dismissal of the case. If a code violation is proved, the order may also impose the sanctions that are provided in the code for the violation proved. The findings, decision, and order shall include a statement that the defendant may seek administrative review of the hearing officer's findings, decisions, and order pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Review Law. A copy of the findings, decision, and order shall be served on the owner within five days after they are issued; service shall be in the same manner as the report form and summons are served pursuant to subsection [B] of this section. Payment of any penalty or fine and the disposition of fine money shall be in the same manner as set forth in the Illinois Municipal Code. 
I.  Judgment on Findings, Decision, Order. 
1.  Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction or costs imposed remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures under the administrative review law shall be a debt due and owing the village and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation the Local Debt Recovery Program operated by the State of Illinois. 
2.  After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code violation, the village may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court of Lake County for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision and order. Nothing in this section shall prevent the village from consolidating multiple findings, decisions and orders against a person in such a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the village shall file a certified copy of the findings, decision and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings, decision and order was issued in accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-31.1-1 et seq. of the Illinois Compiled Statutes and this section. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by Section 2-203 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines, other sanctions and costs imposed by the findings, decision and order does not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). If the court is satisfied that the findings, decision and order were entered in accordance with the requirements of the applicable laws and ordinances, and that the property owner had an opportunity for a hearing under this chapter and for judicial review as provided in this chapter: (1) the court shall render judgment in favor of the village and against the property owner for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and order, plus costs. Such judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money; and (2) the court may also issue such other orders and injunctions as are requested by the village to enforce the order of the hearing officer to correct a code violation. 
J.  Sanctions Applicable to Owner-Property. The order to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the village as the result of a finding of a code violation under this chapter shall attach to the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of a code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner of property takes subject to the findings, decision and order of a hearing officer under this chapter. 
K.  Sanctions; Excessive Rental Units. 
1.  The owner of a building located in the village who, directly or indirectly, has collected, or caused to be collected, rentals from an occupant of that building during a period in which the number of apartments or family units in that building exceeded the number permitted for that building by an ordinance of the village, is liable to any such occupant in an amount equal to not more than three times the amount of any rentals paid by any such occupant, or in his behalf, after January 1, 1970, together with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. If the occupant is a recipient of public aid under Article III, IV, or VI of "the Illinois Public Aid Code," 305 ILCS 5/3-1 et seq., as amended, in whose behalf vendor payment of the rental was made by the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Department of Human Services (acting as successor to the Department of Public Aid under the Department of Human Services Act), or a local governmental unit, as the case may be, the liability as herein provided is to the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Department of Human Services (acting as successor to the Department of Public Aid under the Department of Human Services Act, 20 ILCS 1305/1 et seq.), or the local governmental unit making the vendor payment of the rental. 
2.  For the purposes of this section, "family unit" means a room or group of rooms used or intended to be used as a housekeeping unit for living, sleeping, cooking and eating. The fact that any such family unit is used or intended to be used with cooking or eating accommodations in common with another family unit in any such building does not affect liability hereunder. 
3.  No liability accrues under this section until thirty (30) days after the owner of record of a building has been notified in writing that such owner is in violation of any such municipal ordinance. Such notice shall be personally served upon such owner of record or sent by registered mail to the last known address of such owner. 
L.  A person who contracts with the federal government or any of its agencies, including without limitation the department of housing and urban development, to care for vacant residential real estate shall be responsible for maintaining the property to prevent and correct municipal health and safety code violations.

    Nothing in this section shall be construed or applied to require the village to enter into any installment agreement. 
I.  Voluntary Disclosure. 
1.  Application. A taxpayer may file an application, on a form prepared by the village, with the village tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due for any village tax that a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the village tax administrator.

Except for the payment of the full amount of tax and interest due under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application shall not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed; provided, however, that if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due as provided in this section, then the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax.

L.  Penalties. 
1.  Late Filing and Payment Penalty. If a return is filed late, then the taxpayer shall pay a penalty for such late filing of five percent of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return. If the taxpayer makes a late payment, then the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of five percent of the tax due and not timely paid or remitted. Late filing and payment penalties shall not apply to a particular taxpayer if, but only if, a failure to file penalty is imposed on that taxpayer by the village. The village tax administrator may determine, in the sole exercise of his or her sound judgment, that the late filing or late payment was due to a reasonable cause and abate some or all the penalty. 
2.  Failure to File Penalty. If no return is filed before the issuance of a notice of tax deficiency or of tax liability to the taxpayer, then the penalty for such failure to file shall be twenty-five (25) percent of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to have been filed. A village tax administrator may determine, in the sole exercise of his or her sound judgment, that the failure to file a return was due to reasonable cause and abate some or all of the penalty. 
3.  Additional Penalties. In the event that any taxpayer noncompliance with the provisions of a village tax is result of wilful or fraudulent disregard of the village tax laws, such taxpayer shall be additionally subject to the general penalty provisions of this village code (including any criminal penalties) and, in addition, shall be liable in a civil action for the full amount of the tax due plus the applicable amount of interest.

Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.

C.  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.

Any display of alcoholic liquor for retail in the original package shall not exceed an area of thirty-six (36) square feet in the licensed premises and no advertising of retail sales of package goods shall be carried on other than the price of the package being attached to the display area.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, limited meal service, such as provided by lounges, luncheonettes, diners, coffee shops, drive-ins, etc., does not satisfy the requirements for this license classification. Notwithstanding the restrictions in this subsection requiring sale and service of alcoholic beverages at a table, any cafeteria-type operation that serves meals as defined in this chapter may qualify for a Class "R-3" license issued hereunder if other applicable provisions of this chapter are met.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, limited meal service, such as provided by lounges, luncheonettes, diners, coffee shops, drive-ins, etc., does not satisfy the requirements for this license classification. Any cafeteria-type operation that serves meals as defined in this chapter may qualify for a Class "R-4" license issued hereunder if other applicable provisions of this chapter are met. Each licensee selling and serving alcoholic liquor under a Class "R-4" license issued hereunder shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this section and all law enforcement officers in enforcing the provisions of this chapter shall likewise be so governed.

b.  The grantee must make cable television service available to at least fifty (50) percent of the dwelling units within the service area within one year from the date of the award of the franchise. 
2.  The grantee, in its application, may propose a timetable of construction which will make cable television service available in the service area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case said schedule will be made part of the franchise agreement, and will be binding upon the grantee. 
3.  Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically approved by the village, will be considered a violation of this chapter for which the provisions of either Sections 5.20.390 or 5.20.470 shall apply, as determined by the village. 
4.  In special circumstances and for good cause shown by the grantee, the village, in the exercise of its sole discretion, may waive one hundred (100) percent completion within the two-year time frame, provided that substantial completion is accomplished within the allotted time frame, substantial completion to be not less than ninety-five (95) percent. Justification for less than one hundred (100) percent must be submitted subject to the approval of the village. 
B.  Line Extensions. 
1.  In areas of the franchise territory not initially served, a grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. To expedite the process of extending the cable system into a new subdivision, the village will forward to the grantee an approved engineering plan of each project. Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall commence the design and construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan. Upon notification from the village that the first home in the project has been approved for a building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three months to complete the construction/activation process within the applicable project phase, barring any unforeseen adverse weather or ground conditions. 
b.  The grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to every dwelling unit in all unserved, developing areas having at least twenty-five (25) dwelling units planned per street mile, as measured from the existing system, and shall extend its system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines. 
c.  The grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to any isolated resident outside the initial service area requesting connection at the standard connection charge, if the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a standard one hundred twenty-five (125) foot drop line. 
2.  In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service, the grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate of the grantee's costs required to extend service to the subscriber. The grantee shall then extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The grantee may require advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to the grantee. In the event the area subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be refunded to the subscriber. 
3.  In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, all cable system facilities also shall be placed underground, except as otherwise specifically approved in advance by the village. If the grantee receives notice of such new construction or property development, including the date on which open trenching is available for the grantee's work (the "notice"), then the grantee shall provide, to the developer or property owner and to the village, the specifications for its trenching and the grantee shall install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within five working days after the trenches first become available to the grantee for such work. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; provided, however, that if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within said five working days, then the cost of any new trenching, and easements if necessary, shall be borne by the grantee. The notice may be given to the grantee at the address stated in the franchise agreement or to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee. Written or oral notice from the developer, property owner, or village shall be sufficient to qualify as the notice. 
C.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving areas of the village not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners, residents, or businesses, provided that all applicable fees are paid by the grantee to the village therefor, including without limitation the franchise fee provided in this chapter. 
D.  A grantee, in its new or renewal application, may propose a line extension policy that will result in serving more residents of the village than as required above, in which case the grantee's policy will be incorporated into the franchise agreement and will be binding on the grantee. 
E.  The violation of this section shall be considered a violation of this chapter for which the provisions of either Sections 5.20.390 or 5.20.470 shall apply, as determined by the village. 
(Ord. 97-0-41 § 2 (part): prior code § 17.21) 
5.20.220 - Construction and technical standards. 
A.  The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner consistent with all laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, and FCC technical standards.

d.  Applicable FCC or other federal, state and local regulations. 
3.  In any event, the system shall not endanger or interfere with the safety of persons or property in the franchise area or other areas where the grantee may have equipment located. 
4.  Any antenna structure used in the system shall comply with construction, marking, and lighting of antenna structure, required by the United States Department of Transportation. 
5.  All working facilities and conditions used during construction, installation and maintenance of the system shall comply with the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
6.  The grantee regularly shall check radio frequency leakage at reception locations for emergency radio services to prove that no interference signal combinations are possible. Stray radiation shall be measured adjacent to any proposed aeronautical navigation radio sites to prove no interference to airborne navigational reception in the normal flight patterns. FCC rules and regulations shall govern. 
7.  The grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby power for head end, transportation and trunk amplifiers for a minimum of two hours. 
8.  In all areas of the village where the cables, wires and other like facilities of public utilities are placed underground, all cables, wires and other like facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date of the grantee's franchise shall be placed underground. When public utilities relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the grantee shall concurrently do so at no expense to the village. 
C.  Plans and Permits. 
1.  Right to review-Briefings. 
a.  The village shall have the right to review the grantee's construction plans and specifications prior to the commencement of any new construction to assure compliance with the standards specified in this chapter and to inspect all aspects of cable system construction. The village shall not, however, be required to review or approve such plans and specifications or to make such inspections, and the village specifically disclaims such obligation. The grantee shall be solely responsible for taking all steps necessary to assure compliance with such standards and to ensure that the cable system is installed in a safe manner and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
b.  Before beginning new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, the grantee's chief engineer or designated individual shall meet with the village administrator or designated individual to explain the grantee's construction plans and work program in detail. Similar briefings shall be held from time to time as deemed necessary by either the village or the grantee until the work is completed. 
2.  The grantee shall, within ninety (90) days after the effective date of its franchise, furnish to the village complete "as-built" plans of the cable system and shall, thereafter, furnish to the village amendments to such plans within forty-five (45) days after completion of any extension or modification of the cable system. If so requested by the grantee, the village shall keep such as-built plans confidential to the extent allowable by law, and shall show such plans only to those employees, contractors or village officials who need to see them as a part of their responsibilities to the village, or pursuant to their J.U.L.I.E. responsibilities. 
3.  The grantee shall obtain permits from the village before commencing any new construction of or within the cable system, with specific permission being required for the opening or disturbance of any public way within the village. The permit application shall include a plan drawn in sufficient detail to demonstrate to the village that the cable system will be constructed in accordance with all applicable codes and ordinances. Where cable is to be installed on existing poles, the permit application shall include a drawing showing the existing poles and additional poles, if requested. Without characterizing the violation of other provisions of this chapter, the failure to obtain said permits shall constitute a material violation of this chapter. The grantee also, before the commencement of new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, shall become and remain a member of the J.U.L.I.E. system. 
D.  All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, and removal of the cable system, or any part thereof, shall be performed in a workmanlike manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the village or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any part of the cable system, including without limitation any means used to distribute signals over or within the cable system, is harmful to the health or safety of any person, then the grantee, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly correct all such conditions. Any contractor, subcontractor, or other person proposed to be employed for the installation, maintenance, relocation, or repair of cable system equipment or facilities shall be licensed in accordance with applicable laws and shall be thoroughly experienced in the work for which he or she is retained. 
E.  Unless expressly provided otherwise in the franchise, the grantee shall at all times comply with any and all rules and regulations enacted or to be enacted by the village with reference to construction activity in public ways. All poles, wires, conduits, cables, equipment, pipes, appurtenances, structures, and other facilities of the cable system shall be installed and located in compliance with all applicable village codes and ordinances and the applicable provisions of the franchise so as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of the general public, all as determined by the village in its sole and absolute discretion. Unless the village shall in writing waive its right to review plans, no construction or other work relating to such facilities within the public ways of the village shall be commenced until the village shall have approved and issued a permit on the plans, specifications and methods for such work. Any such permit may be so conditioned or restricted as deemed necessary by the village to assure compliance with the franchise and to protect the public health and safety. All such facilities shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe condition and in good order and repair. The grantee shall at all times employ reasonable care and shall install, maintain, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injuries or nuisances to the general public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices shall be used at such times and places as are required by applicable ordinances and at such additional times and places as are required for the safety of all members of the general public. Any such facilities placed in any public way by the grantee shall be placed and maintained in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel or other existing or projected uses of such public way. 
F.  Excavation Work and Time Periods. 
1.  No excavation on or in any public way, public property or private property in the village permitted hereunder in connection with the installation of any cable system facilities shall be made more than twenty-four (24) hours immediately before installation of such facilities. The grantee may apply for a waiver in unusual circumstances. 
2.  The grantee shall notify the village administrator at least seventy-two (72) hours before any excavation on or in any public way, public property or private property so that the village administrator will have the opportunity to inspect such excavation work. 
3.  All excavations in lawns or grassy parkways shall be promptly backfilled, tamped and restored with sod in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter. 
G.  Location of Pedestals and Vaults. 
1.  Pedestals and Similar Above-Ground Appurtenances. 
a.  The village has determined that pedestals and similar above-ground appurtenances located on a public way (other than in an alley or as provided in subsection (G)(1)(c) of this section or on public property will adversely affect the appearance of the village and of the property therein and, accordingly, pursuant to Section 541(a)(2) of the Cable Act, the grantee shall not under any circumstances install or locate a pedestal or any similar above-ground appurtenance on any public way (other than in an alley or as provided in subsection (G)(1)(c) of this section) or on any public property as a part of any new construction or any relocation or reinstallation. 
b.  Pedestals or similar above-ground appurtenances may be installed on private property only with the express, prior written consent and permission of the affected property owner or his or her authorized agent, or the duly elected or appointed representative of the affected property; provided, however, that such pedestals or above ground appurtenances shall comply with all applicable provisions of this code. 
c.  Notwithstanding subsection (G)(1)(b) of this section, pedestals or similar above-ground appurtenances may be installed within certain utility easements on private property without the consent or permission of the affected property owner provided that (i) the grantee is lawfully authorized to use such utility easement pursuant to state or federal law; (ii) no such pedestal or similar above-ground appurtenance may be installed unless, at the time of the desired installation, there exists within the utility easement, a similar above-ground appurtenance of another utility company or entity; and (iii) the grantee's pedestal or similar above-ground appurtenance shall be located as close as is practicable to said existing above-ground appurtenance. 
2.  Vaults. 
a.  The grantee shall not install underground vaults on any public way after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, except in accordance with and pursuant to the provisions of subsection (G)(2)(d) of this section. All underground vaults shall be flush mounted with the surface of the land area. 
b.  The grantee shall inform the owner of any private property in the village where the grantee contemplates placing a vault on the parkway immediately adjacent to said private property, that the owner has the right to elect between the construction and installation of an underground vault on the owner's private property or on the public way (including, without limitation, the parkway) immediately adjacent to the owner's property. Said notice shall be in writing, in form and substance acceptable to the village administrator, and delivered by certified mail or personal delivery to said owner at least thirty (30) days immediately before the commencement of construction on or around the owner's property. 
c.  If the owner elects to allow construction and installation of an underground vault on the owner's property, then the owner shall be required to grant the grantee an easement, in form reviewed and approved by the village attorney, allowing for such construction and installation. 
d.  If the owner (i) elects not to allow construction and installation of an underground vault on the owner's property; or (ii) fails to respond to the election notice delivered by the grantee pursuant to subsection (G)(2)(b) of this section within forty-five (45) days after the owner receives the notice; or (iii) refuses to grant the grantee the easement pursuant to subsection (G)(2)(c) of this section within thirty (30) days after the owner's receipt of an easement document, then the grantee shall be entitled to construct and install an underground vault on the public way (including, without limitation, the parkway) that is immediately adjacent to the owner's property. 
(Ord. 97-0-41 § 2 (part): prior code § 17.22) 
5.20.230 - Use of streets. 
A.  The grantee's system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets and public ways, or interfere with any improvements the village may make, or hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property. 
B.  In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, landscaping, driveway or other surfacing, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the village, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley disturbed, in at least as good condition as before the work was commenced and in accordance with standards for such work set by the village. If, after thirty (30) days, restoration measures are not performed to the reasonable satisfaction of the village, the village may undertake remedial restoration activities, such activities to be performed at the grantee's cost, with such costs to be chargeable against the security deposit required of the grantee in Section 5.20.140 of this chapter. 
C.  Erection, Removal and Common Uses of Poles. 
1.  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the village with regard to location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the village determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
2.  Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the village are available for use by the grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the village may require the grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and reasonable. 
3.  Where the village or a public utility serving the village desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the village may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the village shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the village determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations. 
D.  If at any time during the period of the franchise the village shall elect to alter, or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways or utilities, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the village, shall promptly remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense. 
E.  The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
F.  The grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any portion, either above, at or below ground level, of any tree within any public place without the prior consent of the village. The grantee shall provide notice to any affected residents at the same time that the grantee applies to the village for consent to perform tree trimming. The village shall have the right to do the trimming requested by the grantee at the cost of the grantee. Regardless of who performs the work requested by the grantee, the grantee shall be responsible, shall defend and hold village harmless from any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the property surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed. 
G.  The grantee shall not use road cuts for the laying of cable or wires without the prior approval of the village. 
H.  The right of the grantee to use and occupy the public ways shall not be exclusive. The village reserves the right to grant any right or use of such public ways to any person at any time during the term of the franchise or any other franchise subsequently granted to any other person. 
I.  If any public way or portion thereof used by the grantee shall be vacated by the village, or the use thereof discontinued by the village or the grantee, during the term of the franchise, then the grantee shall forthwith at its sole cost and expense remove its facilities therefrom unless specifically permitted to continue to use the same and, on the removal thereof, the grantee shall restore, repair, or reconstruct the public way area where such removal has occurred to its original condition as required by the village. In the event of any failure, neglect, or refusal by the grantee, after thirty (30) days written notice from the village to repair, improve, or maintain such public way, the village may, but shall be under no obligation to, conduct such work, or cause it to be conducted, and the actual cost thereof shall be paid by the grantee in the time and manner as directed by the village. Collection may be made by resort to the letter of credit or cash security deposit established pursuant to Section 5.20.140 of this chapter, or by court action, or otherwise.

5.20.240 - Operational standards. 
A.  The grantee shall maintain all parts of the system in good condition throughout the entire franchise period. 
B.  Upon the reasonable request for service by any person located within the franchise territory, the grantee shall, within thirty (30) days, furnish the requested service to such person within terms of the line extension policy. A request for service shall be unreasonable for the purpose of this subsection if no trunk line installation capable of servicing that person's block has been installed. 
C.  Temporary Service Drops. 
1.  The grantee shall put forth every effort to bury temporary drops within ten (10) working days after placement. Any delays for any other reason than listed will be communicated to the village. The following delays will be found understandable and within the course of doing business: weather, ground conditions, street bores, system redesign requirements and any other unusual obstacle, such as obstructive landscaping that is created by the customer. 
2.  Upon request of the village the grantee shall provide a monthly report to the village on the number of drops pending.

(Ord. 97-0-41 § 2 (part): prior code § 17.24) 
5.20.250 - Customer service standards. 
A.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the enforcement of any federal, state or local law or regulation concerning customer service or consumer protection that imposes customer service standards or consumer protection requirements that exceed the customer service standards set out in this chapter or that address matters not addressed in this chapter. 
B.  The grantee shall maintain a local or toll-free telephone access line which is available to its subscribers and shall have knowledgeable, qualified representatives available to respond to customer telephone inquiries twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven days per week. Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time, including wait time and the time required to transfer the call, shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds.

Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a busy signal less than three percent of the time. 
C.  Customer service centers and bill payment locations will be open for walk-in customer transactions a minimum of eight hours per day Monday through Friday, unless there is a need to modify those hours because of the location or customers served. The grantee and village by mutual consent shall establish supplemental hours on weekdays and weekends as fits the needs of the community. 
D.  Under normal operating conditions, each of the following standards will be met no less than ninety-five (95) percent of the time as measured on an annual basis. 
1.  Standard installations will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed. A standard installation is one that is within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of the existing system. 
2.  Excluding those situations that are beyond its control, the grantee will respond to any service interruption promptly and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours from the time of initial notification. All other regular service requests will be responded to within thirty-six (36) hours during the normal work week for that system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be: "morning" or "afternoon"; not to exceed a four-hour "window" during normal business hours for the system, or at a time that is mutually acceptable. The grantee shall schedule supplemental hours during which appointments can be scheduled based on the needs of the community. If at any time an installer or technician is running late, an attempt to contact the customer will be made and the appointment rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the customer. 
E.  In the event of a service interruption, the following standards for subscriber credits shall be applied by the grantee: 
1.  If a subscriber experiences a service interruption totaling four hours or more on one, two, or three days in any calendar month, then the grantee shall provide a credit to that subscriber equal to one-thirtieth of one month's total fees paid by that subscriber for each day on which such a service interruption occurs; provided, however, that such credit shall not apply to a subscriber disconnected because of nonpayment or excessive signal leakage. Such credit shall be provided by the grantee automatically upon notice from that subscriber of such service interruption, regardless of whether that subscriber requests a credit. 
2.  If a subscriber experiences a service interruption totaling four hours or more on four or more days in any calendar month, then the grantee shall provide a credit to that subscriber equal to one month's total fees paid by that subscriber; provided, however, that such credit shall not apply to a subscriber disconnected because of nonpayment or excessive signal leakage. Such credit shall be provided by the grantee automatically upon notice from that subscriber of the fourth such service interruption, regardless of whether that subscriber requests a credit. 
F.  The grantee shall provide written information for each of the following areas at the time of installation and at any future time upon the request of the customer: 
1.  Product and services offered; and 
2.  Prices and service options; and

4.  How to use the cable television services. 
G.  Bills will be clear, concise and understandable, with all charges for cable services itemized. 
H.  A grantee may not impose a late, administrative or other fee on a customer for nonpayment of a bill until thirty (30) days have elapsed after the end of the billing cycle which is the subject of the unpaid bill. 
I.  Credits will be issued promptly, but no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the resolution of the request and the return of the equipment by the grantee if service has been terminated. 
J.  The grantee shall notify customers a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of any rate or channel change. 
K.  The grantee shall maintain and operate its network in accordance with the rules and regulations incorporated herein and as may be promulgated by state or federal regulators. 
L.  The grantee shall continue, through the term of the franchise, to maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this chapter and the franchise. Should the village find, by resolution, that the grantee has failed to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, and should it, by resolution, specifically enumerate improvements to be made, the grantee shall make such improvements. Failure to make such improvements within three months of such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which penalties contained in Section 5.20.470 are applicable. 
M.  The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which indicates the nature of each service complaint received in the last twenty-four (24) months, the date and time each complaint was received; the disposition of each complaint, and the time and date thereof. This log shall be sent to the village monthly upon request. 
N.  The grantee shall provide a copy of the customer service standards included in this section to every subscriber via a bill insert at least once every calendar year. The grantee shall also provide a copy of these customer service standards to every new customer within thirty (30) days of connection. 
(Ord. 97-0-41 § 2 (part): prior code § 17.25) 
5.20.260 - Continuity of service mandatory. 
A.  It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service as long as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the village gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances for a period not to exceed six months after the franchise has terminated. 
B.  If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator acquires the system, the grantee shall cooperate with the village, new franchisee and operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
C.  If the grantee fails to operate the system for three consecutive days without prior approval of the village or without just cause, the village may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the village or a permanent operator is selected. If the village is required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the village shall be entitled to all revenues for any period during which it operates the system and shall be entitled to draw on the letter of credit and cash security deposit established pursuant to Section 5.20.140 of this chapter to recover all of its costs and damages in excess of such revenues, and, in any event, the grantee shall be obligated to reimburse the village for all costs or damages incurred by the village resulting from the grantee's failure to perform that the village does not recover from such revenues or said letter of credit or cash security deposit. 
(Ord. 97-0-41 § 2 (part): prior code § 17.26) 
5.20.270 - Complaint procedure. 
A.  During the term of the franchise and any renewal thereof, the grantee shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and similar matters.

C.  When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists other evidence, which, in the judgment of the village, in consultation with the grantee, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the village shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the village in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested, within thirty (30) days after notice. Such report shall include the following information: 
1.  The nature of the complaint or problem that precipitated the special tests; and 
2.  The system component(s) tested; and 
3.  The equipment used and procedures employed in testing; and 
4.  The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved; and 
5.  Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required. 
D.  If, after receiving grantee's report, and alter the grantee has completed any corrective action identified in the report, the village determines that reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate system performance, then the village may enlist an independent engineer at grantee's expense to perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected failures to meet the requirements of this chapter. Grantee shall cooperate and permit such testing. 
E.  The village shall require tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence only when the village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service.

C.  The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on a calendar year basis to the village within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter. The grantee shall also file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts as previously defined within said thirty (30) days.

If any audit discloses an underpayment of a franchise fee by an amount in excess of five percent of the applicable fee, then the grantee shall pay the full cost of the audit The grantee shall maintain books and records of its operations within and related to the village and the grantee's cable system in sufficient detail to show gross revenue, by service category, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Said books and records shall be retained in accordance with the grantee's document retention policies, but in no event less than five years. 
E.  If any franchise payment or re-computed amount, cost or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at an annual rate of twelve (12) percent. 
F.  The acceptance by the village of any franchise fee payment shall not in any way be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim the village may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of the franchise. All franchise fee payments shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the village in accordance with this section. 
G.  The grantee shall acknowledge as follows: 
1.  The franchise fee is not a tax; and 
2.  The franchise fee shall be in addition to any and all taxes, other fees or charges that the grantee or any affiliate shall be required to pay to the village or to any state or federal agency or authority, all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of the grantee and its affiliates; and 
3.  Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall have or make any claim for any deduction or other credit of all or any part of the franchise fee from or against any of said village taxes or other fees or charges that the grantee or any affiliate is required to pay to the village except as may be identified and authorized by federal law; and 
4.  Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall apply or seek to apply all or any part of the franchise fee as a deduction or other credit from or against any of said village taxes or other fees or charges, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and distinct obligations of the grantee and its affiliates. 
5.  Except as authorized by law, if the grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks to apply all or any part of the amount of the franchise fee as a deduction or other credit from or against any village tax or other fee or charge, or if the grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks to apply all or any part of any such tax or other fee or charge as a deduction or other credit from or against the franchise fee, then, in any such event, the village may revoke the franchise pursuant to the applicable provisions of this chapter without any liability to the grantee or any affiliate. 
H.  The village may increase the franchise fee if and to the extent that the maximum allowable franchise fee is increased by the FCC. If the village desires to increase the franchise fee in that event, then the village shall provide at least thirty (30) days written notice to the grantee. If, within thirty (30) days after the village's notice, the grantee so requests, the village shall conduct a public hearing on the franchise fee increase. The effective date of the proposed franchise fee increase shall be delayed until the expiration of the thirty (30) day notice period, if within that period the grantee does not request a hearing, or if a hearing is requested, until the conclusion of the public hearing conducted pursuant to this section.

5.20.300 - Transfer of ownership or control. 
A.  Except as provided in Subsection F of this section, a franchise shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet, hypothecated, or mortgaged, either in whole or in part, in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written approval of the village. The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, providing that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. Any proposed assignee must show legal, technical and financial responsibility as determined by the village and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The grantee shall submit a petition to the village requesting the village's approval at least ninety (90) days before the grantee takes any action in furtherance of accomplishing any such assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage, containing or accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the village. The village shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of any such assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage. The village shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within one hundred twenty (120) days following receipt of said petition and receipt of all necessary information as to the effect of the proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage upon the public, unless the requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The village shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer. 
B.  The grantee shall promptly notify the village of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as used in this section is not limited to major stockholders but also includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of five percent of the voting shares of the grantee. Change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee without the village's consent shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the village may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the village in such inquiry. 
C.  The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the village in and to any public way, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
D.  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village shall not be required to approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system. 
E.  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor(s) in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
F.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any assignment, pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage, or other transfer of all or any part of the grantee's cable system, or any right or interest therein, solely for financing purposes, provided that each such assignment, pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage, or other transfer shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the village pursuant to this chapter, the franchise agreement, and applicable law.

The grantee shall not make use of any channel reserved for use pursuant to this subsection. 
C.  If the grantee receives its franchise within the village pursuant to an agreement negotiated as part of a collective process among, and the grantee's system thus serves, the village and other franchising authorities including the villages of Grayslake, Mundelein, and Wauconda and the county of Lake (collectively the "authorities"), then the grantee shall maintain at least five channels of its system exclusively available as follows:

    For any system that serves the village and other franchising authorities as described in this subsection and that has the capacity for any number of channels greater than eighty-five (85), the grantee shall provide, in addition to the channels otherwise required pursuant to this subsection, two specially designated noncommercial channels for the exclusive use of the village and other local governmental, educational, and public authorities, subject to the conditions set forth in the next two sentences. Such two additional channels shall be provided immediately upon notice from the village of sufficient demand therefor. For purposes of this requirement, the phrase "sufficient demand" means that four of the five specially designated noncommercial channels otherwise required pursuant to this subsection are used for original, noncommercial public, educational, and governmental access video programming not less than an average of six hours per day, five days each week, over a period of forty-five (45) days. 
    The grantee shall not make use of any channel reserved for use pursuant to this subsection; provided, however, that the grantee may use the two channels described in the immediately preceding paragraph but only until receipt of notice from the village pursuant to the second sentence of the preceding paragraph. 
D.  Studios and associated production equipment will be located in a mutually agreed upon site to meet the public's need for public access, and to accommodate the specially designated channels described in this paragraph.

1.  The grantee shall, on request by the village, connect its cable system within the village to any cable system that is owned or operated by the grantee or any affiliate or subsidiary of the grantee in any contiguous municipality. 
2.  The village also may request that the grantee interconnect its system with other communication facilities within or contiguous to the village. Such interconnection shall be negotiated by the village and the grantee. Upon receiving a request from the village to so interconnect, the grantee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both construction and operation of the interconnection link. 
    The grantee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect, or the village shall rescind its request to interconnect, upon petition by the grantee to the village, if the grantee has negotiated in good faith and has arrived at impasse with the operator or franchising authority of the system to be interconnected, or that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates, or that the interconnection is technically infeasible. 
3.  The grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority, municipality, or county, state, or federal regulatory agency that may be hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the village.

Such application shall include the names and addresses of all such individuals who will solicit and shall conform to the requirements of Section 5.52.040(A)(2), (4), (5), (10), (11) and (19).

G.  Protective Clothing. Every person engaged in charitable solicitation on any public right-of-way within the village shall wear a high-visibility vest or other high-visibility clothing at all times while engaged in such solicitation. 
H.  State Registration. Every business or organization represented by a solicitor engaged in charitable solicitation on any public right-of-way within the village shall be registered with the Illinois Attorney General as a charitable organization pursuant to the Illinois Solicitation for Charity Act, 225 ILCS 460/0.01 et seq. 
I.  Liability. Every solicitor engaged in charitable solicitation on any public right-of-way within the village, and the business or organization represented by the solicitor, shall be liable for all injuries to any person or property that occurs during or as a result of the solicitation and that is causally related to an act of ordinary negligence of the solicitor or the business or organization the solicitor represents. 
J.  Insurance. Before engaging in any charitable solicitation pursuant to this chapter, the solicitor shall provide to the chief of police a certificate of insurance issued by an insurance company licensed to do business in Illinois indicating that the insurance company will insure the solicitor and the business or organization represented by the solicitor against any injury to any person or property during the solicitation that is causally related to an act of ordinary negligence of the solicitor or of the business or organization represented by the solicitor. Such certificate of insurance shall name the village as an additional insured, shall state that the insurance policy shall not be amended or cancelled during the period of the permitted solicitation, and shall reflect that at least the following coverage has been provided:

K.  Solicitation in Public Rights-of-Way by Village Law Enforcement Personnel. 
1.  Village law enforcement personnel or other persons employed by or serving the village to protect the public safety that desire to engage in solicitation for a charitable organization in the designated vehicular lanes of any public roadway, must no later than ten (10) days prior to the requested dates of solicitation, submit a supplemental application to the chief of police stating in full the following additional information: (a) the name of the charitable organization for which the solicitation will be conducted; (b) the location or locations, including all public roadways, on which the solicitation will occur along with a list of three (3) alternate locations listed in order of preference; (c) the manner and conditions under which the solicitation is to occur; (d) the dates and times for the proposed solicitation; and (e) proof that the charitable organization for which the solicitation will be conducted maintains in effect the insurance coverage specified in Subsection 5.52.080J of this Chapter 5.52. 
2.  Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Chapter 5.52, the chief of police shall issue a solicitation permit to any village law enforcement personnel or other persons employed by or serving the village to protect the public safety that desire to engage in solicitation for a charitable organization in the designated vehicular lanes of any public roadway no later than five (5) business days after receiving a full, accurate, complete, and qualifying application and supplemental application as required by this Chapter 5.52. The chief of police may impose reasonable conditions in writing that are consistent with the intent of this section and are based on articulated public safety concerns. If the municipality determines that the applicant's location cannot be permitted due to significant safety concerns, such as high traffic volumes, poor multi- lane geometrics, construction, maintenance operations, or past accident history, then the municipality may deny the application for that location and must approve one of the three (3) alternate locations following the order of preference submitted by the applicant on the alternate location list, subject to such conditions as may be imposed consistent with public safety concerns. Upon request of an applicant, additional alternate locations may be proposed in order to obviate public safety concerns or to proceed without conditions that otherwise would apply to the initially identified alternate locations. 
3.  Other persons desiring to engage in solicitation for a charitable organization in the designated vehicular lanes of any public roadway may do so in the manner prescribed sections 5.52.080(K)(1), (2), and (4), provided that the chief of police may require an organization to submit a satisfactory statement setting forth: (a) public safety and/or law enforcement training for the individuals who will be participating in the charitable solicitation: and (b) the safety devices and safety procedures to be utilized, including the procedures to ensure the safety of the individuals who will be participating in the charitable solicitation and the public in and around the vehicular lanes of any public roadway where the proposed solicitation will occur. 
4.  Due to significant safety concerns, including without limitation high traffic volumes, poor geometrics, poor multi-lane geometrics, construction, maintenance operations, and/or past accident history, the village board has determined that the following locations have been deemed inappropriate for solicitation at the times designated:

Chapter 12.16 - TREE PRESERVATION 
Sections: 

12.16.010 - Findings and determinations. 
    It is found and determined: 
A.  It is the public policy of the village to maintain and preserve, to the greatest extent possible, existing trees within the village. Trees contribute to the scenic beauty of the village and increase property values while enhancing the quality of life within the village. Trees also tend to soften the rough edges of developments and reduce the visual effects of suburbanization by creating a natural setting. 
B.  The preservation of individual trees and wooded areas provides desired environmental effects such as: acting as a barrier to noise, helping in the prevention of soil erosion and the absorption of water; providing nesting areas for birds and other wildlife; reducing the effects of sun, cold and wind, and filtering the air of pollutants. 
C.  The preservation of trees within the village is necessary in order to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare; to promote the foregoing, it is necessary to guide, regulate, and control any development or construction activity which disturbs or disrupts trees or vegetative cover in the village. 
D.  In order to promote the health, safety, welfare and preserve the type and quality of life enjoyed by the residents of this village, it is necessary and desirable to enact an ordinance preserving trees within the village.

(Ord. 98-0-05 § 2; prior code § 16.02) 
12.16.030 - Tree preservation standards. 
    The objective of this chapter is to control tree removal caused by any construction activity in the village. Measures taken to protect trees shall assure that existing trees shall be saved to the greatest extent possible. However, it is not the purpose of this chapter to prohibit development within allowed building setback; rather, the intent is to minimize tree loss through careful planning and tree replacement where necessary. The following standards shall apply to all development or construction activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under the subdivision control ordinance and zoning ordinance and building department permit process. 
A.  Development Proposals. 
1.  A tree survey shall be submitted with the sketch plan or other initial submittal related to development or redevelopment of a parcel and it shall be reviewed and verified by the tree expert. Said survey shall include a site plan indicating the location, size, common name, and condition of all trees located on the parcel with a DBH of twelve (12) inches or greater, and shall delineate all mature woodlands and woodlands. The tree survey will also outline the proposed structures and impervious areas and identify those trees which are proposed to be removed. The developer shall demonstrate through the tree survey, the proposed development design, and other information, that the proposed development minimizes tree loss to the greatest extent feasible and practical. Further, the developer shall demonstrate that the proposed lot configuration minimizes tree loss to the greatest extent feasible and possible by placing the maximum amount of trees feasible in the nonbuildable areas of proposed lots. 
2.  In areas considered woodlands under Section 12.16.020, no more than thirty (30) percent of the mature trees shall be cleared for development and the remaining seventy (70) percent shall be designated for preservation. Tree removal for required public improvements shall not constitute clearing of trees and shall not be included in calculating the thirty (30) percent of trees allowed to be removed. However, the developer shall demonstrate through the tree survey and other information that the proposed location of required public improvements minimizes tree loss to the greatest extent feasible and practical. Trees that the village determines are detrimental to the area shall not be counted in determining the removal percentage. 
3.  In areas considered woodlands under Section 12.16.020, the village board may specifically authorize more than thirty (30) percent removal as part of the final plat approval where particular hardship or impracticality is clearly demonstrated. Trees that the village determines are detrimental to the area shall not be counted in determining the removal percentage. 
4.  All final plats of subdivision or of planned unit developments approved by the village board shall include the location and size of all mature trees that will remain after development is completed. All included mature trees shall be designated for preservation. 
B.  Tree Preservation. The following shall apply to all buildable lots in the village: 
1.  All applications for building construction shall include a tree survey which identifies the size, location, and health of all significant trees and all mature trees on the parcel. 
2.  Tree preservation areas (as defined in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section) shall be established for all new residences on subdivided lots where one or more mature or significant trees exist at the time of application for a building permit. 
a.  The tree preservation area is that area of a lot which is not needed for the house and driveway construction and where all mature trees and significant trees shall be preserved. The building activity area shall be the area on the lot where building activity may take place and shall be as small as possible, including the entire area affected by building and grading activities related to the approved construction. No construction activity, movement and placement of equipment or material storage shall be permitted outside the building activity area, in the tree preservation area. All buildings and driveways shall be located to minimize tree damage and/or removal but consistent with minimum building setback requirements of the zoning ordinance. The building activity area shall be temporarily fenced by the developer during all construction so that all trees in the tree preservation area shall be preserved. 
b.  The building commissioner shall prescribe and publish procedures to be implemented by building permit applicants in order to ensure that mature trees and significant trees required to be preserved under the terms of this chapter are not damaged or destroyed as a result of construction. Any person finding such procedure to be unreasonable or overly burdensome may appeal the enforcement of such procedure to the zoning board of appeals which such board may confirm such procedure, modify such procedure or establish such other procedure as the zoning board of appeals shall determine. 
3.  The building department shall verify the preservation of all mature trees and significant trees in the tree preservation area prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Trees removed or destroyed in the tree preservation area shall be replaced in accordance with Section 12.16.040. 
4.  Any entity intending to perform underground utility construction that may involve removal of trees or work within drip lines of trees must first provide the village with a tree survey of the work area designating all woodlands, mature woodlands, mature trees or significant trees. The survey must also show drip lines of trees. After review of the survey, the village can issue a removal permit if the tree is dead or diseased, or the entity has no other option but to construct in the area. Open trenching shall be prohibited within the drip lines of trees unless it can be demonstrated that there is no other alternative location of utilities or method of installation. 
5.  If the entity does remove woodlands, mature woodlands, mature trees or significant trees or parts thereof, all options for replacement or relocation of the tree(s) must be considered. 
C.  Replacement Trees. Replacement trees shall not include the following: 
1.  Soft maple; 
2.  Poplar;

7.  Mountain ash; 
8.  Mulberry; 
9.  Ash trees; 
10.  As determined by the village board upon recommendation of the building department.

1.  Necessary to alleviate a safety hazard to pedestrian or vehicle traffic or which threatens public safety; 
2.  Necessary to remove a tree which poses a safety hazard to structures or utilities; 
3.  Necessary to remove a diseased tree or one which has been weakened by age, storm, fire, or other injury; 
4.  Necessary to observe good forestry practice such as the number of healthy trees a given parcel shall support; 
5.  The tree(s) to be removed is included on the list in subsection C of this section; provided, however, that any such tree that has a DBH greater than twelve (12) inches is replaced with an acceptable replacement having minimum caliper of two and one-half inches. 
E.  Violation-Penalty. Any person removing or destroying any woodland, mature woodland or significant tree required to be preserved under the terms of this chapter, or any person removing or destroying any mature tree(s) or significant tree(s) prior to the approval of a building permit application and for the purpose of avoiding the preservation of mature tree(s) or significant tree(s) herein shall be subject to a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per mature tree or significant tree removed or destroyed. A stop work order may be placed on the site if, in the opinion of the building department, it is necessary. In addition, each mature tree or significant tree so destroyed or removed, shall be replaced with a new tree of at least five inches in caliper measured one foot from the ground. The total sum of the calipers of replacement trees must be equal to the total sum of the calipers of the trees being removed. In the event of a fraction of an inch, if a fraction is less than one-half inch or greater, the higher full number shall be used. (Ord. 2006-0-30 § 2(A); Ord. 98-0-05 §§ 3-5; prior code § 16.03)

Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the village. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(Prior code § 9.10) 
13.12.140 - Tests and measurements. 
A.  The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measure-ments and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the village. At such times as deemed necessary, the village reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service. 
B.

A.  Basis for Wastewater Service Charges. 
1.  The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and a surcharge, if applicable. 
2.  The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding bonds by the number of users. Through further divisions, the monthly and quarterly debt service charges can be computed. 
3.  The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal concentrations: 
a.  A five-day, twenty (20) degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of three hundred (300) mg/l. 
b.  A suspended solids (SS) content of four hundred (400) mg/l. 
4.  It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows: 
a.  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all works categories. 
b.  Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage strength. 
5.  All users whose waters exceed the normal concentrations for BOD (three hundred (300) mg/l) and SS (four hundred (400) mg/l) will be required to install, operate and maintain pretreatment facilities so that concentrations do not exceed BOD (three hundred (300) mg/l) and SS (nine hundred (900) mg/l). 
6.  The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the village in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs. 
B.  Measurement of Flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of 1,000/(Y) gallons. 
1.  If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
2.  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. 
3.  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed unless service is cancelled, without the consent of the village.

(Ord. 2008-0-06 § 5) 
13.24.060 - Ultimate responsibility. 
    The standards set forth in this chapter and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not intend, nor imply, that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination or pollution of stormwater or unauthorized discharge of pollutants to the stormwater drainage system or to waters of the United States. 
(Ord. 2008-0-06 § 6) 
13.24.070 - Discharge prohibitions.

No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the stormwater drainage system or waters or the United States any materials, pollutants, or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards. 
    The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
1.  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this chapter: water line flushing, fire hydrant flushing, discharges from potable water sources, landscape irrigation, lawn watering, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, diverted stream flows, natural riparian habitat and wetland flows, springs, storm sewer cleaning water, street wash water from streets where spills or leaks of pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials has not occurred (unless the pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials have been removed), foundation drains, footing drains, crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, noncommercial vehicle washing, routing external building washing that does not use detergents, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges (discharges must contain less than one part per million chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials. 
2.  Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
3.  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. 
4.  The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and all other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted by the authorized enforcement agency for the discharge to the stormwater drainage system. 
B.  Prohibition of Illicit Connections. The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage or any other nonstormwater discharge to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. 2008-0-06 § 7) 
13.24.080 - Suspension of MS4 access. 
A.  Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations.

If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States and to minimize danger to persons. 
B.  Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator, in writing, of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. 
C.  A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the authorized enforcement agency.

C.  The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises' stormwater discharge. 
D.  The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the premises to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
F.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a premises is a violation of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation of this chapter if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
G.  If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

3.  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law. 
B.  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village.

Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase. 
D.  Withdrawals. The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
1.  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
2.  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
3.  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or

E.  Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section. 
F.  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C of this section. 
G.  Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
H.  Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-0-22, § 2, adopted June 20, 2017, changed the title of ch. 15.48 from "building facade architectural design standards" to "Industrial and office design standards." 

15.48.010 - Industrial and office design standards. 
    The following standards are intended to provide supplemental detail to established village comprehensive plan, architectural guidelines, zoning ordinances and building codes relative to facade renovation and new building facade harmony/compatibility requirements for industrial and business zones. They are adopted as a supplement to those existing. 
    These standards are subdivided into nine (9) parts designed to address major elements of building facades: 
A.  General facade design concepts; 
B.  Exterior building materials; 
C.  Exterior material colors; 
D.  Building features and details; 
E.  Attached structures and appentices; 
F.  Fenestration-Windows and glazing; 
G.  Sign compatibility; 
H.  Building lighting; 
I.  Building system screening; 
J.  Building/site screening; 
    The following standards are appropriate for all office and industrial buildings and developments, large industrial zones, individual sites as well as related upper story residential and office development. Standards apply to new development additions, remodeling, infill and upgrade type construction. Standards are intended to assist in creating viable and attractive properties, establishing architecturally harmonious environments. Design goals include improving: 
1.  Pedestrian and vehicular streetscapes; 
2.  Visibility of business activities; 
3.  Harmonious design of major business industrial developments throughout the village; 
4.  Landscape screening and buffering. 
A.  General Facade Design Concepts. 
1.  The incorporation of consistent architectural style is required on all facades of a building. The architectural style chosen shall be consistent with the highest quality styles of architecture found throughout the village. 
2.  Small developments (Five (5) buildings or less). Consistent architectural theme shall be required throughout each commercial/office development. 
3.  Large developments (more than five (5) buildings). A consistent architectural theme shall be required throughout each street, cluster, grouping or complex of buildings. 
4.  Architectural features and treatments shall be consistent with the architectural style chosen on the street side, but with a significant continuation of materials, colors, detail and trim on the remaining sides and rear facades. The level of intensity of features and treatments shall be a minimum of forty (40) percent on the sides and rear facades and shall be consistent with the architectural style chosen. 
5.  Continuity of architectural features and treatments throughout building facades and throughout a development shall be required. 
6.  Continuity of horizontal architectural elements, between components of a building on all facades, shall be required. 
7.  Building vertical elements shall be consistent throughout all building facades compatible with adjacent buildings. 
8.  Building presence, from the street, shall be given priority as an important component of facade design. 
9.  Distinction between the upper floors and first floor facades shall be required on all facades of office type buildings, if consistent with the architectural style chosen. 
10.  Rhythm of ground floor architectural features shall harmonize with rhythm of upper stories. 
11.  Maintenance of consistency in building widths, in an architectural block of buildings, or development, shall be required. 
12.  Individual building units shall be clearly defined through use of such elements as pillars, piers, material changes, separation of glass, and/or awnings, for office building and office components of industrial buildings, consistent with the architectural style chosen. 
13.  Architectural features and applied moldings help to break up the monotony resulting from uninterrupted walls. This type of treatment on plain walls shall be required on all facades consistent with the architectural style chosen. 
14.  Consider the directional expression of adjacent buildings. Building design may give a predominantly vertical, horizontal or non-directional expression to a building facade. The directional expression of buildings shall complement that of adjacent buildings. 
15.  Building facade heights shall vary with each component of a building. For example, office component wall heights shall vary from that of the warehouse. 
16.  Long, uninterrupted wall or roof planes shall be avoided, unless consistent with the architectural style chosen. 
17.  Offsets, within the form of buildings, are encouraged as features that minimize the bulky look of a block-shaped building. 
18.  Building windows shall be relatively consistent in height and design and consistent with front facade doors to create a cohesive appearance for each building. Building window base heights shall be consistent with adjacent facades within, and adjacent to, a development. 
19.  Horizontal building detailing including, but not limited to, sills, headers, transoms, cornices, signage bands, shall be consistent in design, coordinated and compatible with one another. 
20.  Articulated roof-edges, clearly defined with significant detail and with reinforced horizontal lines are a required facade element. 
21.  Overpowering architectural features should only be used when they reflect the appropriate and accurate architectural style of the project and as long as the materials, construction and the design enhance the overall building structure. This type of feature is not allowed if inappropriate or out of scale. 
22.  Monotony should be avoided in facade design. The roofline at the top of a structure shall incorporate offsets, jogs, and/or architectural features and components for enhanced interest. 
23.  Standing seam and batten seam metal roof systems, as principal roof/wall elements, are limited to accents. 
24.  Primary entrances shall be located at the front of the building, unless off-street parking dictates otherwise, and should be recessed or have prominent architectural features. 
25.  Locate the major facade and/or major entrance of a building on the side facing the primary pedestrian or vehicular access, unless dictated by off-street parking. 
26.  Principle entryways shall be enhanced by features outlined in subsection E. 
27.  One principle entry for each building component is encouraged. If location of parking creates the need, multiple entries may be included. Item 33 shall apply to all entries. 
28.  Doors, especially principal entryways, shall be emphasized using awnings, canopies, pediments, or other appropriate design feature. 
29.  Multi-tenant industrial buildings shall include variation in architectural components, details and finishes in order to break up monotony and prevent repetitiveness. 
30.  In multi-tenant office buildings, one principle building entrance is encouraged over multiple entrances. If the site and/or parking configuration create a need, multiple entries may be included but should be clustered. 
31.  Buildings should be designed with foundations below grade. If any foundation appears more than twelve (12) inches above grade it should be finished concrete, or veneered in an appropriate finish, consistent with other facade finishes. 
32.  All pre-cast wall or screen panels shall have pattern surface features and shall be pre-finished or stained or painted. Poured in place concrete shall have patterns and detailed surface features and shall be stained or painted. Panels with faux finish (i.e. brick/stone) are strongly encouraged. 
33.  Building Scale and Mass. The relative proportion of a building is its neighboring existing buildings, to pedestrians and to other buildings in the area shall be maintained for each new building in a development. 
34.  Building Rooflines and Roof Shapes. The visual continuity of roofs and their contributing elements (i.e., parapet walls, coping, cornices, etc.) shall be maintained in a building development on all facades. 
35.  Design Repetition. Matching building facade designs may not be repeated within four (4) lots of each other in any given subdivision, individual sites or a subdivision. 
36.  Elevations of Buildings Facing Public Streets and Public Areas. Buildings facing public streets and public areas shall include major front elevation design elements on those elevations facing public streets or public areas, in order to enhance pedestrian and vehicular streetscapes (see subsections D. and E.) 
37.  Single large building facade masses shall be avoided. Facades shall be visually divided, by architectural features, into areas of seven hundred fifty (750) square feet or less. 
38.  Facade wall components larger than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet shall incorporate fascia's, canopies, arcades, building offsets column features, banding reveals or other multidimensional design features to break up single large elements. 
39.  For business/office development, and office components of industrial developments the first floor shall retain a largely transparent character, while the upper story(s) shall have a more solid quality to facade fenestration, consistent with the design style chosen (see subsection F). 
40.  Transparent facade design (sixty (60) percent minimum-Business/office) is required to increase visibility of business activity from the sidewalk and street at business site locations, unless the building function dictates otherwise (see subsection F. fenestration for more detail). 
41.  The scale, proportions, massing, articulation and design features of the front facade of business/office buildings shall enhance the pedestrian and vehicular experience, emphasizing the human scale. 
42.  Facade components that incorporate such traditional design elements as cornices, transoms, friezes, bulkheads, window bases, and window head moldings are appropriate and required for office building, consistent with the architectural style chosen. 
43.  Facades and roofing that can be seen by the public shall be of long life, easily maintained, natural materials, in office/industrial developments.

Chapter 16.24 - DESIGN STANDARDS 
Sections: 

16.24.010 - Design standards-Conformance required. 
    The subdivision of land including the arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets, alleys, cross-walks, easements, sites for parks, playgrounds, and schools or other land to be dedicated for public use shall conform to the comprehensive plan and official map of the village. Approval of the design of a proposed subdivision shall be considered on the basis of its relation to existing and platted streets, reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjacent land, topographic conditions, runoff of stormwater, public convenience and safety, and appropriate relation to the proposed land uses of the areas to be served. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.24.020 - General standards. 
A.  Size and Shape. 
1.  The size and shape of the land to be subdivided shall be sufficient and proper for land planning purposes, suitable in area and dimensions for the uses intended. 
2.  The plans for the subdivision of the property shall incorporate into and be compatible with the existing and potential uses on outlots bracketed by the area to be subdivided. 
B.  Desirable Environment. The layout of the streets, lots, blocks, buildings, parking lots and public lands shall create a desirable environment for the people who shall use the proposed uses, without exercising a detrimental influence or effect upon surrounding land uses. 
C.  Design Compatible with Natural Features. 
1.  The design of every subdivision shall be compatible with the existing topography, drainage patterns, and other natural features on the site. 
2.  Every subdivision shall conserve isolated mature trees, wooded areas, water courses, scenic views, ponds, floodplain areas, historical landmarks, and other features of the property, which, if preserved, would add to the attractiveness and value of the subdivision, neighborhood, or the village as a whole. 
3.  The design of the subdivision should, wherever possible, lower all maintenance costs through a self maintainable ecological system, to conserve materials, construction labor, construction equipment, land, and environmental values; to balance construction costs, amortization costs, operating costs, maintenance costs, and replacement costs, thereby minimizing total average annual costs; to encourage the construction and installation of energy efficient systems. 
4.  The design of every subdivision shall, wherever possible, create and integrate water features throughout residential land use areas. 
5.  The design of every subdivision shall make adequate provision for the use and maintenance of open space. 
6.  The design of every subdivision shall provide adequate acoustical and visual privacy for incompatible adjacent uses. 
D.  Subdivision Name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The plan commission/zoning board of appeals shall designate the name of the subdivision with the approval of the preliminary plat. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.24.030 - Lots, blocks, buildings and parking areas. 
A.  Lots. 
1.  Political Boundaries. Lots shall be laid out so that they do not cross any political boundary, especially any school district boundary or the boundaries of the village. 
2.  Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning ordinance and building code of the village and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved and dedicated street. 
3.  Lot Dimensions. 
a.  Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance of the village. 
b.  Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the plan commission/zoning board of appeals may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning ordinance of the village and with these regulations. 
c.  In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule shall give a better street or lot plan. 
d.  Building setback lines shall conform to the front yard requirements of the zoning ordinance of the village, with corner lots observing the minimum front yard requirements from both streets. 
e.  The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance of the village. 
f.  A minimum side yard of ten feet shall be provided for all lots with a side lot adjoining a pedestrian way. 
g.  Residential lots abutting an expressway, major street, railroad right-of-way, or other inharmonious use shall have a width or depth of twenty (20) feet, adjacent to such expressway, major street, railroad right-of-way, or other inharmonious use in excess of the width or depth required by the zoning ordinance of the village for that district. A landscape easement shall be required on such lots across said twenty (20) foot strip of land and shall be designated on the final plat as follows: "This strip is reserved for landscape screening. The placement of structures hereon or vehicular access hereacross is prohibited." 
h.  Lots abutting a water course, drainageway, channel, or stream shall have a minimum width or depth required to provide adequate building site and the minimum usable area for front, side, and rear yards, as required in the zoning ordinance of the village, with the building foundation two feet above the flood level as measured from the maximum high water line. 
i.  For lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, lot lines should be placed in the center line thereof. 
4.  Access. 
a.  All lots shall abut a publicly dedicated street. 
b.  Double frontage and reserve frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major streets or highways or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
c.  Driveway access onto a major street from any abutting residential lot shall be prohibited by deed restriction, as recorded on the final plat. Driveway access onto a major street from any abutting non-residential lot shall be prohibited by deed restriction, as recorded on the final plat, except as permitted via a central access driveway, provided that: 
1)  All lots to use such a driveway shall have access easements at least twenty-five (25) feet wide recorded along the frontage of such lots. 
2)  There is no discontinuous change in elevation at the boundary line of any of the lots along such access easement, with the village engineer approving the grading elevations along the access easement. 
3)  The plan commission/zoning board of appeals shall recommend and the village board of trustees shall require additional area for turning radii, curb cuts, deceleration lanes, and snow deposit, if such are needed. 
5.  Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentrations of storm drainage waters onto adjacent lots. All drainage courses shall be protected by covenants and deed restrictions, preventing alteration, building upon, or obstructing of the drainage ways. 
6.  Driveway Location. 
a.  Driveways shall be located so that there is adequate sight clear distance onto the abutting road, avoiding locations along the inside curve or below the crown of a hilltop on collector and major streets. 
b.  The center line of any driveway shall be offset a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from the right-of-way line of a major street and twenty-five (25) feet from all other rights-of-way. 
c.  All driveway locations shall be in conformance with the village's road access ordinance. 
B.  Blocks. 
1.  Design. 
a.  The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following:

2)  Zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions. 
3)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of the street traffic. 
b.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, watercourses, or the other property lines of the subdivision. 
c.  No block shall exceed one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet in length except where required by unusual topographic conditions, nor shall they be less than four hundred (400) feet in length. The lengths of blocks in non-residential subdivisions shall be approved by the village. 
2.  Easements in Blocks. Easements no less than ten feet wide through blocks shall be required to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic. 
C.  Buildings. 
1.  Conformance with Existing Ordinances. All buildings should be located on lots in conformance with the zoning ordinance, building code, and other rules and regulations of the village. 
2.  Residential Buildings. The following design criteria should be incorporated into the preliminary plat and all other site plans for residential buildings: 
a.  Residents in their dwelling units should have as little disturbance as possible from passing motor vehicles. 
b.  All dwelling units should be within reasonable proximity to open space areas. 
c.  Each dwelling unit should have direct access to the pedestrian walkway and bikeway system. 
d.  Residential buildings should be positioned to take best advantage of the summer winds and winter sun and to minimize summer solar heat and the prevailing winter winds. 
e.  Placement of the garages should not be visually disruptive, yet be within close proximity to each dwelling unit for which they are intended. 
f.  Reasonable visual and acoustical privacy should be provided for the residents in each dwelling unit, especially at entrances, patios, and balconies, with no unrestricted views into any principal room by the occupancy of another building. 
g.  The location of the proposed buildings and structures should not have a significant adverse impact on adjacent land uses. 
h.  Paved access should be available for fire, ambulance and police vehicles to within one hundred (100) feet of the principal entrances of buildings. Closer access, for infrequent use, may be across unpaved areas. 
i.  Street lights, postal boxes, street identification signs, and other such street fixtures should be compatible in design with the architectural intent of the nearby buildings. 
j.  Garbage containers and utility pads should be screened from view. 
k.  Anti-Monotony Standards.

2)  The same exterior color package may not be constructed next to or directly across from itself. 
3)  The same model/facade combination may be constructed twice around the bulb of a cul-de-sac if the facades are distinctly different, however, the same model/facade combination may not be constructed immediately next to each other. In the event the same model/facade combination is constructed around the bulb of a cul-de-sac, distinctly different color packages must be used. 
D.  Parking for Multi-Family Residential Buildings. 
1.  The number of parking spaces shall be provided in the subdivision in conformance with the requirements of the Grayslake Zoning Ordinance. 
2.  Dwelling unit entrances should be related to parking locations to assure convenient and safe access for residents and guests. 
3.  No exposed parking area containing more than two parking spaces should be within eight feet of any principal residential building. 
4.  Large parking areas should contain maintainable planting strips, bays, berms, and islands to provide visual screening, but not to obstruct adequate sight clear distance. 
5.  Storage areas for recreational vehicles should be provided. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.24.040 - Pedestrian circulation system. 
    Subdivisions shall provide a pedestrian circulation system in their design to connect individual dwelling units with parking and garbage disposal areas, to connect neighboring dwelling units, and to connect groups of dwelling units with schools, parks, commercial facilities, and other community facilities. 
A.  Criteria for Type of Pedestrian Circulation System. 
1.  The plan commission/zoning board of appeals shall recommend and the village board of trustees shall approve the type of pedestrian circulation system appropriate for the subdivision and for the Village, which may require the physical separation of the pedestrian circulation system from the vehicular circulation system, depending upon: 
a.  The size of the subdivision. 
b.  The pathway system, if any, used on adjacent property. 
c.  The topography of the property. 
d.  The official map of the village. 
e.  The presence of any "linear" physical features on the site, such as utility rights-of-way, and other similar features. 
f.  The amount of unsubdivided property adjacent to the subject site. 
g.  The location of the schools, parks, and community focal points. 
2.  If the pedestrian circulation system is physically separated from the vehicular circulation system, the plan commission/zoning board of appeals may recommend and the village board of trustees may approve a reduction in the right-of-way width of minor streets. 
B.  Design Layout. 
1.  The layout of the system should have a reasonable relationship to foreseeable movement desires, connecting residential areas with schools, area-wide parks, commercial facilities, work areas, existing or potential public transportation points, and other community facilities in a convenient and logical fashion. 
2.  The circulation system should improve or assure public access at locations offering unusual overlooks or other particularly interesting physical features. 
3.  Extensions into adjoining property should be provided. 
4.  Conflict points with vehicular traffic should be minimized, and should be located only where there is adequate sight distance, and grade separated and/or improved with appropriate safety devices, if necessary. 
5.  The circulation system should be selected to have minimum practical change in grade throughout their length, and should follow the natural slope of the land. 
6.  The circulation system should provide for rest areas. 
7.  The pedestrian circulation system should be constructed in conformance with Village engineering standards in effect from time to time. 
C.  Location. The circulation system shall be located within public rights-of-way, public easements, or common areas, maintained by a homeowners' association, parks, or school sites. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.24.050 - Streets. 
A.  General Standards. 
1.  The subdivision shall have adequate off-site access to it, in sufficient capacity to handle all traffic which can be reasonably expected to be generated for the land uses to be located in the subdivision. 
2.  All streets in the subdivision shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street system as established on the official map and comprehensive plan of the village. 
3.  Major elements of the street system should be used to help define and buffer different land use areas, enhancing their identity and cohesiveness. 
4.  To the extent feasible, the lineal length of streets, the number of street intersections, and the paved area within intersections should be minimized. 
B.  Types and Specifications. 
1.  Types. The functional definitions of the street classification system for the village are: 
a.  Major Street. A major street is a highway artery intended to carry a large volume of high-speed traffic to interchanges with interstate highways or to locations outside of the village limits. Such streets are not intended to provide access to any abutting property. Intersections with such streets shall be very limited. 
b.  Collector Street. This street functions to conduct traffic between major streets, residential neighborhoods, work areas, commercial concentrations and/or important activity centers. It is intended to bring traffic from minor streets and cul-de-sacs to major streets. This type of road is not intended to provide access to abutting single-family lots but can provide access via controlled access driveways to abutting multiple-family projects, industrial plants and commercial property. Such roads should extend from one major street to another major street. 
c.  Subcollector Street. This street links cul-de-sacs and minor streets of higher classifications. It is the principal street to bring traffic through a residential subdivision or a unified industrial, commercial or office project. Access to abutting property can be permitted, but is not encouraged. Such streets should extend from a major or collector street to another major or collector street. 
d.  Minor Street. This street is the primary means of access to property. In residential areas minor streets should intersect with subcollector streets or collector streets, not with other minor streets and cul-de-sacs, and not with major streets. 
e.  Cul-de-Sac. This is a short street ending in a turnaround design and intended as a permanent terminus. Such streets should be used to discourage through traffic and to increase privacy. Cul-de-sacs should intersect with subcollector and collector streets, not with minor streets and other cul-de-sacs, and not with major streets. Cul-de-sacs in residential areas should be no longer than five hundred (500) feet unless otherwise approved by the village board. Landscaped islands will be allowed in the "bulb" of the cul-de-sac with village board approval. Landscaping must be approved by the village board. The diameter of these landscaped islands shall be no more than forty (40) feet and no utility structures will be allowed in the islands. 
"Clear zones" will be constructed in conformance with village standards in effect from time to time. 
f.  Private Streets are Prohibited. 
2.  Specifications. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and to avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for streets are hereby required.

9.  The radius of curb returns at intersections in business areas may be reduced to thirty-five (35) feet, as recommended by the village engineer. Under unusual topographic or site conditions, a longer radius may be required. 
10.  Street rights-of-way in multi-family residential subdivisions shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet. 
C.  Design Layout. 
1.  General Concepts. 
a.  All streets shall be laid out in conformance with the official map and the comprehensive plan of the village. Where such is not shown on the official map and comprehensive plan, the arrangement of streets within a subdivision shall either: 
1)  Provide for the continuation or protection of existing major and collector streets in adjacent areas; or 
2)  Conform to a plan for the area or neighborhood recommended by the plan commission/zoning board of appeals and approved by the village board to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance of existing streets or conformance with the official map or comprehensive plan impracticable. 
b.  All streets shall be located relative to existing topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to efficient drainage and utility systems. 
c.  All streets shall be properly located relative to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
2.  Residential Streets. 
a.  A residential area should be conveniently accessible from major streets. 
b.  Residential streets shall provide safe and convenient access to housing. 
c.  Minor streets shall be laid out as to discourage high speed or through traffic, but the design shall be logical and comprehensible to a motorist or a pedestrian attempting to travel to and through the subdivision. 
d.  Curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be used where such will result in a more desirable layout, or will avoid monotony of lot appearance. 
e.  Layouts of residential areas should be planned so that no future need to widen any minor street or subcollector street will arise. 
f.  Minor streets and cul-de-sacs should intersect only with subcollector and collector streets, unless the physical features of the site do not allow for such a design. 
3.  Non-Residential Streets. 
a.  Streets carrying non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended through adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
b.  The streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
c.  Streets extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way should: 
1)  Be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites, and 
2)  Be at a distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-way, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, or be at such other distance as shall be necessary, when intersecting a street which will be grade separated when crossing the railroad. 
3)  No signal shall be within two hundred fifty (250) feet of a railroad crossing. 
4.  Half Streets. Half streets shall not be permitted except to complete an existing half street which is dedicated and accepted, or to conform to the official map and comprehensive plan of the village. 
5.  Other Design Criteria. 
a.  Streets jogs with center line offsets of less than three hundred (300) feet shall be avoided. 
b.  Tangents shall be used between reverse curves on all major streets and collector streets. 
c.  Vertical alignment of streets should assure that inclines generally can be negotiated during adverse weather conditions and sight distances are adequate for safety. 
d.  Extensions of roads shall be provided into all adjacent property as needed. When no such extensions are provided, the extensions of appropriate easements to the boundary of the subdivision for pedestrian traffic, drainage facilities and utility lines shall be required. 
e.  The terminal of a cul-de-sac should not be lower than the neck of the cul-de-sac. 
f.  Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the official map or comprehensive plan indicates that a road should be realigned or widened which would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, such land shall be reserved and dedicated. 
D.  Access. 
1.  [Access Generally.] All lots shall have access onto a dedicated street. 
a.  Residential areas of twelve (12) dwelling units to the acre or less should have driveway access onto only cul-de-sacs, minor streets, and subcollector streets. 
b.  Residential areas of more than twelve 912) dwelling units to the acre should have driveway access onto only subcollector and collector streets. 
c.  Industrial, commercial, governmental, or other non-residential lots should have driveway access onto minor, subcollector, or collector streets. 
2.  Access to Major Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed major street, access to such major street shall be limited to one of the following: 
a.  The lots shall be so laid out that they back onto the major street and shall front onto a street of lower classification, provided that no access shall be allowed onto the major street from the abutting lots, as recorded on the final plat, and provided further that a landscape strip at least thirty (30) feet wide shall be provided along the lot line abutting the major street. 
b.  A marginal access or frontage road shall be laid out parallel to the major street, with access of abutting lots onto such marginal access or frontage road, provided that such marginal access or frontage road shall be separated from the major street by a planting or grass strip, and provided further that the village board shall approve all connection points of the frontage road with major street. 
c.  A central access driveway shall: 
1)  Be allowed only as specifically approved by the village board of trustees, upon recommendation of the plan commission/zoning board of appeals. 
2)  Be no closer than four hundred (400) feet to any street or any other central access driveway on the same side of a major street. 
3)  Align with any street or central access driveway on the opposite side of the major street, or be offset therefrom by a minimum of two hundred (200) feet. 
4)  Have access easements recorded along the frontage of the lots to use same. 
E.  Alleys. 
1.  Alleys in residential areas shall not be permitted. 
2.  In commercial, business, or industrial districts, definite and assured provisions shall be made for service access such as for off-street loading, unloading, and parking, consistent and adequate for the uses proposed. If, in the opinion of the village, such facilities are inadequate, the village may permit or require the dedication and improvement of a public alley, subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Alley intersection and sharp changes in alley alignment shall be avoided. 
b.  The minimum width of any alley shall be twenty-four (24) feet. 
c.  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as recommended by the plan commission/zoning board of appeals and approved by the village board of trustees. 
F.  Intersections. 
1.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, but in no case shall any intersection be less than seventy-five degrees (75°). An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. 
2.  Intersections on the inside of a curve, on a hilltop, or at a point slightly below a hilltop shall be avoided. 
3.  An intersection of more than two streets shall not be permitted. 
4.  Residential minor streets and cul-de-sacs should intersect only with subcollector and collector streets, not with other residential minor streets and cul-de-sacs, and not with major streets. 
5.  Centerlines of streets at intersections should align or be offset therefrom by a minimum of three hundred (300) feet. 
6.  In non-residential areas and along major streets, proposed new intersections shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any intersections on the opposite side of such street. Residential street layouts should be planned to avoid four-way intersections. 
7.  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the subdivider shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance. 
8.  The cross slopes on street and intersection rights-of-way shall be three percent or less. 
9.  Intersections along major streets shall be at least three hundred (300) feet apart. 
G.  Other Requirements. 
1.  Reserve Strips. Reserve ("spite" or "devil") strips controlling access to streets shall not be permitted. Streets roughly parallel to the boundary line of the subdivision shall be located either on that boundary line or not less than one lot depth from said boundary line. All streets intended to provide the subdivision and adjacent parcels of property with means of ingress and egress shall extend to the boundary line of the subdivision. 
2.  Road Names. The plan commission/zoning board of appeals shall review and the village board of trustees shall approve all street names, consulting with the postmaster and the chief of the fire department. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the village so as not to cause confusion. A street which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.24.060 - Easements. 
A.  Utility Easements. Easements for utility services shall be provided, totaling not less than ten feet in width, or greater as required by the utility companies, the village, or the state, centered along the rear of each lot and along side lot lines where necessary, to provide for proper continuity of utility lines from lot to lot and from block to block. 
B.  Drainage Easements. Established lakes, streams, and channels shall be protected by drainage easements. The location, width, alignment and improvement of these easements shall be approved by the village board of trustees, but in no case shall the easements be less than twenty (20) feet wide on each side of the water course at the high water mark. The easements shall permit necessary public channel maintenance and improvement work and access for equipment thereon. Easements shall appear on the Final Plat. 
C.  Conservation Easements. Conservation easements shall be established in new subdivisions along regional and community arterial roads and community collector roads as defined in the comprehensive plan of the village. Said easements must appear on the final plat, be a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width, and activities in the easements be limited to landscaping and maintenance. If no landscaping exists in or along said easement, a landscaping plan shall be submitted for village board approval. These easements shall be exclusive of rear yard requirements. 
D.  Other Requirements. 
1.  No building or other permanent structure shall be constructed on any easement. 
2.  Extensions of utility easements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision may be required to provide continuity of the utilities to adjoining property. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.24.070 - Drainage ways. 
A.  Streams and Channels. Sharply meandering streams may be partly straightened and minor changes made in other channels subject to State Statute provided that: 
1.  The floodway dimensions of the stream or channel are maintained. 
2.  The volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway is not reduced. 
3.  No adverse impacts are created downstream. 
B.  Lesser Channels. Lesser floodwater runoff channels on a parcel shall be maintained. They may be centered on the rear lot lines in a block or entirely within the rear yards of a single row of lots, provided in either case the lot depth is sufficient to provide a slope of not less than six horizontal to one vertical along the stormwater flow and to provide a building site above established flood-protection elevation on the lot.

16.24.080 - Traditional neighborhood development. 
A.  Intent. The purpose of this section is to allow for development of fully integrated, mixed use pedestrian oriented neighborhoods. The intent is to minimize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, infrastructure cost and environmental degradation. Its provision adapted urban conventions, which were normally in the United States and the Village of Grayslake (village) until the 1940s and historically were based on the following design principles: 
a)  Neighborhoods have identifiable centers and edges. 
b)  Edge lots are readily accessible to retail and recreation by non-vehicular means (a distance not greater than one half mile). 
c)  Use and housing types are mixed and in close proximity to one another. 
d)  Street networks are interconnected and blocks are small. 
B.  Applicability. 
1)  The traditional neighborhood development (TND) section is an alternative set of standards for land in the village that has a property line within two thousand (2,000) linear feet of a commuter rail station. 
2)  All TND developments shall follow the preliminary and final plat or planned unit development procedures listed in the village subdivision control and/or zoning ordinances. 
3)  If there is a conflict between standard and design ordinances, the provisions of this title shall apply. 
C.  Definitions. The following definitions shall be observed and applied. 
    Boulevard: The portion of the street right-of-way between the back of curb line and sidewalk or property line. The right-of-way shall be a minimum of seven feet for all residential areas. 
    Gateway: A facility located at a gateway and that marks the entrance or transition through massing, extended height, use of arches or colonnades, or other distinguishing features. 
    Modified Grid Street Pattern: An interconnected system of streets that is primarily a rectilinear grid and pattern, however, modified in a street layout and block shape as to avoid a monotonous repetition of the basic street/block grid pattern. Street layouts for blocks are generally in the range of two [hundred] to four hundred (200 to 400) feet deep by four [hundred] to eight hundred (400 to 800) feet long. 
    Neighborhood Center: A street containing a mix of uses, including the planned small community's greatest concentration of commercial development. The neighborhood center together with the community park shall form the focus of the traditional neighborhood. 
    Parkway: A landscape median commonly located in the center of a public right-of-way. Parkways vary in width from four to fifteen (15) feet, depending on the street type and intensity of adjacent uses. 
    Traditional Neighborhood: A pedestrian-oriented neighborhood, with variable lot widths and sizes, a mix of dwelling unit types, and non-residential uses generally located along a neighborhood center or fronting on a community park. The predominant uses should be small lot single-family and multi-family. The commercial components should not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the designated area. 
D.  Traditional Neighborhood Development Design Standards. 
1)  Neighborhood Uses. In order to make a neighborhood walkable, it is important to mix land uses. Therefore a TND shall consist of three types of land uses: a mix of residential uses, a mixed-use area, and open space. These land uses types are provided below: 
(1)  A mix of residential uses of the following types can occur anywhere in the TND. 
For infill development, the mix of residential uses may be satisfied by existing residential uses within the TND. 
(i)  Single-family detached dwellings; minimum lot size-Four thousand (4,000) square feet; 
(ii)  Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes, twin homes, town homes, townhouses, row houses; 
(iii)  Multi-family dwelling, including senior housing. 
(2)  Mixed use area, of commercial, residential, and open space uses as some are identified below. Individual commercial businesses shall not exceed ten thousand (10,000) square feet in building size or occupy more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of a building. 
(a)  Commercial uses: 
(i)  Food services (such as neighborhood grocery stores; butcher shops; bakeries; restaurants, not including drive-through; cafes; coffee shops; neighborhood bars or pubs); 
(ii)  Retail uses (such as florists or nurseries; hardware stores; stationery stores; book stores; studios and shops of artists and artisans); 
(iii)  Services (such as day care centers; music, dance studios; offices, professional and medical; banks; barber; salon; dry cleaning); 
(iv)  Accommodations (such as bed and breakfast establishments, small hotels or inns). 
(b)  Residential uses: 
(i)  Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes, townhouses, row houses; 
(ii)  Multi-family dwellings, including senior housing;

(iv)  "Live/work" (home occupation) units that combine a residence and the resident's workplace. 
(c)  Open space uses: 
(i)  Central square; 
(ii)  Neighborhood park; 
(iii)  Playground. 
(3)  Open space uses identified below should be incorporated in the traditional neighborhood development as appropriate. 
(a)  Environmental and scenic corridors; 
(b)  Protect natural areas - conservancy parks; 
(c)  Community parks; 
(d)  Streams, ponds, and other water bodies; 
(e)  Stormwater detention/retention facilities. 
2)  Development Units. The number of residential dwelling units and the amount of nonresidential development (excluding open spaces) shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  Mixed residential uses: 
(1)  The number of single-family attached and detached units permitted shall be determined on a case by case basis with the optimum density being three to six dwelling units per net acre. 
(2)  The number of multi-family units shall be determined on a case by case basis with optimum density being six to and high nine to twelve (12) dwelling units per net acre. 
(b)  Mixed-use areas. 
(1)  The number of single-family and multi-family dwelling units permitted shall be calculated the same as above. 
(2)  All dwelling units constructed above commercial uses shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this section. However, the total number of dwelling units shall not be increased by more than ten percent, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Parkland. Parkland shall be dedicated in accordance with the requirements of the Grayslake Subdivision Control Ordinance or the planned unit development standards of the Grayslake Zoning Ordinance. 
(4)  Lot and Block Standards. 
(a)  Block and lot size diversity. Street layouts should provide for perimeter blocks that are generally in the range of two [hundred] to four hundred (200-400) feet deep by four [hundred to] eight hundred (400-800) feet long. A variety of lot sizes throughout the TND shall be provided to facilitate housing diversity and choice and meet the projected requirements of people with different housing needs. No block face shall have a length greater than five hundred (500) feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access. 
(b)  Lot widths. Lot widths should create a relatively symmetrical street cross section that reinforces the public space of the street as a simple, unified public space. 
(c)  Building setback, front-Mixed use area. Structures in mixed use areas have no minimum setback. Commercial and civic or institutional buildings should abut the sidewalks in mixed-use area. 
(d)  Building setback, front-Mixed residential uses. Single-family and multi-family residences shall have a building setback in the front between zero and twenty-five (25) feet. 
(e)  Building setback, rear-Mixed residential uses. The principal building on lots devoted to single-family detached residences shall be setback a minimum of six feet and no more than twenty-five (25) feet from the rear lot line. All other building shall be setback minimum of five feet.

(b)  Paving. Reduction of impervious surfaces through the use of interlocking pavers is strongly encouraged for areas such as remote parking lots and parking areas for periodic uses. 
(7)  Architectural Standards. Due to the mixed-use nature of the development, architectural compatibility is necessary in order to visually integrate development and allow for proximity of varied uses. The design style of the TND shall be conveyed with drawings or computer simulations of typical proposed building elevations (including dimensions of building height and width, and facade treatment). 
(a)  Guidelines for Existing Structures. Existing structures, if determined to be historic or architecturally significant, shall be protected from demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape development. The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties shall be used as the criteria for renovating historic or architecturally significant structures. 
(b)  Guidelines for New Structures. 
(1)  Entries and Facades. 
(i)  For commercial buildings the architectural features, materials, and the articulation of a building shall be continued on all sides visible from a public street. Building height of a commercial building shall be a maximum of four stories unless a special use permit is granted. 
(ii)  The front facade of the principal building on any lot in a TND shall face onto a public street. 
(iii)  The front facade shall not be oriented to face directly toward a parking lot. 
(iv)  Porches, pent roofs, roof overhangs, hooded front doors or other similar architectural elements shall define the front entrance to all residences. 
(v)  For commercial buildings, a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the front facade on the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting of window or door openings allowing views into and out of the interior. 
(vi)  Commercial structures on opposite sides of the same street should be of the same architectural character. This provision shall not apply to buildings bordering civic uses. 
(vii)  All residences shall face a public street or public alley. No garage doors will face a public street. 
(c)  Guidelines for Exterior Signage. A comprehensive sign program is required for the entire TND that establishes a uniform sign theme. Signs shall share a common style (e.g., size, shape, material). Signs for commercial uses shall be wall signs or cantilever signs. Cantilever signs shall be mounted perpendicular to the building face and shall not exceed eight square feet. 
(d)  Guidelines for Lighting. Street lighting shall be provided along all streets. Generally more, smaller lights, as opposed to fewer, high-intensity lights, should be used. Street lights shall be installed on both sides of the street at intervals of not greater than seventy-five (75) feet. Street lighting design shall meet the minimum standards developed by the Illumination Engineering Society. Lighting structures shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding area. Non-residential parking lot lighting shall be in accordance with the village's zoning ordinance. The lighting fixtures will be the village's historic poles or an approved equivalent. 
(8)  Landscaping and Screening Standards. Overall composition and location of landscaping shall complement the scale of the development and its surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed contiguous planting areas shall be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas. Where screening is required by this title, it shall be at least three feet in height, unless otherwise specified. Required screening shall be at least fifty percent (50%) opaque throughout the year. Required screening shall be satisfied by one or some combination of: a decorative fence not less than fifty percent (50%) opaque behind a continuous landscaped area, a masonry wall, or a hedge.

    During the course of inspections, the appropriate public inspector will especially note any circumstances which entail departures in the improvements from the plans and specifications as approved, such as an unforeseen difficulty in drainage, ground water, poor subsoil, unstable fill material, or unconventional or faulty practices of subcontractors. Whenever such departures are likely to cause a lower ultimate level of performance than could reasonably have been anticipated, the inspector shall prepare a report of his findings in the situation and promptly forward copies to the enforcing officers. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.28.260 - Completion, maintenance and acceptance of improvements. 
A.  Construction and Installation of Improvements 
1.  No construction of, on- and/or off-site water, sanitary sewer, street, or other public improvements will occur until the final plat is approved by the village board of trustees and recorded by the Lake County Recorder of Deeds. 
2.  The subdivider or developer shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the village board of trustees and shall maintain same for the period specified. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvements, the subdivider or developer shall file with the village a separate suitable letter of credit, cash, or other securities for the temporary facilities which shall insure that the facilities are properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
3.  Posting of a letter of credit, cash, or other securities. 
a.  The village, at the time of final plat recording, will require the subdivider or developer to post a letter of credit, cash, or other securities in an amount estimated by the village engineer to be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost of construction of both on-site and off-site public improvements. Subdivision improvements not dedicated to the public, shall be considered public improvements for purposes of this section. Examples of these types of improvements include, but are not limited to benches, gazebos, landscaping, etc. 
b.  The depositing of any letter of credit, cash, or other securities shall comply with all ordinance requirements and said letter of credit, cash, or other securities shall be satisfactory to the village attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. 
c.  All required public improvements shall be completed within two years of the final plat recording date. The completion date shall be incorporated into the agreement depositing the cash or other securities with the village. Upon proof of difficulty, the village board of trustees may grant an extension of the completion date for a maximum period of one year. 
4.  The amount of the letter of credit, cash, or other security may be reduced upon successful completion of the improvements. The village engineer must inspect the public improvements and recommend the reduction. 
5.  A letter of credit may be reduced and cash and other securities released in part upon completion of a public improvement and then only to the ratio that the completed public improvement bears to the total improvements required. In no event shall a letter of credit be released or cash and other securities released below twenty-five percent (25%) of the principal amount unless approved by the village board of trustees. 
B.  Inspection of Improvements and Preparation of "As-Built" Plans. 
1.  Inspection by Village Engineer. The village engineer shall inspect all required improvements during construction in conformance with section 16.28.210.D. to ensure that they are installed in conformance with the regulations contained herein and the approved final engineering drawings. The subdivider or developer shall post an escrow in an amount determined by the village to pay for inspection fees and other charges as established by ordinance. The escrow will be deposited with the village, in the entire amount, prior to construction. 
2.  Corrections at Subdivider's or Developer's Expense. If the village engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been constructed and installed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the village and in conformance with the approved final engineering drawings, the subdivider or developer shall be responsible for completing and correcting the required improvements, before same shall be accepted by the village. The corrections and/or completions must be performed within thirty (30) days of the date of inspection. This date can be extended upon approval by the village engineer. 
3.  Preparation of "As-Built" Plans. "As-built" plans showing the location, size and invert elevations of all valves, manholes, stubs, sewer and water mains, and other improvements shall be prepared at the end of construction and submitted to the village engineer for review. The village engineer will review the "as-built" plans and compare them with the approved final engineering drawings. In addition, the village will conduct any field inspections necessary to ensure the validity of the "as-built" plans. If in the opinion of the village engineer there are unacceptable differences in the two drawings, the subdivider or developer will correct those differences. The approval of these "as-built" plans will occur before acceptance of the improvements and release of any letter of credit, cash, or other securities. The approved set of plans or a reproducible copy thereof will become property of the village. 
C.  Dedication and Acceptance of Improvements. 
l.  Dedication of Improvements. 
a.  All improvements to be constructed and installed as required hereunder, as specified in the final engineering drawings or as required by the village board, shall be dedicated to the village unless the village board of trustees specifically authorizes otherwise. 
b.  The street system and its appurtenances may be completed upon seventy-five percent (75%) of the total units being occupied in a subdivision with the approval of the village engineer. Upon completion and approval by the village engineer, the subdivider or developer can deposit with the village a sum equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the value of the street system work. This deposit will relieve the subdivider or developer of any further maintenance responsibility, including the one-year guarantee which would otherwise be required. 
c.  Title to the improvements required to be dedicated to the village shall be transferred by bill of sale, with proof of ownership in the grantor and evidence that said improvements are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances, which shall be in a form acceptable to the village attorney, and which will include lien waivers from all major subcontractors and material men. 
D.  Maintenance of Improvements. 
1.  Maintenance of Non-Accepted Improvements at Subdivider's or Developer's Expense. The subdivider or developer shall maintain and repair all required improvements including snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if necessary, until acceptance of said improvements by the village board of trustees. If necessary maintenance and repairs are not made to the required improvements in a timely fashion by the subdivider or developer, the village may, on twelve (12) hours' notice, effect such repairs or maintenance, including snow plowing and shall charge the costs of same to the subdivider or developer. 
2.  Filing of Maintenance Retention or Guarantee: At the Option of the Village Board of Trustees. 
a.  The subdivider or developer shall file a maintenance letter of credit, cash or other security with the village prior to the dedication of the improvements, in an amount considered adequate by the village engineer and in a form satisfactory to the village attorney, in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of one year after the date of their acceptance by the village board of trustees. 
b.  The village shall retain a portion of the letter of credit, cash, or other securities, posted in conformance with section 16.28.260.A.3a of this title, equal to five percent of the cost of the accepted improvements. This guarantee shall be retained for a period of one year after the date of the acceptance of the dedicated improvements by the village board of trustees. During this period, the funds shall be used to pay for the cost of any repairs to the accepted improvements not paid for by the subdivider or developer. At the end of the period, any remaining funds shall be returned to the subdivider or developer. 
c.  The final release of the sum of five percent of the original letter of credit covering a subdivision's public improvement work held for the one-year guarantee period will be predicated upon an inspection of all improvements. 
This test will be performed by an approved qualified leak detection specialist. The test results will be forwarded to the village engineer for final determination of an acceptable level of leakage. The village engineer will then, based on the test results, recommended final release of the Letter of Credit sum still being held for water main guarantee. 
E.  Cost of Improvements to the Village. 
1.  Required Improvements at Subdivider's or Developers Expense. All costs related to the construction and installation of the required improvements shall be borne by the subdivider or developer, and said improvements shall be dedicated to the village without charge. 
2.  Over-Sized Improvements. Wherever necessary to conform to the comprehensive plan of the village, or otherwise to protect or promote the public interest, the village may require that the required improvements be over-sized. The cost to construct and install such over-sized facilities by the subdivider or developer shall be no greater than that which would result from the construction and installation of improvements sized for his own subdivision. The excess cost resulting from the requirement of over-sizing the improvement shall be borne by the village or appropriate public authority, or by other affected property owners in a recapture ordinance, or in an abatement of a portion of required tap-on fees and charges, as specified by the village board of trustees at the time of approval of the detailed engineering drawings.

This land or cash or combination thereof shall be provided in accordance with the following criteria and formula: 
A.  Criteria for Park and Recreational Land Requirements. 
1.  Land Requirement and Population Ratio. The amount of land required for dedication for park and recreational purposes shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of a proposed development. The total requirement shall be fifteen (15) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population computed in accordance with the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, contained herein. 
2.  Location. The location and configuration of the site to be dedicated shall be determined by the village board upon recommendation of the plan commission/zoning board of appeals and in consultation with the park district, which shall take into account the comprehensive plan of the village, the suitability of the site of park purposes or development, its relationship to population concentrations and its proximity to other park or recreational lands. Donated land should be reasonably accessible and should be centrally located to all lots within the impacted area where feasible. 
3.  Minimum Size, Topography, Soils, Improvements and Landscaping. 
a.  Minimum Size. The minimum size of any land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be no less than one acre, one dimension of which cannot be less than one hundred (100) feet (except that the plan commission/zoning board of appeals may recommend and the village board of trustees may approve dedications of similar sizes, when required by the specific plans of the development and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated.) 
b.  Topography and Soils. 
1)  Site must be graded to meet existing topography and to meet existing drainage patterns. 
2)  At least eighty percent (80%) of the donated land for park and recreational purposes shall be suitable in topography and soil types for recreational facilities. 
3)  Soil shall allow construction of recreational facilities and have a soil bearing capacity to support recreational facilities; recreational facilities are defined as: 
    Buildings and other physical features set aside in a park site that are used by participants of the community. Examples of recreational facilities include, but are not limited to, swimming pool complex, playground, picnic shelter, picnic sites, baseball/softball field, football/soccer field, various game activity courts, tennis court, basketball court, volleyball court, restroom/storage building, community center and waterfront area.

3.  Location. The comprehensive plan of the village and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating school sites. 
C.  Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of Park and School Sites. Where the development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site, as determined by the village board of trustees, the subdivider or developer shall pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land required. 
1.  Cash Contribution in Lieu of Park and Recreational Land Dedication. The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedications shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreational land, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any existing local park and recreational land which already services such needs. 
2.  Cash Contribution in Lieu of School Site Dedications. The cash contributions in lieu of school site dedications shall be held in trust by the village or the public body designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of students from that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any existing school site which already serves such needs. 
3.  Refund of Cash Contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedication, or cash contribution in lieu of school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein seven years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer who made such contributions, along with any accrued interest earned on such funds. 
4.  Fair Market Value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the acres of undeveloped land in the area to be improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreational and school sites. 
a.  It has been determined that the present "fair market value" of such undeveloped land in and surrounding the Village to be improved as specified herein, is one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per acre, and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein, unless the subdivider or developer and affected school district or park district files a written objection thereto. 
b.  In the event of any objection to the "fair market value" specified in subparagraph a. above, the objecting party shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of said undeveloped land in the area of the proposed development. The final determination of said "fair market value" per acre of said undeveloped land shall be made by the village board of trustees based upon such information submitted by the objecting party, along with any response thereto by the subdivider or developer, or by the affected school district or park district. 
5.  Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee. A combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required, when: 
a.  The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient for the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. 
b.  A major part of the local park or recreational site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed form the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
6.  Criteria for a Fully Developed Park. A fully developed park, including appropriate lighting, grading, landscaping, and recreational equipment, may be required when the availability of land for park land is limited and where the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision can be satisfied with a smaller but fully developed park with a more intensive activity level. 
D.  Density Formula. The "Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit", dated December 15, 1981 and prepared by Illinois School Consulting Service, Box 329, Naperville, Illinois 60566 (a copy of which table has been placed on file in the office of the village clerk of this village at the village hall and by reference is hereby made a part hereof), is generally indicative of trends in family size for new construction, and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof, unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer. 
E.  Reservation of Additional Land. Where the comprehensive plan or standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision or development than the subdivider or developer is required to dedicate, the land needed in excess of required dedication shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village, provided that such acquisition is started within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
F.  Combining with Adjoining Developments. Park or recreational land dedications and school site dedication may be combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions and developments in order to produce usable recreational areas or school sites without hardship on a particular developer. 
G.  Topography and Grading. The slope, topography, and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites for park and recreational uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. 
H.  Improved Sites. All sites shall have a portion of their frontage improved with water and sanitary utility lines, electrical service, and fully improved streets. 
I.  Dedication Required as Part of Annexation Agreement or Special Use Permit. The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof required by this title shall also be required as a condition to the annexation of any land to the village and/or the issuance of any special use permit. Dedications of land or cash in lieu thereof as specified in any annexation agreement or special use permit which are in substantial conformance with the requirements of this title shall be deemed to have fulfilled the dedication requirements of this title. 
J.  Dedication at Time of Approval of Final Plat. Approval of any final plat of subdivision or any final planned unit development plat shall be conditioned upon the dedication of land or cash donations in lieu thereof as required by this title. Dedications of such land or cash in lieu thereof may be made at such other time as is specifically approved by the village board of trustees. 
K.  On-Site Storage. No storage of any equipment and/or material, including spoil materials or top soil, shall be permitted on any land designated for park and recreational use or for school sites. 
L.  1.  All land being dedicated to the Grayslake Community Park District shall conform to the following: 
a.  Title insurance in the amount of the value of the park site from a title insurance company reasonably accepted by the park district with no unacceptable conditions.

Sections: 

16.36.010 - Procedure. 
    In all cases, the vacation of any plat, or part thereof, or any public right-of-way, easement or part thereof, shall follow the procedure for the review of plats established in the subdivision regulations except:

(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.36.020 - Standards. 
    The plat officer and the other administrative officers shall recommend disapproval of any petition for vacation which fails to meet the following standards: 
A.  No vacation shall be approved which creates a condition which would not be permitted under the standards of design set forth herein unless such vacation will at the same time correct a more serious condition which exists contrary to the standards of the subdivision regulations. 
B.  No vacation shall be approved which will result in a violation of the village zoning ordinance or other applicable ordinances or regulations, unless such vacation will at the same time correct a more serious condition which exists contrary to such ordinances or regulations. 
(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.36.030 - Petition form and content. 
    The sketch and preliminary plat of vacation shall be accompanied by a certified statement of the assessed valuation of all properties surrounding any public right-of-way to be vacated. Final petitions for vacation shall include the following items: 
A.  Three copies of the original plat certified by the Recorder to be a true copy of same, on which is shown the portion to be vacated outlined in a heavy line and hatched.

16.36.040 - Easements. 
    The vacation of any plat or part thereof, or right-of-way, easement, or part thereof, shall not be deemed to be a vacation of the rights of any public utility where said public utility has installed its facilities therein. All such vacations shall be made upon the express condition that the abutting property owner(s) grant to all public utilities, their successors and assigns, the right-of-way or easement to operate, maintain, renew, and reconstruct their facilities, over, or under the public right-of-way or easement vacated and such condition shall be noted in the deed or plat of vacation and in the ordinance or resolution of vacation.

(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.36.060 - Limitation.

(Ord. 2009-0-04, § 2) 
16.36.080 - Cancellation of bonded contracts.

17.08 ZONES AND ZONE REGULATIONS
17.08.010 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONES
The intent of this section is to create a series of zones of such number and character as are necessary to achieve compatibility of
uses within each zone, to implement the intent of the Official Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and to complement the Official
Zoning Map of the Municipality. For the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance, all land and water areas in the Municipality are
hereby divided into the following zones:
A. RESIDENTIAL 1 (R1): The R1 zone is established to provide for low density area in which the principal use of land is
for single family residences:
A-1. RESIDENTIAL 1A (R1A): The R1A zone is established to permit single family dwellings on lots of 20,000 square
feet.
B. RESIDENTIAL 2 (R2): The R2 zone is established to provide areas for single family dwellings in areas where
community water supply and community sewage disposal facilities essential to public health are available or can be
made available in the future.
B-1. RESIDENTIAL 2A (R2A): The R2A zone is established to provide for single-family dwellings and other uses
authorized in the R2 zone on lot sizes smaller than those authorized in the R2 zone and larger than those authorized in
the R3A zone, but of a similar urban character. In these areas, community water supply and sewage disposal facilities are
available or can be made available in the future.
C. RESIDENTIAL 3A (R3A): The R3A zone is established to provide areas for single family dwellings on lot sizes
smaller than the R2 zone, but of a similar urban character. In these areas, community water supply and sewage disposal
facilities are available or can be made available in the future.
D. RESIDENTIAL 3B (R3B): The R3B zone is established to provide for single-family dwellings and other uses
authorized in the R2 zone on lot sizes smaller than those authorized in the R2 zone and larger than those authorized in
the R3A zone, but of a similar urban character. In these areas, community water supply and sewage disposal facilities are
available or can be made available in the future.
E. RESIDENTIAL 4 (R4): The R4 zone is established to provide the full range of residential housing types in a higher
density environment where all of the facilities for urban living, including community sewer and water facilities, are
available.
F. RESIDENTIAL 4A (R4A): The R4A zone is established to provide areas for low density attached dwelling units where
all the facilities for urban living, including community water and sewer, are available.
G. RESIDENTIAL 5 (R5): The R5 zone is established to provide high density urban living in certain particularly desirable
areas where all of the facilities for urban living, including community sewer and water facilities are available.
H. RESIDENTIAL 6 (R6): The R6 zone is established to provide high density urban living in certain particularly desirable
areas where all of the facilities for urban living including community sewer and water facilities are available.
I. CENTRAL BUSINESS (CB): This business zone is established to provide pedestrian-oriented areas for commercial
establishments which offer a wide range of goods and services.
J. CENTRAL BUSINESS A (CBA): This business zone is established to provide pedestrian oriented areas for
commercial establishments which offer a wide range of goods and services with required off street parking.
K. COMMERCIAL TRANSITION (CT): The Commercial Transition District is characterized by residential structures
suitable for use as small businesses or offices. Typically, the CT District is located on primary and secondary
thoroughfares or is adjacent to other commercial areas where single-family structures are being, or should be, converted
to low intensity commercial uses, while remaining compatible with the contiguous single-family neighborhood. Also
permitted in this district are new structures which can architecturally blend in with neighboring residential buildings. The
uses permitted are characterized by a low volume of traffic and limited outdoor advertising so as to protect the abutting
and surrounding residential districts. This district is normally small in size and often serves as a buffer between
residential and other commercial areas. No new principal residential structures are permitted to be constructed in this
district, except to replace an existing such structure.
K-1. COMMERCIAL TRANSITION LIMITED (CTL): The CTL Zone is characterized by residential structures suitable
for use as small businesses or offices. Typically, the CTL District is located on primary and secondary thoroughfares or
is adjacent to other commercial areas where single family structures are being, or should be, converted to low intensity
commercial uses, while remaining compatible with the contiguous single family neighborhood. Also permitted in this
District are new structures which architecturally blend in with neighboring residential buildings. The uses permitted are
characterized by a low volume of traffic and limited outdoor advertising so as to protect the abutting and surrounding
residential districts. The permitted uses are more restrictive in nature than those allowed in the Commercial Transition
(CT) zone. This District is normally small in size and often serves as a buffer between residential and other commercial
areas. Intense landscape buffering will be required when abutting a residential zone. No new principal residential
structures are permitted to be constructed except to replace an existing such structure. In addition to the standards
enumerated above, this District will be characterized by more restrictive parking and lighting requirements.
L. SHOPPING CENTER BUSINESS (SCB): This business zone is established to control business development of the
shopping center variety wherein two or more businesses are grouped together with a common parking lot and common
driveways for access to the parking and the establishments.
M. GENERAL BUSINESS (GB): This business zone is established to provide areas for commercial establishments in freestanding
buildings with all required off-street parking located on site.
N. OFFICE AND RESEARCH (OR): The OR zone is established to provide large, open, landscaped sites, generally
adjacent to primary highways, for "show place" operations such as research laboratories.
O. LIMITED INDUSTRIAL (LI): This industrial zone is established to provide areas for industrial, office, and
administrative uses, having few, if any, adverse effects on neighboring properties.
P. GENERAL INDUSTRIAL (GI): This industrial zone is established to provide areas in which manufacturing and
related commercial operations are the principal use of land. Such uses may have some adverse effects on surrounding
properties and are not compatible with residential, limited industrial and retail uses.
Q. LIMITED INDUSTRIAL (LIA): This industrial zone is established to provide areas for smaller industrial, office and
administrative uses, having few, if any, adverse effects on neighboring properties.
R. AGRICULTURAL (AG): The AG Zone is established as a zone in which agricultural and certain related uses are
encouraged as the principal uses of the land. The specific intent is to facilitate the proper use of lands best suited to
agriculture through preventing the admixture of urban and rural uses which creates incompatibility and conflict, places
unbalanced tax loads on agricultural land to help pay for urban services, and contributes to the premature termination of
agricultural pursuits.
S. OPEN SPACE (OS): The Open Space Zoning District is hereby established to recognize the existence and encourage
the preservation of major open space and recreational areas in the Village. The zone is intended to apply to all public
open space of notable quality.
W. MIXED USE (MX): The Mixed Use Zoning District is established to provide for the development of parcels in excess
of 500 acres that, due to their size, can sustain a wide array of uses that might otherwise be allowed in any of the other
zoning districts of the Village. Parcels zoned in the MX District will be permitted to develop as of right under the
regulations applicable to the AG zoning district regulations. Pursuant to a planned development approval based on a
master plan for the entire parcel, however, properties in the MX zone may be developed and used for any use otherwise
permitted or specifically permitted under the Zoning Ordinance provided that such use is expressly authorized as part of
the planned development approvals. Any planned development approval shall also establish all applicable bulk, yard,
space, height, and other requirements governing the development of properties within the MX District.

B. INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
It is the purpose of this section to establish regulations and standards for the installation and operation of
industrial uses, based upon consideration of the objectionable characteristics of such uses and the zones in
which they are permitted. Further, this section is intended to prescribe procedures and methods of
measurement of industrial characteristics subject to such standards.
Any use permitted in the OR, LI, LIA and GI zones, whether such use is permitted as a principal use or an
accessory use, shall be subject to these requirements:
1. Permit Procedure: Before a building permit is issued for a use in an OR, LI, or GI zone, the
applicant shall furnish the Building Department sufficient information to enable the Building
Department to assure the Village that all performance standards set forth in the Zoning Ordinance
can and will be complied with at all times. All information and evidence submitted in applications
to indicate conformity to performance standards shall constitute a certification and an agreement
on the part of the applicant that the proposed use can and will conform to such standards at all
times.
The Building Department, in order to determine whether or not the applicant will meet such
standards, shall require the applicant to submit the following information:
a. A plot plan showing the location of all present and proposed structures, drives, parking
lots, waste disposal areas, bulk storage areas, streets, streams, or other significant features
on or within two hundred (200) feet of the proposed site.
b. A description of the activity to be conducted regarding waste products, external effects or
other conditions which are regulated herein; provided, however, that the applicant shall
not be required to reveal any trade secrets or sufficient detail with regard to a process
which would cause any secret process or manufacturing procedure for a closely guarded
proprietary compound or product to become public knowledge and be available to
competitors.

Department to reach a determination.
When a new or altered use in an OR, LI, LIA or GI zone is proposed that may, in the opinion of
the Building Department, involve a possible violation of the regulations in Subsection (B 2) the
Building Department shall, as a condition precedent to issuing a building permit, require the
deposit in escrow of one thousand ($1000) dollars for a period of one (1) year from the date of the

Appeals of such required deposit in escrow. Escrow deposits or remainders of escrow deposits

violated, the Department may employ a qualified technician or technicians to perform
investigations, measurements, and analyses to determine whether or not the regulations
are being violated and may pay their reasonable fee out of the aforementioned escrow
deposit, regardless of the outcome of the investigations. If the reasonable fees of such
technician or technicians exceed the amount of any available escrow deposit, and if a
violation of this section is discovered, the fees may be recovered as a penalty in the same
manner specified herein.
b. In cases not covered by escrow deposit but in which, in the opinion of the Building
Department, there is reasonable probability that any use or occupancy violates the
regulations of this section, the Department is hereby empowered to employ a qualified
technician, or technicians to perform investigations, measurements and analyses to
determine whether or not the regulations of this section are being violated. In the event
that a violation is found to exist, the violators shall be liable for the reasonable fees of the
technicians employed to perform such investigations, measurements, and analyses. Such
fees may be recovered as a penalty in the same manner specified herein.
c. In addition, the Village may require the installation, maintenance, and operation by the
offending industry of continuous measuring recording instruments to demonstrate the
operation and to ensure continuous compliance with the prescribed standards.

personal wireless services antenna or antenna support structure may provide that:
1) where the provider of personal wireless services is not the owner of the land on
which such antenna or structure is located, the term of the special use permit is
limited to the term of the lease or other agreement granting rights to use the
land; and
2) the special use permit shall be subject to review by the Board of Trustees, at ten
(10) year intervals, to determine whether the technology in the provision of
personal wireless services has changed such that the necessity for the special
permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or modified, and whether
the special use permit should be modified or terminated as a result of any such
change
55
o. Abandonment and Removal. When one or more antennas, antenna support structures,
and/or related equipment are not operated for the provision of personal wireless services
for a continuous period of twelve (12) months or more, such antenna, antenna support
structure, and/or related equipment shall be deemed to be abandoned and the special use
permit therefore shall become null and void, regardless of the intent of the owner or
operator thereof. For purposes of this paragraph "operate" shall mean the active use of the
specially permitted facilities in the provision of the services for which they were designed
and constructed for a period of at least seven consecutive days in each of the four
proceeding calendar quarters.
The owner of any abandoned antenna, antenna support structure, and/or related
equipment shall remove such items within ninety (90) days following the mailing of
written notice from the Village that removal is required. Such notice shall be sent by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the Village to such owner at the
last known address of such owner. If two or more providers of personal wireless services
use the antenna support structure and/or related equipment to provide personal wireless
services, then the period of non-operation under this provision shall be measured from the
cessation of operation at the location of such antenna support structure and/or related
equipment by all such providers.
Any owner receiving a notice from the Village pursuant to this subsection may appeal
such determination of abandonment by filing a notice of appeal with the Zoning Board of
Appeals in accordance with Subsection 17.40.010 of this Ordinance and Section 11-13-
12 of the Illinois Municipal Code 65 ILCS 5/11-13/12. The notice of appeal shall set
forth all bases on which owner relies to assert that no such abandonment has occurred.
p. Additional Standards for Review. In addition to the special use standards contained in
this Section 22.206, and the requirements of this Subsection, the following factors may be
also considered in the review of a special use permit for personal wireless services
antennas, with or without antenna support structures, and related electronic and
equipment structures:
1) Where the antenna support structure is a tower, the height thereof, its proximity
to residential structures and residential district boundaries, and the design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating, or failing to
reduce or eliminate, the visual obtrusiveness thereof;
2) The nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby property;
3) The surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage; and
4) The availability of suitable lawfully existing structures, as described in
Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Paragraph 11.
q. Application Requirements. In addition to such other information and data ordinarily
required in connection with an application for a special use permit, an applicant for a
special use permit for a personal wireless services antenna or related structures or
equipment shall submit to the Village as part of its application at least the following
information: A scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting
drawings, calculations, and documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed
professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including

A Special Use Permit may be granted to allow pet sitting services on a lot. Such services would
allow care of pets that are ordinarily housed at another location. The service shall include but not
be limited to interactive dog play, dog socialization, and physical activity. In granting a Special
Use Permit for pet sitting services, restrictions may be imposed on the maximum number of
animals in attendance at the pet sitting service, as well as the maximum number of animals
permitted to be boarded overnight as part of the pet sitting services. The Special Use Permit may
also place restrictions on outdoor uses in connection with a pet sitting service.
11.A. Overnight Uses in Certain L1or G1 District Areas.
Whenever any premises on a lot within the L1 or G1 District is restricted from overnight uses
pursuant to Section 17.20.030.H of this Chapter, a special use permit may be granted to allow the
use of such premises during the hours of 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the following day (or such
portion thereof as may be approved as part of the special use permit), subject to such terms and
conditions as may be established to protect abutting residentially zoned properties, which
conditions may include but not be limited to: (i) installation of landscaped buffering; (ii)
limitations on lighting; (iii) limitations on parking; (iv) limitations on noise, vibration, and/or
types of operations; (v) limitations on the number of personnel present on the premises during the

a. Code and Plan Purpose - The proposed use and development will be in harmony with the
general and specific purposes for which this code was enacted and for which the regulations
73
of the district in question were established and with the general purpose and intent of the
Official Comprehensive Plan.
b. No Undue Adverse Impact - The proposed use and development will not have a substantial or
undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character of the area, parking, utility
facilities, and other matters affecting the public health safety, and general welfare.
c. No Interference with Surrounding Development - The proposed use and development will be
constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to
interfere with the use and development of neighboring property in accordance with the
applicable district regulations.
d. Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development will be served adequately by
essential public facilities and services such as streets, public utilities, drainage structures,
police and fire protection, refuse disposal, water and sewers, parks, libraries, and schools, or
the applicant will provide adequately for such services.
e. No Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and development will not result in
the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant
importance.
f. Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and development complies with all additional
standards imposed on, or by the particular provision of this Code authorizing such use.
15. Considerations.
In determining whether the applicant's evidence establishes that the foregoing standards have been
met, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Board of Trustees shall consider:
a. Public Benefit. Whether and what extent the proposed use and development at the
particular location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility
that is in the interest of the public convenience or that will contribute to the general
welfare of the neighborhood or community.
b. Alternative Locations. Whether and to what extent such public goals can be met by the
location of the proposed use and development at some other site or in some other area
that may be more appropriate than the proposed site.
c. Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether and to what extent all steps possible have been
taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use and development of the
immediate vicinity through building design, sign design, landscaping, and screening.
16. Conditions on Special Use Permits.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the Board of Trustees may impose such
conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping,
screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this code upon the premises
benefited by a Special Use Permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize
adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or
upon public facilities and services and to insure compliance with the standards in this Section.
Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of
any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute grounds for
revocation of the Special Use Permit.
74
17. Bus Terminal Facility.
A special use permit may be granted to allow bus terminal facilities on a lot, provided that all of
the following conditions and standards are satisfied:
a. Bus terminal facilities shall be limited to the storage, fueling, and the maintenance and
repair of buses, as well as accessory office space and indoor storage, but only in
conformity with the terms of this Section 17.24.17 and the terms of any special use
permit approved for such use.
b. Outdoor storage of buses shall be permitted, but: (i) all such outdoor storage of buses
shall be a minimum of 500 feet from any publicly dedicated roadways; and (ii) buses
shall not be visible from adjacent publicly dedicated roadways. In addition, adequate
screening in the form of a board-on-board fence and/or landscaping as more particularly
established in the special use permit for such use shall be provided from rights-of-way
and adjacent lots.
c. A bus terminal facilities use may only be located on a zoning lot no smaller than three
acres nor larger than five acres in size. A special use permit for a bus terminal facility
may not be granted for any zoning lot located within one mile of another bus terminal
facility.

authorized, except that an inoperable bus may be temporarily stored on the site for a
period not more than 14 days.
f. Although bus terminal facilities have significant potential adverse impacts, those impacts
are mitigated to the extent that a bus terminal facility serves local school districts. In
determining whether an application for a special use permit for bus terminal facilities
satisfies the considerations in Section 17.24.C.14.a of the Zoning Code, significant
weight shall be given to whether the proposed use will be serving School District 127 and
School District 46.
g. Upon cessation of bus terminal facilities operations on a zoning lot, the special use permit
will become null and void. Cessation of bus terminal facilities operations shall mean the
non-movement of buses in and out of the zoning lot for a period of 30 or more
consecutive days (absent force majeure conditions), irrespective of intent. Any bus
terminal facilities without a valid special use permit (whether due to cessation of
operations or otherwise) shall be deemed a legal non-conforming use, but such status as a
legal non-conforming use shall be amortized over a 60-day period, after which time the
bus terminal facilities use must stop and all buses removed from the zoning lot
18. Wholesale Brewery Production Activities.
Wholesale brewery production activities shall only operate pursuant to a special use
permit and shall be subject to the following conditions and standards:

17.32 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
17.32.010 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT
The primary purpose of a Planned Unit Development ("PUD") is to stimulate the development of balanced
neighborhoods containing physical, economic, and social assets difficult to achieve through the traditional
separation of use and density zones. This is accomplished by allowing the applicant the freedom necessary to protect
natural resources, to protect and improve the social and economic environment; and to protect the investment in both
the Village and development.
A PUD should attain the following objectives:
A. The protection of both the aesthetics and function of the natural environment.
B. The arrangement of buildings and other improvements advantageous to the orderly function and aesthetics
of both the natural and man-made environment.
C. The preservation of adequate, permanent open space for the use of the residents and workers in the
development and in the Village.
D. A variety of housing types and densities necessary to achieve a balanced neighborhood.
E. The provisions of land area necessary to accommodate all cultural, educational, recreational, and other
public and quasi-public activities necessary to serve the needs of the development and/or the Village.
F. The orderly and creative arrangement of all land uses with respect to each other and to the entire Village
(including residential, commercial, industrial, and public and quasi-public.)
G. The provision of developed recreational activity areas necessary to serve the needs of any residential
portion of the development.
H. The provision of a pedestrian environment separate from the vehicular environment.
I. The creation of the neighborhoods compatible with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Village.
In order to accomplish these objectives, a PUD may be exempted from certain of the provisions of the Subdivision
Control Ordinance and the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Grayslake to the extent specified in the special use
permit for the PUD.
17.32.020 SKETCH PLAN PROCEDURE
The applicant shall submit to the Village plans and data as specified in Subsection 17.32.030B. The Sketch Plan

Ordinance to encourage their conversion to conformance where possible and to permit these nonconformances to
continue until terminated either by voluntary act, by catastrophic event, or by amortization.
17.36.020 NONCONFORMING RECORDED LOTS
A. DEFINITION
A nonconforming recorded lot is a tract of land, designated on a duly recorded subdivision plat, having less
than the minimum lot area, or width for the particular use in the zone in which it is located.
B. SEPARATE OWNERSHIP
A nonconforming recorded lot owned separately from all adjoining tracts of land of 2 September 1969 shall
be subject to the following provisions.
1. In Residential Zones
a. Permitted Uses: A nonconforming recorded lot may be used for a single family dwelling
and accessory uses.
b. Side and Rear Yards: Each side yard shall be ten (10%) percent of the lot width except
that any yard shall be a minimum of five (5) feet but need not be of greater than ten (10)
feet. The rear yard provided for the principal use shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet. No
accessory structure shall be placed closer than five (5) feet to any property line except
those structures listed in Section 17.20.030 C of this ordinance

recorded lot shall comply with the same front yard, height, structural coverage and floor
area ratio requirements as specified for the zone in which the use is located.
2. In Any Other Zone
a. Permitted Uses: A nonconforming recorded lot may be used for any principal use and
accessory uses permitted in the zone in which it is located.
b. Side Yards: Each side yard required for a nonconforming recorded lot shall be
determined by multiplying the actual width of the lot by the yard required in the zone in
which the lot is located, divided by the minimum lot width required in the zone in which
the lot is located. However, nonconforming side yard shall not be less than five (5) feet.
c. Front Yard, Rear yard, Height Restrictions, Coverage and Floor Area Ratio: A
nonconforming recorded lot shall comply with the same front yard, rear yard, height

3. Evidence of Ownership
Before any building permit is issued, evidence shall be submitted to the Building Department that
the lot in question was, in fact, owned separately from all adjoining tracts of land on 2 September
1969. A letter of opinion, written by an Illinois attorney at law, may constitute such evidence.
96
C. COMMON OWNERSHIP
When two (2) or more parcels of land (which may contain a lot or lots of record) have continuous frontage
and one or more of the parcels lack adequate area or width to meet the minimum area or width requirements
of the zoning district in which the parcel or parcels are located, all of such parcels shall be considered to be
one zoning lot for the purpose of this title if such parcels were held in common ownership or use on
September 2, 1969. Lots or parts of lots resulting from the division of such parcels held in common
ownership shall not be entitled to zoning certificates or building permits as provided in this title.
D. CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR AND ALTERATION
Construction of new buildings, or repair of existing buildings that are being used for permitted uses but are
located on nonconforming recorded lots, shall be permitted. If any building is damaged or destroyed, it can
be rebuilt for its original permitted use to the extent of its original development, or a new building can be
constructed for any use to the extent permitted in Subsection B above.
17.36.030 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
A. DEFINITIONS
1. A nonconforming use is an activity using land or structures or both, legally established prior to the
effective date of the Zoning Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto, which would not be
permitted as a new use in the zone in which it is located under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance.
2. A nonconforming structure is one which was legally constructed prior to the effective date of the
Zoning Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto, which would not be permitted as a new
structure under the terms of the Ordinance because such structure is not in conformance with the
yards, height, coverage, or floor area ratio requirements of the zone in which it is located. A
structure located on a nonconforming recorded lot is not classified as a nonconforming structure
solely because of insufficient lot area or width, nor shall anything herein be construed to affect the
provisions contained in Section 17.36.020, above.
B. NONCONFORMING USE AND STRUCTURE REGULATIONS
Any building or structure containing a nonconforming use, except a residential use for a single-family
dwelling or any nonconforming structure, except a single-family dwelling, shall be subject to the following
regulations:
1. If any building or structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50%)
percent of the replacement cost of that portion of the principal and accessory buildings which are
above grade, such building or structure shall not be rebuilt or reoccupied for any use except in
accordance with the zone regulations of the zone in which it is located.
2. Damage to an extent less than that of Section B.1 shall be repaired in a manner as nearly
conforming as possible.
3. Normal maintenance and repairs shall be permitted.
4. Enlargements or alterations of a nonconforming structure or use of land shall not be permitted
except when such changes result in bringing the nonconformance into compliance with the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to any other use
than one permitted in the zone in which it is located.
97
5. Discontinuation of a nonconforming use of land or of a structure for any reason for a period of
more than one (1) year shall be considered abandonment of that use. Such use shall not be reestablished,
and any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the regulations of the
zone in which it is located.
6. Industrial uses which are nonconforming by virtue of being located in a non-industrial zone shall
be subject to the performance standards applicable in the LI zone. Alterations and repairs as
provided in Subsection B.2 shall be done in a manner as nearly conforming as possible to the LI
zone performance standards. For industries which are located in an industrial zone and which fail
to comply with the performance standards of the zone in which they are located, enlargements,
repairs, or alterations shall be made in a manner as conforming as possible to the industrial
performance standards of the zone in which the industry is located. The degree of conformance
possible shall be determined by the Building Department; appeals may be made to the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
C. ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMING INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES
Nonconforming uses shall cease opportunities in accordance with the following amortization schedules:
1. In all residential zones, any nonconforming commercial or industrial use shall cease operations
within twenty (20) years after the effective date of this Ordinance.
2. In all commercial zones, any nonconforming industrial use shall cease operations within twenty
(20) years after the effective date of this Ordinance.
3. The nonconforming use of land shall be discontinued and shall cease five (5) years from the
effective date of this Ordinance in the following instances:
a. Where no structures are employed in connection with the use.
b. When the only structures or other physical improvements are accessory or incidental to
such use.
4. A nonconforming accessory use shall cease operations at such time as the principal use ceases
operations.
5. The Village Board of Trustees shall set the amortization period for any use or structure which
would be nonconforming upon annexation to the Village.

or requirements shall control.
B. EXISTING PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS
1. Building Permits

structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of the relevant portion of the Zoning
Ordinance; and such permit has not, by its own terms, expired prior to such effective date; and the

necessary for the protection of the public interest.
4. Issuance of Permit
Upon completion of the necessary application and hearing by the Zoning Board, the Village Board
shall either approve or disapprove the application, and where approved, shall establish the specific
conditions under which the application is approved. If the Village Board approves the application,
the Building Department shall issue the special use permit subject to all applicable rules,
regulations and conditions.

public hearing and the applicant shall be provided with either a special use permit or written notice

7. Revocation of a Special Use Permit
In any case where a building permit for a special use has not been issued and construction activity
carried to completion within one (1) year after the date of the issuing of the special use permit
therefore, or if the special use has been abandoned or discontinued for a period of one (1) year,
then the Village Board of Trustees, on its own motion, after a public hearing before the Zoning
Board of Appeals, may revoke the permit for the special use and may change the underlying
zoning district if such was amended at the time of the issuance of the special use permit.
103
B. VARIATIONS
It is the intent of the Zoning Ordinance to use the variation only to modify the application of the Zoning
Ordinance to achieve a parity among properties similarly located and classified. Specifically, it is to be
used to overcome some exceptional physical condition which poses practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship in such a way as to prevent an owner from using his property as intended by the Zoning
Ordinance.
1. Application
After denial of a building permit by the Building Department, a property owner may apply to the
Zoning Board of Appeals for a variation, using forms obtainable from the Building Department.
2. Public Hearing
Upon receipt of an application and fee, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing,
after giving fifteen (15) days notice as provided by law. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
prepare findings of fact and shall make its recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees
within 30 days of the public hearing.
3. Standards for Variations
The Village Board of Trustees shall grant a variation whenever, and only when, it shall have
determined and recorded in writing that all of the following conditions have been met.
a. That the variation does not permit a use otherwise excluded from the particular zone in
which requested.
b. That special circumstances or conditions such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or
siting apply to the land for which a variation is sought, and that those conditions do not
apply generally in the zone
c. That the special circumstances or conditions have not resulted from any act of the
applicant subsequent to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, whether or not in violation
of the provisions thereof.
d. That the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would result in a practical difficulty or a particular
hardship to the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
e. That the variation granted is the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of
the land.
f. That the granting of any variation is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of
the Zoning Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to the
public welfare, or in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan of the Village.
4. Vote Requirements
Any proposed variation which fails to receive the approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
not be passed except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all of the trustees of the Village.
5. Revocation of Variance(s)
104
In any case where a variation has not been utilized by the property owner within two (2) years
after the date of granting the variation, then the Village Board of Trustees, on its own motion, and
after a public hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals, may revoke the variance(s).

published in the Village, or in such other manner as may be authorized or permitted by
statute.
c. Any petitioner for a change in zoning classification attached to his property shall prepare
and submit to the Village at the time of the filing of his petition an accurate list of the
names and addresses of all property owners within a 250 foot distance of all boundaries

property owners, provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals may waive this requirement
or may approve some alternative means of notice for any petition concerning property in
