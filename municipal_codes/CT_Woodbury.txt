days of receipt of said notice, file a written request for review with the First Selectman. Failure to
timely file such request for review shall make the licensing authority's action final and binding upon

the licensing authority's action.
Special appeals board; hearing. The First Selectman shall appoint forthwith a special appeals
board consisting of two electors of the Town and two licensed refuse collectors and a member of
the Board of Selectmen, and said special appeals board shall then within 15 days from the date of

suspend such license should be affirmed, modified, or reversed. Such hearing shall be private;
except, however, such hearing may be public if so requested, in writing, by the refuse collector.
The decision of said board shall be final and binding upon the refuse collector.
Names, addresses of customers to be furnished upon revocation or suspension. Whenever a
refuse collector's license or registration is revoked or suspended, he shall furnish the Board of
Selectmen within 24 hours with the names and addresses of his customers, to ensure continuity of
service.

may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or
waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to
persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation
of this article may have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement
agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
§ 208-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a
form acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 208-10. Monitoring of discharges.
Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with
industrial activity, including construction activity.
Access to facilities.
The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records
that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.

The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its
own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral
request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the
operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this article.
If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of
a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 208-11. Use of best management practices to prevent, control
and reduce stormwater pollutants.
The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to
prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance
with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 208-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 208-13. Notification of spills.

operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any
known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the United States, said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement
agency within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 208-14. Enforcement.
Notice of violation. Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the authorized enforcement agency
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may
require, without limitation:

Suspension of any discharge to the MS4 system consistent with § 208-8 of this article; and
The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set
forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Where
elimination is not possible within 60 days of source confirmation, a schedule for its elimination will
be set for no more than 180 days. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to
remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
§ 208-15. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement
agency. The notice of appeal must be received within 30 days from the date of the notice of violation.
Hearing on the appeal before the Board of Selectmen or its designee shall take place within 30 days
from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the Board of Selectmen or its designee

After a highway or portion thereof has been designated as a scenic road it shall be maintained by
the Town in good and sufficient repair and in passable condition. No material changes shall be
made in the width of the travelled portion, the alignment, the grade or the elevation of the road, or
the type of roadway surface, the location of stone walls, or mature tree configuration or the
installation or replacement of guard rails without the approval of the Planning Commission.
Routine road maintenance may be performed by the Town without the approval of the Planning
Commission. Routine road maintenance shall include: correction of drainage problems;
retreatment and repair of existing road surfaces; the removal of dead trees or branches; trimming
of tree branches encroaching on the travelled portion of the road below the height needed for
passage of school buses and emergency vehicles and to preserve sight lines; trimming of tree
branches encroaching on utility lines; trimming of brush to enhance and protect scenic views,
stone walls, mature trees, and other characteristics of the scenic road set forth in its description.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit a person owning or occupying land abutting a

purpose of eligibility for such reimbursement.
§ 218-6. Contracts for abatement.
The Board of Selectmen may, by majority vote, enter into contracts for the Town with owners of lowand
moderate-income housing granting abatement, in whole or in part, of the real property taxes on
such housing, provided that such abatement need not be conditioned upon receipt of state
reimbursement to the Town for such abatement; and further provided that each such contract shall
require that the owner apply the money equivalent of the taxes so abated to one or more of the
following specified purposes:
To reduce rents below the levels which would be achieved in the absence of abatement and to
improve the quality and design of such housing;
To effect occupancy by elderly persons of varying income levels, within the prescribed limits; or
To provide necessary related facilities or services in such housing.
§ 218-7. Term.
The abatement shall become effective on the date specified in the contract between the Town and the
owner of the low- and moderate-income housing. The term of the abatement shall extend for the
remainder of the fiscal year in which such abatement becomes effective and may continue for a period
not to exceed 39 consecutive fiscal years thereafter or may continue for a period not to exceed 50
consecutive fiscal years thereafter, provided, in the latter case, that such contract is acceptable to the
state for purpose of reimbursement pursuant to C.G.S. § 8-216 for the first 40 consecutive fiscal years
thereof; provided, in either event, that such abatement shall terminate at any time when the real
property for which the tax abatement had been granted is not used solely for low- and moderateincome
housing.

For purposes of this article, the present true and actual value of low- and moderate-income housing on
which rents and carrying charges are limited by regulatory agreement with, or otherwise regulated by,

Article IV. Relief for Elderly and Permanently Disabled
Homeowners
[Adopted 11-15-2004 (Ch. 10, § 10-5, of the Town Code)]
§ 218-12. Purpose and intent; amount of abatement.
The purpose and intent of this article is to establish a tax relief program in accordance with C.G.S.
§ 12-129n, as amended, to assist elderly or disabled residents of the Town of Woodbury with their real
property taxes. Eligible participants will receive a tax abatement applied against their principal
residence, in addition to the abatement provided under C.G.S. § 12-129b, pro rata to the participant's
percentage of ownership of the subject property.
§ 218-13. Limitations.
The total amount of property tax relief that may be had with respect to any property, when
combined with any tax relief for which such taxpayer may be eligible in accordance with C.G.S.
§§ 12-129b to 12-129d inclusive, or § 12-170aa, shall not exceed in the aggregate 75% of the
subject property tax.
The property tax relief shall apply only to the residence itself, its immediate outbuildings, and the
building lot on which the residence is located, up to the amount of the minimum lot size specified
for the zoning district in which the lot is located.
The total of all tax relief granted under the provisions of this tax relief program shall, in any fiscal
year, not exceed 0.5% of the total real estate property tax assessment in the Town of Woodbury in
the preceding fiscal year. In the event the total calculated tax relief would exceed the above
limitations, the individual abatements shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis.
§ 218-14. Eligibility.
[Amended 5-21-2018]
Any person who owns real property in the Town of Woodbury or who is liable for the payment of taxes
thereon under C.G.S. § 12-48 and who occupies that property as his or her principal residence, or held

Sixty-five years of age or over at the close of the calendar year preceding the period in which
a claim for relief is filed; or whose spouse living with him or her is 65 years of age or over at
the close of the calendar year preceding the period in which a claim for relief is filed; or such
person is 60 years of age or over and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer qualified in
Woodbury under this article at the time of his or her death or with respect to real property on
which such applicant or his or her spouse is liable for taxes under C.G.S. § 12-48; or
Under 65 years of age and eligible in accordance with applicable federal regulations to
receive permanent total disability benefits under social security, or has not been engaged in
employment covered by social security and accordingly has not qualified for benefits
thereunder, but has become qualified for permanent total disability benefits under any federal,
state, or local government retirement disability plan, including the Railroad Retirement Act
and any government-related teacher's retirement plan, in which requirements with respect to
qualifications for such permanent total disability benefits are comparable to such
requirements under social security.
The applicant and/or his/her spouse under Subsection A(1) or (2) above must have been a real
property taxpayer of the Town of Woodbury for one year immediately preceding their receipt of tax
benefits under this article and meet the requirements with respect to maximum income allowance
during the calendar year preceding the year in which the application is made for the tax credit
provided in this article.
The applicants must own and occupy the real property in the Town of Woodbury for which this tax
credit is claimed as their principal residence, or the property must be held in trust for and occupied
by such resident as his or her principal residence. "Principal residence" shall be defined as
residency of at least 183 days per year in each of the three years prior to the application and in
each abated tax year thereafter. A surviving spouse is not required to have had an ownership
interest in the property prior to the applicant's death, but must be the record owner of the property
within 12 months thereafter and meet the other requirements as set forth in this article.
An applicant(s) shall individually, if unmarried, or jointly, if married, demonstrate an adjusted gross
income of $36,900 or less, in accordance with the guidelines set forth below, during the calendar
year preceding the filing of his/her application. Applicants shall demonstrate such "qualifying
income," as defined in Form M-35H of the State Circuit Breaker application, Section 7, from social
security benefits and all other income, by producing his/her Internal Revenue Service Form 1040.
In addition to meeting the "qualifying income" standards as set forth in this tax relief program, the
applicant must first apply for "Circuit Breaker" tax relief provided by the State of Connecticut. If the
applicant is denied eligibility for tax relief granted under one or more of the State Circuit Breaker
programs, the Assessor shall deny the applicant the local share of tax relief, remove the applicant
from the abatement records, and bill him/her for the full real estate tax due; provided, however,
that an unmarried applicant with an income between $26,100 and $36,900 and a married
applicant with an income between $31,900 and $36,900 shall not be required to apply for or be
granted state Circuit Breaker benefits.
All taxes due and payable to the Town of Woodbury must be paid and not be in arrears to maintain
eligibility under this tax relief program.
§ 218-15. Schedule of payments; applicability.
The Town of Woodbury shall provide tax abatement to qualified applicants on a graduated basis in

The property tax abatements provided by this article shall be in addition to those benefits available
to qualified taxpayers under C.G.S. §§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, 12-129h, and 12-170aa,
provided that the Town and state benefits in any one year shall not exceed 75% of the real
property tax, as determined by the Assessor within the applicable tax year, which would have
been imposed on a qualified taxpayer in the absence of such state statute and this tax relief
program.
§ 218-16. Application for and grant of tax relief; penalties for false
information.
Applications for this tax relief program must be made to the Assessor's office between February 1
and May 15. The applicant shall present to the Assessor, in substantiation of his/her application, a
copy of his/her federal income tax return for the calendar year immediately preceding the year of
application, or, if not required to file a return, such other evidence of qualifying income which the
Assessor may reasonably require to establish compliance with the income qualifications provided
in this article. The applicant, or his/her authorized agent, shall sign a sworn affidavit affirming the
accuracy of the statements in the application. Any falsifications of information required in any such
application shall result in a denial and/or revocation of tax relief with respect to such applicant
and/or repayment and recapture by the Town of Woodbury of any and all tax relief granted the
applicant pursuant to this program. In addition to any penalties provided for by the Connecticut
General Statutes, a taxpayer who fraudulently obtains tax benefits under this program shall be
liable for repayment of the abated taxes, interest and any cost of collecting same, including court
costs and reasonable attorney fees.
When the Assessor has determined that the applying taxpayer is entitled to tax relief under this
program, he shall compute the amount of such tax relief and cause a tax credit to be issued in
such form as to permit the Tax Collector to reduce the amount of tax levied against the taxpayer
and make proper record thereof. A copy thereof shall be delivered to the applicant.
In any case where title to real property is recorded in the name of a taxpayer or in the name of his
or her spouse, who is eligible for tax relief hereunder, and in the name of any other person or
persons, the tax relief hereunder shall be prorated to allow a tax credit equivalent to the fractional
share in the property of such taxpayer or spouse, and the persons not otherwise eligible for tax
relief shall not receive any tax credit. Furthermore, if such property is a multiple-family dwelling,
such relief shall be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of such property occupied by the
qualified applicant or his/her qualified surviving spouse.
The tax relief granted under this program shall, in each case, be for a term to correspond with the
state Circuit Breaker program. A complete and timely application, as specified in Subsection A
above, shall be required for each subsequent period of tax relief under this program.
In the event the real property of a qualified applicant is sold, assigned, granted, or conveyed
during the fiscal year when a credit is applicable, regardless of whether such transfer, assignment,
grant or conveyance was voluntary or involuntary, the amount of the tax credit shall be prorated by
the office of the Town Assessor.
The Assessor and Tax Collector shall provide such forms and institute such procedures as may be
required for the Circuit Breaker program and shall modify such form as may be necessary to
implement this tax relief program.
All applications for this program, any federal income tax returns or other personal financial
documentation filed therewith, and any additional evidence of qualifying income that the Assessor
may require to determine eligibility for this program shall be kept confidential and not open to
public inspection; provided, however, that the Tax Collector, Board of Finance and Board of
Selectmen shall be allowed access to any such information as may be required in their official
capacity.

[Adopted as Ch. 10, § 10-6, of the Town Code]
§ 218-19. Purpose and authority.
In recognition of the benefits provided to the Town of Woodbury by the dedicated service of the Town's
volunteer ambulance personnel, the Town of Woodbury herewith establishes a tax abatement program
pursuant to C.G.S. § 12-81w of the Connecticut General Statutes for eligible Woodbury volunteer
ambulance personnel under the conditions set forth below.
§ 218-20. Eligibility.
Each member of the Woodbury Ambulance Association who resides in Woodbury or owes property tax
to Woodbury shall be eligible if said member meets all the following criteria:
Said member serves as an emergency medical technician or a medical response technician.
Said member is classified as an "active member," as that term is defined in the Woodbury
Ambulance Association Bylaws.
Said member meets the training, scheduling and meeting requirements as set forth in said bylaws
for the calendar year prior to the fiscal tax year during which the abatement benefits are to be
awarded.

Annually, on or before May 1 of each year, the Woodbury Ambulance Association President shall
submit to the Woodbury First Selectman a sworn list, in affidavit form, of the members of said
Association who are eligible for said program by meeting all the criteria set forth in § 218-20 of this
article. The First Selectman shall, after review and any further verification as is deemed necessary,
deliver the list to the Woodbury Tax Collector and Tax Assessor, who shall do all things necessary to
implement the program commencing with the tax payment due July 1 of the fiscal year then next
commencing.
§ 218-22. Amount; implementation.
The abatement provided for herein shall be the maximum then allowable under state law. The
abatement shall be applied first to real property and second to personal property and motor vehicles. If
the abatement is not fully exhausted by the July 1 tax payment, it may be carried forward to the
January 1 (second half) payment in the same fiscal year. No unused portion of any abatement
remaining at the end of a given fiscal year may be carried over for use in any subsequent fiscal year.
The abatement will not be carried over for use in any subsequent fiscal year. The abatement will not be
diminished by virtue of the fact that the eligible member owns the taxable property as a joint tenant or
tenant in common with a spouse or other individual.
Article VI. Abatement for Structures of Historical or
Architectural Merit
[Adopted 5-17-2004, effective 6-7-2004 (Ch. 10, § 10-7, of the Town Code)]
§ 218-23. Abatement authorized.
Abatement of real property taxes on structures of historical or architectural merit in the Town of
Woodbury may be allowed, in whole or in part, pursuant to the authority of C.G.S. § 12-127a.
§ 218-24. Determination of historical or architectural merit.
Structures shall be classified as having historical or architectural merit if they demonstrate significant
historical or architectural value to the community, as determined in all cases by the Old Woodbury
Historical Society. In cases where such a structure lies within an historic district, the Woodbury Historic
District Commission must also concur that such structure demonstrates significant historical or
architectural value to the community.
§ 218-25. Qualifications; liability for change in status of structure.
Such tax abatement shall be available to the owners of real property which is so classified if it can be
shown to the satisfaction of the Town of Woodbury Board of Selectmen that the real property is not
primarily used for residential and/or commercial purposes and the current level of taxation is a material
factor which threatens the continued existence of the structure, necessitating either its demolition or
remodeling in a manner which destroys the historical or architectural value. If, after taxes on such
structure have been abated under the terms of this article, such structure is demolished or remodeled
in a way which destroys its architectural or historical value, the then owner shall pay to the municipality
an amount equal to the total amount of taxes which had been abated under the provisions of this
article.

and/or to reducing membership dues if such owner is a fraternal or philanthropic organization.
Each such abatement contract shall further:
Specify the effective date of any such abatement;

estimated completion date as specified in the Long Term Mining and
Reclamation Plan submitted pursuant to Section 5.5.7; and
E. All reclamation activities required by any previous permit have been
completed to the Commission’s satisfaction.
5.5.6 Suspension, Revocation, Transfer, or Extension of Permit: A permit issued under these
Regulations may be suspended, revoked, transferred or extended as set forth below.
5.5.6.1 Failure to Work: The failure of any permittee to actively work the permit area
for a period of six months (excluding the months of November, December,
January, February and March) without the prior written approval of the
Commission, shall be cause for revocation of a permit. Such revocation shall
become effective 30 days after the mailing of notice to the permittee and owner,
unless the permittee sooner proves to the Commission that the area has been
actively worked during such six-month period, or provides written assurances
42 | P a g e
satisfactory to the Commission that work will be resumed and continued. The
failure of the permittee thereafter to actively work the area in accordance with
such written assurance shall be grounds for revocation without further notice.
5.5.6.2 Violations of Regulations: Any permit issued under these Earth Material
Regulations may be suspended or revoked by the ZEO or the Commission when
there has been a violation of any provision of these Regulations or any permit
issued there under, provided that notice of said violation has been given to the
permittee together with an order to comply therewith within 21 working days as
set forth in said order, and the permittee has failed to comply with said order.
Such permit shall be reinstated upon demonstration of compliance to the
Commission’s satisfaction and after submittal of all materials required for an
initial permit application under Section 5.5.5 of these Regulations as determined
necessary by the Commission. Upon revocation of a permit, restoration of the
entire premises in accordance with Section 7.9.17 of these Regulations shall
begin within 90 days of such revocation and proceed on the schedule included
in the original conditions of approval.
5.5.6.3 Transfer of Permit: Any permit issued under these Regulations may be
transferred only after approval by the Commission, which may require submittal
of any or all of the information required for permit applications, including a
revised Long Term Mining and Reclamation Plan, before approval of any
transfer.
5.5.6.4 Extension of Permit: If the Commission is unable for good cause to act on a
pending permit renewal application within the time limits prescribed by
Connecticut General Statutes for Zoning Special Permit hearings, the
Commission may grant an extension of the Earth Materials Permit currently in
effect for up to two additional 30 day periods, provided there are no pending
enforcement actions or violations of any permits issued by the Town of
Woodbury.
5.5.7 Long Term Mining and Reclamation Plans for Earth Excavation District Premises: No
application for an Earth Materials Permit shall be accepted by the Commission unless a
Long Term Mining and Reclamation Plan has been submitted as provided in this Section.
Commencing September 15, 2003 and subsequently every six (6) years on September
15, any holder of a permit for earth excavation on premises within an Earth Excavation
district shall submit a Long Term Mining and Reclamation Plan for such premises
containing the following information:
A. Estimates of remaining amounts of earth materials subject to removal, including
results of boring tests conducted in a grid pattern determined by the Commission

all costs of actions covered by the bond, and the permittee does not complete
such actions to the satisfaction of the Commission, the permittee shall remain
liable for the costs in excess of the performance bond and such excess costs shall
become a lien against the premises.
5.5.8.4 Bond Forfeiture: If the Commission, after providing written notice to the
permittee, and an opportunity to be heard, finds that the permittee has violated
these Zoning Regulations and/or permit conditions, and has failed to cure such
violations within the time established by the Commission, then the Commission
may determine that the permittee’s bond shall be forfeited; whereupon the Town
of Woodbury shall be authorized to enter on the property to take all action
necessary to cure any such violation and to expend bond funds for such action.
Any excess of the amounts paid over, after deduction of all disbursements
required to abate the violation, shall be returned to the permittee.
5.5.8.5 Bond Release: Upon completion of the work authorized by a permit and the
restoration of the premises pursuant to these Earth Materials Regulations, the
permittee may file with the Commission an application for a return of the
permittee’s bond, together with a written statement from the Tax Collector of
the Town of Woodbury certifying that all taxes levied against the premises and
the machinery, equipment, and vehicles used or located thereon, and subject to
assessment in the Town of Woodbury, have been paid in full. If the Commission

Section 6. Uses in Overlay Districts
6.1 FP - Flood Plain District
6.1.1 The Flood Plain District is a class of district in addition to and overlapping one or more
of the other districts delineated on the Zoning Map of the Town of Woodbury as may be
revised from time to time. The boundaries of the Flood Plain District shall be coterminus
with boundaries of the areas of Special Flood Hazard, as identified on map(s)
entitled “Flood Insurance Rate Map, Town of Woodbury, Connecticut, Community
Panel Number 090133 0001A and 0002B, effective January 5, 1978 and October 20,
1978,” respectively, and in the report entitled “Flood Insurance Study, Town of
Woodbury, Connecticut, Litchfield County, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Federal Insurance Administration,” which are on file in the Land Use
Office and the Office of the Town Clerk. Such maps and study, together with
accompanying floodway maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto, are
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these Regulations. In any Flood Plain
District, no land, building or other structure shall be used, no building or other structure
shall be constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, extended, moved or structurally altered
and no land should be filled, graded or excavated except in accordance with this section.
6.1.2 In the delineation of the Flood Plain District, it is recognized that there are areas in the
Town of Woodbury which are themselves, or which are surrounded by areas, that are
subject to potential, periodic, or frequent flooding and which function as part of the
natural drainage system of the Town. In order to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of Woodbury residents and to minimize public and private losses due to
flooding, it is necessary to place strict limitations on (i) the use of land, buildings and
other structures within the flood plain, and (ii) the filling, grading or excavation of flood
plain lands. Accordingly, the regulations in this section are designed to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are determined to be dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to erosion, flood heights or flood water velocities;
B. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding;
C. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
D. Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels and natural
protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
E. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage;
F. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will divert flood waters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
G. Recognize that some flood plain areas serve a valuable conservation function
which should not be disrupted unless the Commission determines that such areas
can be used without creating a danger to the public health, safety and property
values; and
H. Ensure that those who own or occupy areas within the flood plain assume
responsibility for their actions.
47 | P a g e
6.1.3 For the purpose of this section, certain terms, words and phrases shall, whenever used in
this section, have the following meanings:
A. Base Flood: The 100-year flood, the flood having a 1% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year.
B. Base Flood Elevation: The elevation of the 100-year flood shall be known as the
base flood elevation as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service indicated in the “Flood Insurance Study” for the
Town of Woodbury, dated February 1976, and any revisions thereto.
C. Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations located within the special flood
hazard area.

which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the 100-year and 500-
year flood boundaries.
E. Flood Insurance Rate Map: An official map of the Town of Woodbury on which
the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of special flood
hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the Town, as well as base flood
elevations at selected locations.
F. Flood Insurance Study: The official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the
base flood and includes the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and Flood
Insurance Rate Map.
G. Flood Plain District: A zoning district, constituting the areas of special flood
hazard delineated by the Federal Insurance Administrator on the Flood Insurance
Rate Maps dated January 5, 1978 and October 20, 1978 or any revision thereto.
The Flood Plain District is indicated on the official “Zoning Map” of the Town of
Woodbury, Connecticut.
H. Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
I. Special Flood Hazard Area: The land that is in the flood plain of a community
and subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The Special
Flood Hazard Area includes all zones A and A1 - A30 as designated on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map, and all lands within the Flood Plain Zone.
J. Substantial Improvement: Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure (as determined by the cost approach to value) either: 1) before the
improvement or repair is started, or 2) if the structure has been damaged and is
being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition
“substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does
not, however, include either: 1) any project for improvement of a structure to
comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or 2) any alteration of
a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory

improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P.L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement, and means that date the Building Permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement
of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a
site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways;
nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers and foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure.
N. Water Surface Elevation: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or river line areas.
O. Manufactured Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park
trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180
consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
6.1.4 In the Flood Plain District, no building shall be constructed, reconstructed, enlarged,

for any purpose until a Flood Plain Permit has been granted by the Zoning Commission
after the applicant has demonstrated compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.1
and other applicable provisions of the Woodbury Zoning Regulations. The Commission
may hold a public hearing on any Flood Plain Permit application when deemed
necessary, or in conjunction with any other required public hearing for any other permit
required by these Regulations.
6.1.5 The Site Plan, prepared in accordance with Section 8 of these Regulations, for any use,
building or other structures and permanent equipment and any filling, grading or
excavation of land within the Flood Plain District shall be approved by the Zoning
Commission when it determines that all of the appropriate standards of this Section are
satisfied, to include the following:
A. All buildings and structures shall be:
i. designed with minimal flood damage potential;
ii. constructed and placed on a lot so as to offer the minimum resistance to the
flow of flood waters;
49 | P a g e
iii. firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effect of buoyancy;
iv. constructed with materials resistant to flood damage and by methods and
practices that minimize flood damage.
B. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other
service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from

the flood waters; and
F. The proposed use, buildings and other structures, and any filling, grading or
excavation of land for any purpose shall not increase the potential for flooding on
the lot or on any other lot and shall not otherwise endanger the public health or
safety or property.
6.1.7 Within Zones A1-A30, AE, AH and all other areas where base flood elevations are
available, the following standards shall be met prior to the issuance of any permits for
any proposed construction/development:
A. Residential Construction: New construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least
to the base flood elevation.
B. Service Facilities such as utilities shall either be constructed at or above the base
flood elevation or be structurally flood proofed.
C. Non-Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement of
any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure shall either:
i. have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the level of the base
flood elevation, or
ii. together with attendant utility services, shall:
a) Be flood proofed so that below the base flood elevation, the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;
b) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
50 | P a g e
c) Require that a registered professional engineer or architect shall
review and/or develop structural design specifications, and plans for
construction, and shall certify to the Commission that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards
of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection.
D. Elevated Buildings: New construction or substantial improvements of elevated
buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living
space below base flood elevations; and to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
i. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a
professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
a) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade; and,
c) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
ii. Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited below one
foot above the base flood elevation.
iii. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for
parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
E. Manufactured Homes:
i. All manufactured homes (including trailers placed on a site for 180
consecutive days or longer) to be placed, or substantially improved, shall be
elevated so that the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation.
ii. Each such home shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is
securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it
will resist flotation, lateral movement, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-thetop
or frame ties to ground anchors.
iii. Each such home shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage.
a) Adequate access and drainage shall be provided.
b) Elevation construction standards include, piling foundations placed no
more than 10 feet apart, and reinforcement is provided.
F. Construction Below Base Flood Elevation: Non-supporting breakaway
wall, lattice work or mesh screening shall be allowed below the base flood
elevation provided it is not part of the structural support of the building and
is designed so as to break away during flood conditions without damage to
the structural integrity of the building on which it is to be used.
G. Floodways: In A-Zones where base flood elevations have been determined,
but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial
51 | P a g e
improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which
would increase base flood elevations more than one foot at any point along
the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered
cumulatively with the proposed development. In areas where floodways
have been designated or determined, all encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements to existing structures and other
developments within the floodway, shall be prohibited.
When utilizing data other than that provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the following standard applies: select and
adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for
the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than
one foot at any one point.
H. Compensatory Storage: Neither the water holding nor conveyance capacity
of the floodplain shall be reduced. Any potential reduction as a result of
filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase
in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or
widening of the floodplain. Compensatory storage shall be provided on-site,
unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall
be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously
used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and
incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each
elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be
displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have
an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body.
Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the
Commission.
I. Equal Conveyance: Within the floodplain as designated on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the Town of Woodbury, encroachments
resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements
involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the
applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer
demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such
encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels
(base flood elevation). Work within the flood plain and the land adjacent to
the flood plain, including work to provide compensatory storage, shall not
be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or
flood velocity.
6.1.8 A Flood Plain Permit, in addition to or in conjunction with other permits required by
local, state or federal agencies, shall be obtained from the Commission prior to
development or construction in the Flood Plain District. When base flood elevation data
or floodway data have not been provided, then the Building Official or Town Planner
shall obtain from the applicant, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation
and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in order to administer
the provisions of these Regulations.

stocking levels, and timber volumes that exist in Connecticut woodlands, there is a
variety of methods that can be used, either singly or in a combination, in harvesting and
reforestation to meet the stated purpose. These methods include: clear-cutting with
natural reproduction; direct seeding or planting; seed-tree cutting; selection cutting,
including diameter limit harvesting; shelterwood cutting; and such other methods as
shall be consistent with good forestry practice.
7.7.4.1 Clear Cutting: Although even-age management is an accepted silvicultural
practice, particularly with hardwood species, its use should be practiced
judiciously. A clear-cut area presents a severe visual impact to those unfamiliar
with this harvest method; therefore, clear-cutting shall have the following
restrictions:
A. Maximum of five acres in size, not renewable for a period of three years.
In instances of severe insect infestation or disease more extensive clearcutting
may be approved by the Commission. In such instances, the
84 | P a g e
Commission shall require certification of the existence of the disease or
insect infestation by a consulting forester registered by the State Board of
Registration for Foresters.
B. Irregular in shape; avoid linear cutting bounds.
C. Soften edges by partial cutting within 50 to 100 feet of clear-cut boundaries.
D. Screen clear-cut areas with border strips along roads, trails, or other areas
of heavy public use.
E. No clear-cutting on ridge tops; these areas are the most visible.
E. In most cases even aged management may be accomplished through
shelterwood cuttings rather than clear-cutting.
7.7.5 Bonding: The applicant shall post a bond in compliance with Section 9.5.

and any necessary permits have been issued by the Woodbury Inland Wetlands and
Watercourses Agency.
7.8.6 Final restored slopes shall be graded to at least three feet horizontal to one foot vertical
unless steeper grades are expressly approved as part of a site plan. No slopes in excess
of one foot vertical to two feet horizontal shall be created by excavation or deposition
unless the site plan shows sufficient soil stockpiles to create final slopes of one foot
vertical to three feet horizontal. No excavation shall be made lower than three feet above
ledge or such greater distance above ledge as may be required to permit the re-graded
site to meet the final restored grades.
86 | P a g e
7.8.7 No excavation, deposition, or processing activities shall take place after 6:00 PM or
before 7:00 AM.

7.8.10 The Commission may require evidence of liability insurance naming the Town of
Woodbury as an additional insured for any liability resulting from the permitted
operations.
7.8.11 A Special Permit issued pursuant to this Section shall be valid for a period of two years
and may be renewed upon re-submittal of a site plan application representing current
conditions. The Commission may require a public hearing on any renewal application if
it determines that there has been a significant change in circumstances.
7.8.12 Violation of these standards or of any conditions of approval of a Special Permit pursuant
to these Regulations shall result in enforcement action in accordance with Connecticut
General Statutes Section 8-12, as determined appropriate by the Commission or the
ZEO.

7.9.4 Relationship of Permit Area to Existing Features: No excavation or fill shall be made
that would reduce the final elevation below flood plain, change the area of the flood
plain, or expose ground water without specific prior approval of the Commission, which
shall be given only when by proper analysis it is determined that no pollution or silting
of existing water courses or increased flood or erosion hazards, or other effect on water
supply or purity will result and any necessary permits have been issued by the Woodbury
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency. Within any rock quarry, to the greatest
extent practical, any quarrying of rock which will affect existing ridge lines or create
temporary exposed cliffs or create other permanent topographical features shall be done
in a manner or adequately mitigated to assure compatibility with the Plan of
Conservation and Development for the Town of Woodbury, as determined by the
Commission. Any earth material excavation permitted by these Regulations shall, to the
greatest extent possible, be done in a manner or adequately mitigated to preserve historic

spillage or repairing any damage to a road or roads of the Town of Woodbury caused by
improper loading or securing of loads.
7.9.17 Restoration of Excavated Areas: All reclamation and restoration approved as a condition
of any permit shall be completed within the permit period. The rest of the premises,
including the permit area, except for the storage area, processing area and circulation
routes, shall remain either undisturbed land or shall be graded to the proposed final
contours and elevations and be otherwise restored, seasonal planting factors considered,
pursuant to the Long-Term Mining and Reclamation Plan. Within 90 days (excluding
from said period the months of November, December, January, February and March) of
the completion of the work authorized or the expiration or revocation of the permit,
whether initial or renewed, the area of excavation, deposition, or disturbed ground shall
be restored in accordance with the Long Term Mining and Reclamation Plan and the
following standards, which may be waived or modified for good cause by a two-thirds
votes of the Commission.
7.9.17.1 Finished Slopes: Reclamation areas shall be refilled, if necessary, with earth
materials. Re-grading shall be to the final contours and elevations shown in
the approved plans with slopes (measured from final lower elevation to final
upper excavated elevation), not to exceed an average of one foot vertical in
three feet horizontal or to such a lesser slope necessary for soil stability, safety
of reasonable reuse, and development of the land but yet with sufficient grade
to ensure adequate drainage, and sufficient diversity in land form to provide a
more natural condition. Re-grading may include terracing or shelving and the
development of vertical rock faces as determined appropriate by the
Commission. Rolling topography should be developed and sloped areas shall
90 | P a g e
not exceed two hundred (200) feet of continuous length (measured
perpendicularly to the contours) without a reverse bench or terrace, a change
in grade (per cent of slope) or change in aspect (slope direction). Compaction
of fill materials shall be based on calculations developed by a qualified
engineer.
7.9.17.2 Drainage Swales: Adequate drainage swales of gradual contour shall be
provided as needed to create positive flow. Minor depressions or detention
areas may be developed to create diversity in landscape form and for storm
water management purposes as deemed appropriate by the Commission.
7.9.17.3 Debris Removal: All loose boulders of less than 10 cubic yards and all debris
shall be buried or removed from the site. Within any rock quarry, upon
completion of the work in a specific area authorized by a permit, all natural
debris and loose rock shall be buried or removed from the site.
7.9.17.4 Vegetation Restoration: A layer of arable topsoil which shall be substantially
free of stones shall be spread evenly over the entire area to a minimum depth
of six inches over reclaimed substrate or to a depth determined by the
Commission to be necessary to support vegetation growth over natural
substrate. Such cover soils shall be non-compressed and then fertilized, limed
and seeded with a perennial grass/ground cover and maintained until the
ground shall be stabilized with a dense cover in accordance with the provisions
hereunder specified and until there exists no danger of erosion as determined
by the Commission or ZEO. Restoration shall be done in accordance with the
following:
i. The amount of fertilizer and lime to be applied shall be determined by
the soil test prepared and/or approved by the U.S.D.A. Natural
Resource Conservation Service.
ii. Grass/ground cover seed used shall be fresh and be in conformance
with soil testing determinations with respect to liming, fertilizing, and
watering. Seed composition and the application rate shall be based on
sieve analysis and soil testing as performed by the permittee at a
certified testing lab. Seeding shall be done as recommended by the
seed manufacturer.
iii. Areas specifically proposed to include trees as a part of the restoration
plan shall provide a minimum of two and one-half (2 ½) feet of earth
material from the proposed grade to the ledge. Tree restoration shall
include a combination of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrub
species and shall identify the number, species type, size (height and
caliper) and general locations of the planting. The plan shall also
include a management plan narrative for general maintenance
purposes including fertilizer type and application rate, liming rate,
mulching, and a watering and pruning schedule.
iv. Trees to be used in restoration shall be young trees indigenous to the
area. Size of the trees, planting density, and species type shall be
approved by the Commission.
v. Soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions meeting the
requirements of Section 7.6 of the Woodbury Zoning Regulations
shall be incorporated in all restoration projects.
vi. Repairs: If the seeding or planting fails in whole or in part, the area
shall be re-seeded, replanted and re-mulched until all eroded or
uncovered areas have been re-seeded and repaired to the satisfaction
of the Commission.
91 | P a g e
7.9.18 Restoration Adjacent to Water Bodies: Areas shown as existing or proposed water
bodies on the approved plans shall be considered restored when and to the extent that
they have been excavated to the approved depth and all shore lines, other than those
remaining within the permit area, have been re-graded to a slope not exceeding one foot
vertical and two feet horizontal, and have been stabilized to the satisfaction of the
Commission.
7.9.19 Failure to Work and Restore Site: The failure of a permittee, without the prior written
approval of the Commission, to actively work the area covered by the permit for a period
of six months (excluding the months of November, December, January, February and
March) shall be prima facie evidence that the work authorized by the permit has been
completed, and the burden shall be upon the permittee to prove to the contrary. Any
failure to initiate restoration within the 90-day period following completion, expiration
or revocation of the permit, such as to reasonably assure complete restoration by the end
of said 90-day period (seasonal planting excepted) shall be a separate violation of these
Regulations.
7.9.20 Blasting: Any blasting permitted in conjunction with a permit or renewal permit for a
rock quarry shall comport with the following performance standards and procedures in
addition to any other blasting performance standards or procedures the Commission may
impose as conditions, based on specific permit application information, of any permit
issued under these Earth Materials Regulations.
A. Performance Standards:
i. permittee shall plan all blasting in accordance with a plan for
monitoring weather conditions approved by the Commission.
ii. blasting vibration shall be governed by a maximum resultant peak
particle velocity of 0.5 inches per second in the earth for frequencies
under 30 hertz, 1.0 inch per second in the earth for frequencies of 30
to 40 hertz, and 2.0 inches per second for frequencies over 40 hertz,
as measured at any occupied structure off the premises and not owned
by the applicant;
iii. the peak over-pressure (noise) from any blast shall be governed by a
maximum of 0.0092 pounds per square inch (130 decibels) at any
occupied structure off the premises and not owned by the applicant;
and
iv. compliance with the above standards shall be confirmed by a
continuous Seismic Monitoring Program and such other studies and
analyses that the Commission determines necessary.
B. Blasting Notice, Monitoring, and Damage Complaint Procedures.
i. Permittee shall provide the Land Use Office with notification at least
24 hours prior to any anticipated production blast and shall notify
other individuals requesting such notification of a production blast.
ii. All production and test blasts shall be monitored with air pressure,
seismic, and decibel meters at no fewer than five (5) sites for each
blast.
iii. Permittee shall notify in writing any property owner who has filed a
complaint pursuant to Section 7.9.22 of these Earth Materials
Regulations of the availability of a pre-blast survey and how to request
same. Upon such request, permittee shall conduct or arrange for a preblast
survey that shall determine the condition of the dwelling or
92 | P a g e
structure and document any existing damage and other physical
factors that could reasonably be affected by the blasting. A written
report of the survey shall be prepared and signed by the person who
conducted the survey. A copy of the report shall be provided to the
property owner requesting the survey. In the event that a permittee
believes that a property owner is remote in location from any Earth
Excavation District and is using this procedure in a manner
inconsistent with the intent of these Regulations, the Commission may
waive the requirement that the permittee provide a pre-blast survey to
such property owner.
iv. Permittee shall assume all costs of repair/replacement due to damages
to any structures and/or wells located within one-half (1/2) mile of an
Earth Excavation district for which a permit has been issued or if such
structure was surveyed pursuant to Section 7.9.20.B.iii, above, and if
it is determined by a registered professional engineer selected by the
homeowner from a list compiled by the Commission and approved by
the permittee that in the engineer’s professional opinion it is more
probable than not that the damage to the structure or well was caused
by blasting conducted in accordance with such permit. Permittee shall
also pay for the cost of the engineering study.
7.9.21 Operations and Compliance Monitoring: If required as a condition of any permit issued
under these Earth Materials Regulations, a permittee shall submit reports which shall

8.2 Special Permit Application Procedures
In dividing the Town of Woodbury into Zoning Districts, it is recognized that there are certain uses
which may be necessary or desirable to the Town, but which may be detrimental to the Town or
the neighborhood in certain locations, or if proper safeguards are not provided. The Zoning
Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals, as the case may be, must
evaluate the impact of each proposed use upon neighboring uses and the Town as a whole in
determining the appropriateness of any use requiring a Special Permit for the proposed location.
Where any use or development application requires more than one Special Permit pursuant to these
Regulations, the application may be consolidated into a single application for the purposes of all
notices, hearings, and decisions required by these Regulations and Connecticut General Statutes.
8.2.1 Within 65 days of the Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the
Zoning Board of Appeals granting of any Special Permit, the applicant shall submit
the final site plan on recordable mylar, reflecting all conditions and modifications
required by the Commission, and accompanied by signed and sealed statement by
the appropriate design professional(s) who have prepared the application materials,
to the effect that the plans submitted are the same plans as granted by the
Commission, except for the depiction of modifications and conditions required by
the Commission in its approval vote. Any Special Permit site plan filed in the Town
Clerk's Office without the endorsement of the Commission's or Board’s Chairman
shall be void.
8.2.2 In accordance with Section 8-3(d) of the Connecticut General Statutes, no variance,
or Special Permit issued in accordance with these Regulations shall be effective
until a copy thereof, including any plans required by Section 8.2.1 of these
Regulations, certified by the Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or
the Zoning Board of Appeals, as the case may be, containing a description of the
premises to which it relates and specifying the nature of such variance, or Special
Permit, including the Regulation which is varied in its application or to which a
Special Permit is granted, and stating the name of the owner of record, is recorded
in the land records of the Town of Woodbury.
8.2.3 No person who has obtained a Special Permit, Site Plan Approval, or variance shall
attempt to erect any building or structure, or establish any use of land, which is not
in substantial conformance with any element of the plans, descriptions, applications
and supporting materials, information, specifications submitted, or any
representations of fact made, before the Zoning Commission, Planning
Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals, as the case may be, without an
amendment as provided in these Regulations.
8.2.4 No person who has obtained a Special Permit, Site Plan Approval, or variance shall
violate any condition imposed thereon. Violation of this provision shall be grounds
for the Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of
Appeals, as the case may be, to take legal action as may be required to secure
compliance with said Special Permit or variance and the conditions attached
thereto.
8.2.5 Failure to strictly comply with the terms and conditions of the approval granted by
the Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, or Zoning Board of Appeals as a
part of the Special Permit shall be a violation of these Regulations. The ZEO shall
notify the applicant in writing of the specifics of the non-compliance and shall
106 | P a g e
provide a reasonable time period for compliance therewith, not to exceed forty-five
(45) days. Unless there is a full compliance within such time period, the Zoning
Commission, Planning Commission, and/or Zoning Board of Appeals, in addition
to any other remedies at law, may, after providing at least seven (7) days prior
written notice and an opportunity to be heard to the violator, rescind and revoke
such Special Permit.
8.2.6 The Zoning Commission or Planning Commission may authorize the ZEO to
authorize minor, non-substantial deviations from the approved Special Permits and
Site Plan Approvals. Likewise, the Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize the
ZEO to authorize minor, non-substantial deviations from approved variances.
8.2.7 Substantial changes to a Special Permit, Site Plan Approval, or variance shall be
treated as a new application for approval, and shall be submitted and acted upon in
accordance with these Regulations.
8.2.8 An approved Special Permit may be amended or modified, provided that
application shall be made in the same manner as the original application and subject
to the same procedures for approval. Amendments to the Special Permit found to
be of a minor nature or which would not substantially alter the Special Permit as
determined by the ZEO may be approved by the Zoning Commission, Planning
Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals without another public hearing.
Amendments to Special Permits which would substantially alter the Special Permit
granted or increase the existing building coverage or gross floor area of the use by
10% or more may be approved by the Zoning Commission, Planning Commission,
and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals only after a public hearing.
8.2.9 The Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of
Appeals may by resolution waive the submission of all or part of the information
required under the applicable clauses of Sections 8.5 and this Section 8.2 if it finds
the information is not necessary in order to decide on any application for change of
use.
8.2.10 The Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of
Appeals may waive the requirement for a Special Permit where it finds that:

lot;
B. the new use will require no greater parking or loading than the original, as set
forth in Section 7.4 of these Regulations;
C. the new use shall entail no exterior change to the building or site; and
D. the new use shall have no impact on the site, neighborhood, or the Town which
is different from the original, such impact to be measured by the standards set
forth in Section 8.3 of these Regulations.
8.2.11 The Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of
Appeals may grant a written request for waiver of the submission of any of the site
plan filing requirements if all of the following requirements are met:
A. The use will not increase the amount of required parking;
B. The use will not have a substantial impact on properties in the surrounding
neighborhood by elements including, but not limited to: noise, traffic,
107 | P a g e
environmental quality, character of use, and compatibility with surrounding
uses;
C. The use will not substantially alter the nature of the existing building(s) or other
structure(s); and
D. The use will not be inconsistent with the public welfare or impair the integrity
of these Regulations.
8.2.12 Expiration, Extension, and Enforcement of Approval of Special Permit
A. Except in the case of Special Permits approved for staged development under
Section 5.4, 6.3, and 6.4, if a building or use for which a Special Permit is
required is not completed and/or used within five years after an application is
approved, such approval shall expire and become void. The five-year period
shall commence on the date of Zoning Commission, Planning Commission,
and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals approval. In addition, the approval shall be
filed on the Woodbury land records by the applicant.
B. In the case of Special Permits providing for staged development, if the first stage
of the development is not completed within two years after an application is
approved, such approval shall expire and become void. Subsequent stages of
development shall be completed by the expiration date established by the
Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of
Appeals in its approval; if any non-dwelling unit construction stage, is not
completed by the applicable expiration date, the Zoning Commission, Planning
Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals may suspend the applicant
from further construction of dwelling units until compliance with the
development phasing sequence is achieved; if all dwelling unit construction is
not completed by the final expiration date, then such approval shall expire and
become void as to the balance of the stages.
C. The Zoning Commission, Planning Commission, and/or the Zoning Board of
Appeals may, in its discretion, on application made before the date any approval
expires, extend the expiration date of such Special Permit approval for an
additional period of up to two years if it finds that the standards of Section 8.3
continue to be met with respect to the proposed development.
C-1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any site plan approval
made under this section prior to July 1, 2011, that has not expired prior
to the effective date of this section, except an approval of any site plan
for a project consisting of four hundred or more dwelling units approved
on or after June 19, 1987, shall expire not less than nine years after the
date of such approval and the commission may grant one or more
extensions of time to complete all or part of the work in connection with
such site plan, provided no approval, including all extensions, shall be
valid for more than fourteen years from the date the site plan was
approved.
D. Substantial changes to a Special Permit shall be treated as a new application for
approval and shall be submitted and acted upon in accordance with these
Regulations.

9.3.1 Zoning Enforcement Officer(s) ZEO(s): These Regulations shall be administered and
enforced by such ZEO or Officers as the Commission shall, by resolution, designate.
ZEO’s shall be employees of the Town of Woodbury. Designation of a ZEO by the
Zoning Commission shall remain in effect for a maximum period of two years and shall
automatically expire upon the individual leaving employment by the Town of
Woodbury. Candidates for ZEO shall be submitted to the Zoning Commission for
designation or re-designation by the First Selectman of the Town of Woodbury no less
than 6 weeks prior to the expiration of such authority.
9.3.2 Enforcement: These Regulations shall be enforced by designated ZEO(s), subject to
supervision and direction by the Zoning Commission, who is (are) empowered to cause
any building, other structure, place, or premises to be inspected and examined and to
order, in writing, the remedying of any conditions found to exist there in violation of any
provision of these Regulations, or any permit or approval issued hereunder.
9.3.3 A. Possible Violation: Upon first becoming aware that a violation of these regulations
may exist, it is the duty and responsibility of the ZEO(s) to review the facts and verify
the violation. The ZEO will then issue a verbal and/or written notification of the facts of
the possible violation to the individual property owner, tenant or other person(s)
responsible for the violation taking place. As part of this communication, the ZEO will
inform the individual property owner, tenant, or other person(s) responsible that the
117 | P a g e
possible violation will be listed under Enforcement at the next Zoning Commission
meeting, and will provide the date, time and location of the meeting. Details of this
communication will be recorded in the property files at the land use office and will be
forwarded to the Commission Clerk for inclusion on the next agenda.
B. The ZEO will determine the priority of possible zoning
enforcement actions and deal with them accordingly as follows:
i. Possible violations that pose immediate danger to the
public health, safety and general welfare of the community.
ii. Possible violations related to grading of land, the
removal of earth or soil erosion and sediment control.

ZEO as to enforcement. Should the Commission determine to move forward with
enforcement, the ZEO, upon instruction from the Commission, will issue a Notice of
Violation and Request for Voluntary Compliance. The ZEO will initiate dialogue and/or
notify the individual property owner, tenant or other person(s) responsible in writing of
the violation and request voluntary compliance. If the alleged violator is not the owner,
a Notice of Violation should be sent to both the owner and the tenant/renter/lessee.
If the violation involves the grading of land, removal of earth or soil erosion and
sediment control, or is determined to be an emergency or egregious in nature, a Cease
and Desist Order may be issued (to be effective immediately) instead of a Notice of
Violation. In such instances, the ZEO may issue such Order and then bring notice to the
Commission at its next regular meeting.
9.3.5 Follow up Inspection: The Notice of Violation shall include a grace period, determined
by the Zoning Commission, to allow voluntary compliance, depending on the severity
of the violation. Public health, safety and welfare shall guide the Commission’s decision
regarding the length of the grace period.
9.3.6 Upon expiration of the grace period, the ZEO will conduct a follow up inspection to
determine if compliance has been achieved. If substantial progress has been made
toward correction of the violation, the Commission may extend the grace period for up
to an additional 30 days.
9.3.7 Cease and Desist Order: If the first or second follow up inspection reveals that the
property is still in violation, or if the violation and violator represent a persistent
violation, the Commission may instruct the ZEO to issue a Cease and Desist Order,
If the violation involves the grading of land, removal of earth or soil erosion and sediment
control, or is determined to be an emergency or egregious in nature, the Cease and Desist
118 | P a g e
Order shall require the violation to be corrected immediately. For all other violations,
the Commission shall provide the violator with no more than 30 days to correct the
violation. This is an order to correct the zoning violation.
9.3.8 Notice of Violation: Following the issuance of a cease and desist order or order to
remedy a zoning violation by the ZEO, and the subsequent failure of the individual
property owner, tenant or other person(s) responsible, as the case may be, to comply
with such order, unless any such order has been appealed to, and overturned by, the
Zoning Board of Appeals:
A. The ZEO or other authorized municipal agent shall place the intent to file a Notice
of Zoning Violation on the agenda of the Zoning Commission.
B. The ZEO or other authorized municipal agent shall file the Notice of Zoning
Violation on the Woodbury Land Records.
C. Once any violation has been corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning Commission
and all fines or penalties been paid in full, the ZEO shall file a Notice of Release
Zoning Violation on the Woodbury Land Records.
9.3.9 Penalties: The owner or agent of a building, other structure, or property where such
violation shall have been committed or shall exist, or the lessee or tenant of an entire
building or an entire lot where such violation shall have been committed or shall exist

direct Town Counsel to commence criminal or civil action in State or Federal court for
the purpose of enforcing the provisions of these Regulations.

where it is alleged that there is an error in the order, requirements, decision or
determination of the ZEO (ZEO). No question of hardship shall be involved in

regulations would result in exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship so that
substantial justice will be done and the public safety and welfare secured. The

considerations alone or hardship created by willful act of the property owner are

with Section 9.6.2, below, of these Regulations, the ZBA shall have the authority
to issue a Special Permit for the change of a non-conforming use, as defined in
Section 1.4.4, to another non-conforming use, upon finding that the proposed
change:

B. Is not materially different from the established use, or likely to have more
significant impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and will result in the
subject property being maintained as well or better;

change in
i. the character of any structure,

sufficient detail to describe the proposal,
C. Documentation of intent to continue a non-conforming use, and

exception be made for a matter of public safety, the Fire Marshal or the Building Official
is given authority to order the demolition of a building or structure without obtaining a

5.6 A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required prior to the installation of any additional
lighting apparatus to a new or existing building, structure or sign which is used in

5
SECTION 6 -APPLICATIONS, HEARINGS AND DECISIONS
6.1 Applications: An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness or a Variance shall be
submitted on the form prescribed by the Commission to the Town Planning Office. All
applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness or a Variance require a public hearing,
including applications for signs, fences, lighting, non-residential driveways and parking
areas, exterior architectural alterations of existing buildings or structures, the demolition or
removal of existing buildings or structures, and the construction of new buildings and
structures.
6.2 Fees:
6.2.1 An application fee of $50 must accompany each application or request for
variance. There is no fee for determinations of exceptions.
6.2.2 If the Commission determines that it is necessary to obtain specialized review to
fully and properly review and evaluate the application, the fees for such expertise
shall be paid by the applicant within ten (10) days of the Town’s written notice of
the actual or estimated fees.
6.2.3 Failure of an applicant to submit all required fees shall be sufficient grounds for
denial of the application.
6.3 Hearings:
6.3.1 The Commission shall hold a public hearing on all applications for a Certificate of
Appropriateness unless the Commission determines that such application involves
items not subject to approval by the Commission. The Commission shall fix a
reasonable time and place for such hearing. Notice of the time and place of such
hearing shall be given by the Commission by publication in the form of a legal
advertisement appearing in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the
municipality at least once, not less than five days, and not more than fifteen days
before the scheduled hearing.
6.3.2 Notice of public hearings may be mailed to abutting property owners.
6.4 Decisions: In order to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission must have a
concurring vote of a majority of the Commission members. Decisions for a Certificate of
Appropriateness must be rendered within sixty-five (65) days after the filing of a completed
application with the Commission. Failure on the part of the Commission to act within the
sixty-five (65) day period shall constitute an approval and no other evidence of approval
shall be needed. In its deliberations, the Commission shall act only for the purpose of
controlling the erection, alteration or demolition of buildings, structures or parking areas
that are incongruous with the historic or architectural aspects of the district. The
Commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use. However, the Commission may
recommend adaptive reuse of any buildings or structures within the historic district
6
compatible with the historic architectural aspects of the building.
When the Commission acts upon an application, it shall submit written notice of its
decision to the applicant. Should the Commission deny a Certificate of Appropriateness,
the reasons for the denial, including the basis for its conclusion, shall be placed upon the
Commission’s records and included in the notice sent to the applicant. The notice to the
applicant may also include recommendations relative to design, arrangement, texture,
material and other similar features. The Commission is empowered with the authority to
issue a Certificate of Appropriateness with stipulations.
SECTION 7 -VARIANCES, EXEMPTIONS AND DEMOLITION DELAYS
7.1 Variances: The Commission shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to
these Regulations so as to relieve exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship as it
relates to a specific parcel of land and not generally affecting the historic district in which
the land is located; provided such variance, modification or interpretation is in harmony
with the general purposes and intent of these Regulations, so that the general character of
the historic district shall be conserved and substantial justice is done. In granting variances,
the Commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as
will, in its judgment, better fulfill the purposes of these Regulations. Any application for
such a variance must include the an explanation of the practical difficulty or undue
hardship. The Commission shall, for each variance granted, place upon its records, and in
the notice to the applicant, the reasons for its determination.
7.2 Exemptions: Certain activities that are undertaken in the historic districts are declared to
be of such a nature that they are exempt from these Regulations. Specific activities
considered exempt, upon submittal of documentation satisfactory to the Commission or its
Enforcement Officer, are:
7.2.1 Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the
districts which does not involve a change in the appearance or design thereof;
7.2.2 The erection or alteration of any feature which the Building Inspector, or similar
agent, certifies is required by public safety because of a condition that is either
unsafe or dangerous due to deterioration of the feature; and
7.2.3 Any property owned by a nonprofit institution of higher education, for so long as a
nonprofit institution of higher education owns such a property, is exempt from these
Regulations.
7.3 Demolition Delays: The Commission may delay the issuance of a demolition permit
for a structure situated in a historic district for ninety (90) days providing during such
time the Commission or the Connecticut Historical Commission is trying to find a
buyer who will retain or remove such building or who will present some reasonable
alternative to demolition.
7
SECTION 8 - CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATENESS
If the Commission determines that the proposed erection, alteration, or parking will be appropriate,
it shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness. In determining appropr iateness , the Commission
shall consider, in addition to other pertinent factors, the type and style of exterior windows, doors,
light fixtures, signs, above ground utility structures, mechanical appurtenances, and the type and
texture of building materials. The Commission shall also consider the historical and architectural
style, scale, general design, arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved
and their relationship to the architectural style and pertinent features of other buildings and
structures in the neighborhood. The Commission shall also consider the principles contained in the
United States Department of the Interior “Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.”
No application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for an exterior architectural feature, such as a
solar energy system, designed for the utilization of renewable resources, shall be denied unless the
Commission finds that the feature cannot be installed without substantially impairing the historic
character and appearance of the District. A Certificate of Appropriateness for such a feature may
include stipulations requiring design modifications and limitations on the location of the feature
that do not significantly impair its effectiveness. In determining appropriateness as to parking, the
Commission shall consider the size of such parking area, the visibility of the cars parked in that
area, the closeness of such area to adjacent buildings, and other relevant factors.
8.1 Guidelines for Construction and Alterations in the Historic District
8.1.1 Except as provided in Section 7.2 of these Regulations, the removal or alteration of
any historic materials or architectural features should be held to the minimum.
8.1.2 Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced. If
replacement is necessary, the new material should be compatible with the replaced
material in composition, design, color, texture, and other aesthetic and architectural
qualities. Repair or replacement of architectural features should be based on the
original features of the building rather than based on designs taken from other historic
buildings. Alterations that create an appearance inconsistent with the character of the
building are discouraged. Low maintenance siding, such-as aluminum or vinyl
clapboards, which are products of the mid-20th century, are by nature, inappropriate on
historic buildings.
8.1.3 Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings should be made in such a

shall be filed in the Town Planning Office no later than five days prior to the regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission. Six (6) complete sets of all required information shall be
filed, except as otherwise specified or unless the Commission approves a written request for
fewer copies. The Town Planning Office shall transmit all applications to the Commission for its
official receipt and formal consideration at its next regular meeting. The date of applications and

application shall be covered by a transmittal form or letter referencing the application title,
describing the materials and referencing applicable regulations, and providing original and
previous revision dates for any revised plans or documents filed subsequent to the original.
2.2 Informal Preliminary Review
The Commission recommends that prior to submission of a formal application for approval of a
subdivision or resubdivision, the applicant voluntarily prepare and present a preliminary plan of
the subdivision or resubdivision for an informal review by the Commission and/or staff.
Presentation of a preliminary plan is recommended to facilitate general considerations of the
factors and problems affecting the development of the land to be subdivided or resubdivided
before the applicant proceeds with a formal application and preparation of final plans.
Presentation of the preliminary plan shall not constitute "formal" application within the meaning
of Title 8, Chapter 126, of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended and the Commission's
review of said preliminary plan and its comments, if any, shall not be deemed to be the official
"action" or "decision" within the meaning of said Title and Chapter. The informal preliminary
review procedure shall in no way bind, bar or stop the Commission from taking any action it
deems fit and making any decision it deems advisable upon filing of a formal application.
2.2.1 Preliminary Sketch Plan: The preliminary subdivision or resubdivision plan
should be drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet and should
show existing and proposed property and street lines, preliminary grading and
profiles, proposed lots, and prospective open space preservation. The sketch plan
should show, or be overlain on a map showing the features on the Existing
Resources/Site Analysis Map required by Section 2.3.3, below.
2.2.2 Site Visit: Prospective applicants should arrange a site visit with the Town
Planning Office to discuss the Existing Resources/Site Analysis Map and to
identify options for preserving open space.

following:
2.3.1 Application: Application for approval of a subdivision or resubdivision shall be
made to the Commission in writing on forms prescribed by the Commission and

After the above application requirements have been met to the satisfaction of the Commission,
the following procedure shall be followed by the Commission in its formal consideration of the
application:
2.5.1 Submission Review: The Commission shall determine if an application submitted
under Section 2.3 is complete. Failure of the applicant to submit a complete
application will be cause for disapproval of the application.
2.5.2 Review of Others: The Commission shall transmit copies of the relevant maps
and plans to the Board of Selectmen and the Director of Health of the Town of
Woodbury for their review and approval as necessary. Copies may also be sent to
the Woodbury Conservation Commission, the Woodbury Fire Department, and
such other boards, agencies and commissions, and to consultants, as in the
opinion of the Commission, may be advisable, for their information, review and
recommendations.
2.5.3 Hearing: A public hearing regarding an application for approval of a subdivision
may be held by the Commission if, in its judgment, such action is required. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing on any application for a resubdivision, for
a subdivision in excess of nine (9) lots, for open space subdivisions, and for
subdivisions on properties that are proposed for open space and conservation
areas in the Woodbury Plan of Conservation and Development. Notice of any
public hearing shall be given in accordance with Section 8-26 of the Connecticut
General Statutes, as amended and as the same may, from time to time, be
amended. Notice of said public hearing shall be sent to owners of property
adjacent to the land to be subdivided. Notices are to be sent by the applicant by
certified mail, return receipt requested, at least seven (7) days in advance of any
public hearing. The applicant shall submit to the Commission at said public
hearing the certified mail receipts and a list of the owners of property adjacent to
the land to be subdivided. Whether or not a public hearing is held, every applicant
shall be afforded the opportunity to appear before the Commission to discuss the
application before final action by the Commission.
2.5.4 Decision: The Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or disapprove
any subdivision or resubdivision application or maps and plans submitted with
any such application within sixty-five (65) days after the close of the public
hearing or, if no public hearing is held, within sixty-five days after the day of
receipt of the application. If the Commission requests the submission of
additional information, under Section 2.4, such information shall be submitted
within the sixty-five (65) day period of extension thereof; otherwise, failure to
submit the requested information will be grounds for disapproval of the
application. The failure of the Commission to act on a duly submitted application
shall be considered as an approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued
by the Commission on demand, provided an extension of time not to exceed a
further period of sixty-five (65) days may be had with the consent of the
applicant. The grounds for its action shall be stated in the record of the
Commission.

1. Limit membership to one class who shall be property owners in the
subdivision or resubdivision;
2. Provide that each lot in the subdivision or resubdivision shall be entitled to
one vote regardless of the number of owners of the lot;
3. Provide the assessments against members for all expenses including, but
not limited to, maintenance of said open space land, including any
improvements thereon, taxes, and insurance;
4. Provide that each member may use the open space land, including any
improvements thereon, in accordance with the purpose for which they
were intended without hindering or encroaching upon the lawful rights of
other members; and
5. Restrict the use of said open space land to members of said corporation or
their social guests.
d. With the express approval of the Planning Commission, open space land may
be owned by each lot owner in the subdivision or resubdivision, with the
owner of said lots having an undivided interest in said open space land,
provided, however, that such open space land shall remain undivided and no
lot owner shall bring any action for partition or division of any part thereof,
and further provided that the use of such open space land shall be limited to
property owners in the subdivision or resubdivision or their social guests.

e. With the express approval of the Planning Commission, ownership of open
space land may be retained by the developer for the uses set forth in Section
4.9.9 herein, or if said open space land is subject to conservation and
preservation restrictions (within the meaning of Section 47-42a of the
Connecticut General Statutes, as amended, and as the same may, from time to
time, be amended), the terms and conditions of which are acceptable to the
Commission.
4.9.6 Guidelines for Open Space Ownership:
a. Open space parcels may be accepted by the Town when the parcel is unique or
significant or which offers opportunities for active or passive recreation for
Town residents. In such cases access to the open space shall be provided and
designed so that use of the open space does not interfere with reasonable use
by the residents of the subdivision. The Town may also consider dedication
of open space when the parcel provides a needed link in a streambelt system
or connects with other greenbelt areas.
b. Open space parcels may be conveyed to a nonstock corporation (homeowners
association) when the parcel is largely internal to the subdivision.
c. Open space parcels may be conveyed to a non-profit land conservation trust
where the parcel contains significant areas of wildlife habitats, or is adjacent
to other land owned by a non-profit land trust and/or where the addition of the
parcel may enhance existing lands owned by such a trust.
4.9.7 Payment of Fee in Lieu of Open Space: In accordance with Connecticut General
Statutes Section 8-25, as amended, the Commission in its sole discretion, may
authorize a subdivider to pay a fee and/or transfer land to the Town of Woodbury
in lieu of the preservation of open space by one of the methods set forth above.
Such authorization may be granted by the Commission after a determination that
there are inadequate areas on the subdivision which merit preservation by one of
the methods set forth in Section 4.9, or that there are other areas in the Town of
Woodbury where preservation would be more beneficial to the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that such authorization is granted by the
Commission, such payment or combination of payment and fair market value of
land transferred shall be equal to not more than ten (10) percent of the fair market
value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision. The
fair market value shall be determined by a State of Connecticut Certified
Appraiser jointly selected by the Commission and applicant. The cost of the
appraisal shall be paid by the applicant. A fraction of such payment, the
numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of
approved lots in the subdivision, shall be made at the time of the sale of each
approved lot in the subdivision and placed in an open space fund. Such fund shall
be used solely for the purpose of preserving open space, acquiring additional land
for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes. Said payment
Woodbury Connecticut Subdivision Regulations
Effective January 1, 2006 12:01 AM
39
obligation shall be secured by a lien against each lot in the subdivision, and the
lien shall be filed at the time that the final subdivision plans are filed in the Office
of the Town Clerk, in accordance with Section 2.5.11 of these Regulations. Said
lien shall be in a form approved by the Commission and Town Counsel and shall
be unencumbered by any mortgage and encumbrance having priority over said
lien, as evidenced by a Certificate of Title.
4.9.8 Conservation Easements: The Commission, in its sole discretion, may approve a
subdivision that meets some or all of the open space requirement of these
Subdivision Regulations by the provision of conservation easements in form and
content satisfactory to the Commission and as defined in Section 47-42a of the
Connecticut General Statutes, as amended. The Commission will determine that
proposed easements are of sufficient size and character to meet the criteria for
open space in Section 4.9.2. Proposed conservation easements must be submitted
with any application.
4.9.9 Use of Open Space Land: Except where otherwise approved after hearing by the
Planning Commission, open space land shall be preserved in its natural state and
the use of such land shall be limited to appropriate conservation, open space, and
recreational purposes as determined by the Planning Commission. Suitable legal
agreements, including conservation and preservation easements and restrictions,
approved in form and content by Town Counsel, may be required by the Planning
Commission. With the approval of the Planning Commission after a public
hearing held thereon, structures and facilities for recreational purposes, including
tennis courts and golf courses, may be constructed. Open space land shall not be
used for the deposit of debris and shall not be excavated, filled or regraded and
trees shall not be removed therefrom, except in accordance with a grading plan
submitted under Section 2.3.8.
4.9.10 Exemptions from Open Space Requirements. The Commission may determine
that the open space requirements of these regulations shall not apply upon a
finding that the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in
Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-39a, equal to twenty (20) percent or more
of the total housing to be provided in such subdivision or that the transfer of all
land in a proposed subdivision of less than five parcels is to a parent, child,
brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first cousin for no
consideration. The Commission may impose a requirement of a fee in lieu of
open space for any lot sold within five years of approval of a subdivision without
open space preservation as a result of an exemption claimed pursuant to this
Section. Such fee shall be applied to each lot sold and calculated as provided in
Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-25. A notice, approved by Town Counsel,
shall be placed on the land records with the filing of a record subdivision map,
which notice shall include the date of subdivision approval and specifying the
transfer of any lot within five years of approval will result in imposition of the fee
prescribed by this Section.

4.10 Street Signs
Street name signs shall be installed at all street intersections in location approved by the Board of
Selectmen. Such signs shall be of a design and material approved by the Board of Selectmen.
4.11 Monuments and Pins
Monuments shall be provided on both street right-of-way lines at the beginning and termination
of each street and at each deflection or tangent point in between. Monuments shall be made of
reinforced concrete or granite and shall be not less than four (4) inches square at the top by 30
inches of length with a suitably marked top. Each monument shall be set in place, after all street
construction is completed, with the marked point set on the point of reference and shall be
installed in a manner conforming to standards of the Connecticut Association of Land Surveyors.
4.11.1 Iron Pins: In addition to the required monuments, iron pins, not less than 3/4 inch
in diameter and 36 inches in length consisting of a suitable rod or pipe, shall be
placed (a) at each point of intersection of a lot line and the right-of-way line of a
street and (b) at all other lot corners and shall be installed in a manner conforming
to standards of the Connecticut Association of Land Surveyors. Monuments may
be substituted for iron pins. Pins, however, are not required at each change of
direction of an irregular lot line such as along the stream or stone wall.
4.12 Underground Utility Lines
New electric and telephone wires shall be installed underground unless the Commission
determines, based on a written report submitted by the applicant, that such underground
installation is inappropriate or unfeasible for all or a part of the subdivision or resubdivision. In
making such determination, the Commission shall take into account (a) the type of service
existing in the area adjacent to the subdivision, (b) topographic and construction conditions and
(c) the size of the subdivision or resubdivision. Whenever possible, such underground utilities
shall not be located under the street pavement.
4.13 Street Trees
When the Commission determines there are insufficient existing trees within the proposed
subdivision or resubdivision, it may require the planting of additional street trees. In general,
street trees shall be planted approximately 40 feet apart on both sides of any street, subject to
variations made necessary by driveways, street corners, walks and by the need to protect solar
access to the south wall of proposed buildings in locations approved by the Commission. Trees
to be planted shall be at least 1-3/4 inch diameter at three feet above grade and shall have a
minimum height of ten (10) feet. The species of trees proposed shall be deciduous with a mature
height of 50-60 feet, subject to the approval of the Commission. Where the trees may interfere
with utility poles and wires, the Commission may permit the location of required trees within the
front ten (10) feet of the proposed lots. Existing trees along the proposed street, which conform
to these requirements may be substituted for new trees at the discretion of the Commission.

4.14 Fire Protection
The Commission may, in its sole discretion, require, for fire protection, the construction of ponds
or the installation of underground storage tanks with a minimum capacity of 10,000 gallons,
including dry hydrant connections, in any subdivision or resubdivision. The pond shall be
constructed in accordance with the standards and practices of the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources
Conservation Service and shall have a minimum capacity as determined by the Commission after
consulting with the Woodbury Board of Fire Commissioners. The fire pond or underground tank
shall be accessible from the street right-of-way or via a right-of-way in favor of the Town and
said right-of-way shall have a width of 30 feet to allow emergency vehicles clear and safe entry,
free of trees, brush and other objects.
4.15 Cul-de-sacs
A cul-de-sac is a single or multiple minor rural or dead-end local rural street with a single
connection to a residential collector, residential sub-collector, or arterial street or a minor rural or
local rural street in existence prior to March 14, 1956, as those streets are defined in Section
1.3.3 of the Woodbury Street Regulations.
4.15.1 Lots: Cul-de-sacs shall be designed to serve no more than twenty-five (25)
building lots as specified in Section 3.2.9 of the Woodbury Street Regulations.
4.15.2 Turnarounds: Cul-de-sacs serving more than six building lots shall provide a
circular turnaround with a right-of-way radius of at least 55 feet and an outside
pavement radius of at least 45 feet and pavement width of 25 feet or such width as
determined by the Commission. Any such turnaround shall include a circular or
teardrop shaped island, retaining natural vegetation to the extent possible and
landscaped as required by the Commission. Cul-de-sacs serving six or fewer
building lots shall provide a circular turnaround as above or may provide a T-type
or alley turnaround sufficient to permit turnaround by emergency vehicles and
with no accessways at either end. Maximum slope for a turnaround shall be 3%.
4.15.3 Temporary Turnarounds: After giving consideration to topography, zone,
wetlands, traffic levels, lot sizes and general traffic circulation patterns, the
Commission, in its sole discretion, may approve a street that ends at the property
line of an adjacent tract of land, and such streets shall terminate in a temporary
turnaround. The area of the turnaround outside of the 50-foot right-of-way
required for a street shall be deeded to the abutting lot owners with an easement in
favor of the Town. Said easement shall remain in effect until the street is
extended at which time the easement shall be null and void. When said extension
is constructed, the developer of said extension shall remove all pavement beyond
the street right-of-way and shall landscape the area so as to blend into the adjacent
lot.

4.16 Erosion, Sediment and Runoff Control
The design and construction of the subdivision or resubdivision including related streets,
drainage, and other improvements shall be executed in a manner so that such improvements will
not cause erosion to, flood or sediment deposits on the properties being developed including
surrounding properties, wetlands or watercourses. Runoff water shall be properly channeled into
a storm drain, watercourse, ponding area, swales and infiltrators, or other suitable facility.
Measures used to control erosion, sediment, and runoff shall meet the following minimum
standards:
4.16.1 Cut slopes shall not be steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and fill slope
shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, except as approved by
the Commission when handled under special conditions. Where rock cut is
required outside of the right-of-way, a one horizontal to six vertical (1:6)
maximum slope is allowed unless the physical condition of the rock requires a
more moderate slope.
4.16.2 Adequate provision shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging the cut
face of excavation or the sloping surfaces of fills.
4.16.3 Cut and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
4.16.4 Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or erosion of the soil.
4.16.5 Fill shall not encroach on natural watercourses, wetlands, or other areas regulated
by Woodbury Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations or constructed
channels unless approved by the Woodbury Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Agency.
4.16.6 Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water onto property of
another landowner without the express written consent of that landowner and the
approval of the Commission and Inland Wetlands Agency.
4.16.7 During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control will be exercised.
4.17 Storm Drainage
4.17.1 General: The developer shall be responsible for constructing adequate facilities in
accordance with the Town's "Regulations Pertaining to the Construction and
Acceptance of Streets" for the control, collection, conveyance, acceptable
discharge of storm water, other surface water and subsurface water which may be
detrimental to the safe and convenient use of any portion of the area. The storm
drainage system shall provide for runoff from the entire area of the subdivision. It
shall take into account land outside the subdivision limits, which normally drains
across the area of the subdivision as well as the effects of the subdivision upon
downstream drainage systems. As primary focus, the drainage system for the
subdivision shall make use of, protect, and improve, as needed, the natural
drainage system. Drainage facilities shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the standards and procedures specified in these Regulations.
Woodbury Connecticut Subdivision Regulations
Effective January 1, 2006 12:01 AM
43
4.17.2 Design Storm: All storm drainage facilities shall be designed with sufficient
capacity and freeboard where necessary to convey the peak rates of runoff from
storms with the average return frequencies listed below:
10 Year - All drainage facilities within roads and easements from catch basin
grates to outlet structures, et cetera.
25 Year - All cross culverts under drives, minor rural, local rural, and residential
sub-collector streets as defined in the Woodbury Street Regulations, as well as
improved streams, swales and ditches.
50 Year - All cross culverts and bridges constructed under residential collector
and arterial streets, as defined in Woodbury Street Regulations, and where
required by the Town.
4.17.3 Storm Water Discharge: The discharge of all storm water shall be into an
established wetlands, watercourse, or drainage structure as approved by the
Commission. Where the discharge shall be into or through private property,
proper easements, or drainage rights, in form acceptable to the Town Counsel
shall be secured by the developer for the Town.
Permanent easements, at least twenty-five (25) feet in width, shall be provided in
all cases where storm drainage facilities are installed in land other than the street
right-of-way. The centerline of pipes shall be no closer than ten (10) feet and the
top of the slope for channels shall be no closer than five (5) feet to the boundaries
of the drainage easements. Easements shall also be provided for storm drainage
facilities that may need to be installed in the future to serve underdeveloped land
within the watershed that normally drains across the area of a proposed
development. All easements shall be clearly delineated and described on the
Record Subdivision Map required by the Town's Subdivision Regulations, to be
filed with the Town Clerk.
4.17.4 Other Requirements
a. In all instances, unless otherwise waived under Section 2.3.13, a Drainage
Analysis Map shall be submitted showing the tributary watershed area, subdrainage
basins, and the downstream area affected by runoff. Drainage
computations shall consider the entire area (on-site and off-site) of those
drainage basins contributing runoff to all design points.
b. Where a drainage facility is tributary to a portion of the Connecticut
Department of Transportation Drainage System, such drainage facility shall be
approved by the Commission and the Department of Transportation, and such
approval shall be submitted to the Commission prior to approval of the road
plan by the Commission.
Woodbury Connecticut Subdivision Regulations
Effective January 1, 2006 12:01 AM
44
c. In all roadway areas where a high groundwater table is found to exist or where
there is cutting required for road construction, the developer shall be required
to install underdrains as directed by the Town or its duly authorized agent, to
protect the stability of the roadway.
d. Suitable head wall or precast end sections shall be provided at the open end of
any pipe. Culverts under streets shall be extended to a minimum of ten (10)
feet from the edge of pavement.
e. Catch basins shall be provided so that no portion of any road shall drain in one
direction more than 300 feet without catch basins on both sides of the road.
f. The hydraulic capacity and the required size and slope of storm sewer pipes
and channels shall be established by using the Manning equation. The
hydraulic capacity of driveway and roadway cross culverts shall be established
only after considering both the inlet and outlet control conditions. The lower of
the two flow rates obtained shall be the actual rated capacity. The upstream
backwater shall not encroach onto adjacent properties unless backwater is
contained within existing watercourse or wetland limits, does not overtop
roadway or driveway areas, and the necessary drainage easements are secured
from those affected property owners.
g. House and foundation drains shall in no case be permitted to discharge onto the
highway surface. Such drains shall be connected to ground water recharge
systems wherever possible. Where not possible, discharge to existing
wetlands, watercourses, and storm drainage facilities shall be made. All such
drainage connections shall be made prior to construction of, or be made so as
not to cause damage to, the bituminous concrete wearing surface. Any damage
to roadway or its appurtenances will be the responsibility of the property
owner from whose property the drain is discharging.
h. All pipes and drainage structures shall be thoroughly cleaned before
acceptance.
i. Computations of peak rates of stormwater runoff shall be based on those
methods outlined in Chapter 9 of the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control, (dated January 1985), as amended. Existing
wetlands/watercourses proposed to receive storm drainage discharge shall be
analyzed to determine the downstream effects on any watercourse or existing
storm drainage system for its adequacy to receive the proposed drainage
discharge. The extent to which downstream studies are conducted shall be
commensurate with the probable impact of the proposed development. Where
it is anticipated that the additional discharge resulting from the proposed
subdivision will overload the existing downstream drainage system, the
Commission may deny the subdivision until the applicant has adequately
provided for improvements to the drainage system.

j. If the downstream system does not have the capacity to convey the additional
stormwater runoff, the use of stormwater detention basins is an acceptable and
desirable method of reducing peak rates of runoff to pre-development levels.
The design computations for such basins shall include inflow hydrographs,
stage storage and stage outflow curves, reservoir routing, and outflow
hydrographs. The detention basin shall be of a multi-stage type and shown to
control flows for the average return frequency of 2, 10 and 50-year storms of
24-hour duration. An emergency spillway designed to the average return
frequency 100-year storm shall also be provided. The applicant's engineer
shall use a guide in the design of the detention basin the Town's "Technical
Guideline for the Design of Detention Basins" set forth in Appendix B to these
subdivision regulations.

4.18 Watershed/Viewshed Regulated Area (Effective 4/1/98)
4.18.1 Intent: The Watershed/Viewshed Regulated Area is adopted in order to:
a. Promote the goals and objectives of the Woodbury Plan of Conservation and
Development.
b. Encourage the most appropriate use of land.
c. Preserve the natural environment of distinctive ridgeline areas as a visual and
historic asset for the benefit of the community.
d. Protect the groundwater recharging function and capacity of the ridges by
minimizing the potential for pollution and preserving open areas for
groundwater recharge.
e. Prevent the creation of any safety or health hazard including, but not limited to,
soil erosion, excessive drainage runoff, and degradation of water quality.
f. Minimize the adverse effect of development upon both the visual and
functional role of the natural landscape to preserve Woodbury's quality of life.
4.18.2 Applicability: For each subdivision application that includes subdivision
improvements or proposed house sites at or above elevation 400 feet, the
Commission shall evaluate the development of that portion of the subdivision
land located at or above this elevation and determine whether the applicant will be
required to provide watershed and viewshed information contained in this
Section. The factors in determining the applicability of this Section shall be the
effect that the proposed development has on the following: soil erosion by wind
or water, loss of vegetative cover, destabilization of slopes equal to or greater than
20% disruption of significant topographical features, and preservation of
significant scenic features, vistas, ridgelines, wildlife corridors, or significant
geological features. The Commission encourages all applicants to attend a
preliminary meeting, prior to filing an application, to determine the applicability
of this Section.
If the Commission determines that this Section is applicable, then it shall have the
authority to modify the plan in accordance with the provisions in this Section.
The applicant shall submit the following material or shall perform the following
analysis as deemed necessary by the Commission:
a. A map at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet showing the entire subdivision
and delineating that portion of the subdivision site above 400 feet in elevation
including all streambelt corridors and watershed divides.
Woodbury Connecticut Subdivision Regulations
Effective January 1, 2006 12:01 AM

b. An aerial photograph of the subdivision at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet
with the lot layout, house, driveway, septic, roadways, other improvements,
and the limits of clearing for the aforementioned items delineated, along with
an overlay indicating all areas on the site containing slopes of twenty (20)
percent or greater. Aerial photographs shall be either the latest Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection or Town Assessor's aerial or a more
recent independent aerial.
c. In consultation with the Commission, a list of visual impact observation points
for the proposed subdivision from regional highways, arterial, or collector
streets so designated in the Woodbury Plan of Development, public parks,
other areas accessible to the general public. These points shall be located
through field delineation and mapping. The applicant shall place aerial
markers, balloons, flags or other on-site markers at points corresponding to
the highest point of each proposed structure and/or the limits of site clearing
for any proposed subdivision improvements as deemed necessary by the
Commission to allow evaluation of the visual impacts as seen from various
observation points. For any subdivision improvement that requires
demarcation, no more than four (4) visual impact observation points shall be
required. The applicant shall provide photographs taken from visual impact
observation points of the subdivision with aerial markers in place or other onsite
markers. In addition to photographs, the Commission may request other
graphic illustration or other data sufficient to portray the visual impact of the
proposed activity.
d. A view vector plan showing location and dimensions of a sight cone(s) for
each lot and other subdivision improvements where removal of vegetation is
proposed. Site cone areas shall be designed to minimize visibility of the
subdivision improvements from the visual impact observation points and
reduce the potential for erosion. This plan shall specify the existing and
proposed basal rate of tree stock within the limits of disturbance shown for the
lot or subdivision improvement in question. Removal of tree stock within the
view sector cone shall be designed to minimize the visual impact and promote
the long-term stabilization of the development.
e. A site plan showing all significant vegetation such as large stands of trees,
individual trees twelve (12") inches in caliper or more, critical habitat areas,
and other sensitive areas such as historic or archeological features contained
in the Woodbury Cultural Resource/Open Space Plan or in the records of the
Connecticut Historic Commission, Office of the State Archaeologist, State
Historic Preservation Officer, or other similar documentation located on the
site plan and in cross-section at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet in
horizontal and one inch equals 125 feet in the vertical to allow analysis of
each lot. For each lot identified by the Commission, the applicant shall
provide the existing basal rate of tree stock, as calculated by a State of
Connecticut Registered Forester located between each proposed or existing

structures or other proposed subdivision improvements and the visual impact
observation points.
f. The Grading Plan required by Section 3.5 of these Regulations shall depict the
areas of twenty (20) percent slope or greater located on the property.
4.18.3 Mitigation Plan: A mitigation plan shall be submitted as a part of the application
that specifies mechanisms to minimize the visual and environmental impacts that
will result through the development of the subdivision as it relates to existing and
proposed structures and other subdivision improvements, public views, streambelt
and watershed protection including but not limited to the following:
a. Restrictions on the building materials incorporated into any structures
(including but not limited to roofing material), the portion of the structure
facing the observation points, building orientation, and the like;
b. Restriction on height and mass of structures and/or accessory structures
whenever the height is expected to exceed the height of the existing or
proposed vegetation screening the structures and improvements from the
visual impact observation points at a point in time five years from the time of
installation of any new plant material;
c. Restrictions on the location of any structures and/or accessory structures;
d. Restrictions on the clearing of vegetation on each individual lot and along
stream and wetland corridors;
e. Conservation easement areas along stream corridors and other significant site
features such as topographic, archeological, geologic and/or historic and the
like; and
f. To limit disturbance of slopes equal to twenty (20%) percent or greater
located on the property.
4.18.4 Criteria for Decision: In addition to the criteria of these Regulations, the
Commission shall evaluate every application under this Section in accordance
with the following criteria:
a. Visual Impact: The visual impact of the proposed activities as viewed from
regional highways, arterial, or collector streets so designated in the Woodbury
Plan of Conservation and Development, public parks, or other areas accessible
to the general public. Such impact may include, but not be limited to:
unnatural gaps, cuts, projections, or other artificial alterations of existing
natural tree lines, ridgelines, prominent topographic features, or rock
formations; the use of materials which, by their size and/or orientation disrupt

the natural or historic character of the ridgeline; the size, height, shape, and
location of buildings.
b. Environmental/Habitat Impact: The impact of the proposed activities on any
Federal or State rare or endangered species inhabiting, breeding, foraging, or
migrating through or over the area of the proposed activity and on any
indigenous wildlife of the site. The Commission shall consider the nature of
the area as a wildlife resource (habitat, breeding ground, foraging area,
migratory pathway, et cetera) and shall consider the impact of the proposed
activity on such resources(s).
c. Ground/Surface Water Impact: The groundwater recharge potential of the
area of the proposed activity, the aquifer being recharged, and analysis of the
possible impacts of the proposed activity on the groundwater recharge; the
impact on surface water flow and quality such as the nutrient load,
temperature, and turbidity of any surface waters.
d. Archeological and Historic Impact: The impact of the proposed activity on
any known or potential archeological resources and on the role which the site
may have played in any recorded chapter of American History as noted in the
Woodbury Plan of Conservation and Development, Woodbury Cultural
Resource/Open Space Plan (1997) or records of the Connecticut Commission,
Office of the State Archaeologist, State Historic Preservation Officer, or
similar organization.
4.18.5 Modifications, and Safeguards: If the Commission determines after the
evaluation of the information requested that the application is in substantial
compliance with this Section, the Commission in its sole discretion in order to
preserve the objectives of this Section may modify the plans or safeguards as
follows:
a. Site Development
1. Designate the location of structures and/or accessory structures on
proposed lots within the site cone area including the distance between
principal dwellings on adjoining lots;
2. Reduce the vegetative removal by restricting the size of lawn areas or
other land clearing in connection with development, require the use of
common driveways, require grading to be approximately parallel to
existing contours, require the use of retaining walls or other methods to
minimize disturbance of the existing topography and vegetation, and
reduce cutting and filing of slopes;
3. Restrict the size and location of septic systems; and
Woodbury Connecticut Subdivision Regulations
Effective January 1, 2006 12:01 AM
50
4. Require flagging of all vegetative removal on individual lots for approval
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to issuance of a Zoning Permit.
b. Viewshed Protection
1. Require that clear cutting occur in a staggered or other pattern which
reduces the visual impacts of the setting, and/or further require that clear
cutting be staged over a period of time to allow for regrowth of remaining
vegetation;
2. Require a specific reforestation and screening plan prepared by a State of

SECTION V - OPEN SPACE SUBDIVISIONS AND RESUBDIVISIONS
5.1 General:
The purpose of these open space subdivision regulations is to allow and encourage
the subdivision of land in a manner that protects and conserves the Town’s landscape and
scenic assets, natural resources, and environmental quality, as specified in the Open
Space Plan in the Town Plan of Conservation and Development. Subdivision designs
meeting the criteria of this Section may apply the conservation incentive design standards
in accordance with Woodbury Zoning Regulations Section 4.3.7, as an alternative to the
conventional layout of lots and other features. The specific objectives of this section are:
a. To preserve desirable open space, tree cover, historic sites, recreation areas,
scenic vistas, stream valleys, wetlands and water related resources, roadside
trees and stonewalls, and other environmentally important lands, soils and geologic
phenomena;
b. To preserve the character of existing residential properties while not negatively
affecting property values of existing residential development in the area; and
c. To provide for the efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets and thereby lowering housing and public maintenance costs; and
d. To preserve the greatest extent possible contiguous areas of agricultural or
forest lands, while maintaining the existing use as productive farm and forest
land and/or wildlife habitat.
e. To preserve specific views, vistas, and visual focal points.
f. To provide for circulation patterns that are compatible with variation of building
setbacks and clustering of homes
5.2 Applicability:
An application for an open space subdivision or resubdivision requires the granting of a
Special Exception, as authorized by the Woodbury Zoning Regulations 4.3.7,
together with subdivision approval pursuant to these Subdivision Regulations.
Application for an open space subdivision shall be submitted to the Commission in
accordance with the procedures established in Section 2 of these Regulations and shall
demonstrate conformance with the open space subdivision standards in Woodbury
Zoning Regulations Section 4.3.7 and the following additional requirements.
5.2.1 Parcel Size: The parcel proposed to be subdivided must contain a minimum of
ten (10) acres. An open space subdivision or resubdivision may contain both

standard and open space lots.
5.2.2 Open Space: The areas set aside or reserved for open space conservation and/or
recreation must meet with the standards and specifications under Section 5.4
herein and shall be conveyed by one or more of the methods set forth in Section
4.9.5 of these Regulations.
5.2.3 Maximum Numbers of Lots: In no event will the total number of lots exceed the
maximum number that would be allowed for a standard subdivision based on the
following maximum lot yield calculation. The maximum number of building lots
permitted in an open space subdivision or resubdivision shall be determined by a
State of Connecticut Registered Land Surveyor or Engineer in the following
manner:
5.2.3.1 Calculating the net area of the parcel by subtracting from the total parcel
area 100% of those areas classified as wetlands, flood zone A, or floodway
per FEMA maps, or areas having slope in excess of 25%. The area of
inland wetlands shall be determined by certified soil scientist and flagged.
The flood plain district shall be determined by field elevations relative to
mean sea level, (U.S.G.S. datum) and by reference to the Flood Insurance
Rate Map for the Town of Woodbury, Community Panel Numbers 090133
0001-0002. Areas having slopes in excess of twenty-five (25) percent
shall be determined either by a field survey or by two (2) foot interval
contour maps prepared by an aerial photogrammetry firm. Small areas of
exposed ledge, boulders, or abrupt changes in grade which are less than
fifty (50) square feet in size shall not be included in the areas having
slopes greater than twenty-five (25) percent.
5.2.3.2 Reducing the net area of the parcel by 10% to allow for road(s) and right
of way, or any other land dedicated for public highway purposes to arrive
at the net buildable area.
5.2.3.3 Dividing the net buildable area by the minimum area requirements for a
standard lot for the zoning district in which the property is located as set
forth in the Woodbury Zoning Regulations, the resulting quotient of said
division shall be the maximum number of lots permitted in open space
subdivisions or resubdivisions subject to the open space provision of
Section 5.4.1.2 herein.
5.2.3.4 Open space lots shall meet the height, square, area, and yard requirements
of Section 4.3.7 of the Woodbury Zoning Regulations.
5.3 Maps and Plans: The applicant shall file plans in accordance with Section 2 of these
Regulations. Such plans shall include drawings, sketches, and other pertinent
information that illustrates the character, locations, and accessibility of the proposed open
space and its conformance to the open space criteria of Section 4.9.2 of these
Regulations. The applicant shall utilize a registered architect, landscape architect, or land
planner to prepare plans in conjunction with the licensed surveyor and/or engineer for all
open space subdivisions or resubdivisions.

unless otherwise provided herein, for other public improvements
(including, but not limited to, storm drainage areas) shall be designated as
open space.
5.4.2.2 As provided by Section 4.3.7 of the Woodbury Zoning Regulations, at
least 50% of the parcel to be subdivided shall be protected as open space
meeting the standards of Section 4.3.7 of the Woodbury Zoning
Regulations. Land preserved to meet the requirements of this section may
include wetlands (as determined by a certified soil scientist) flood plain,
and steep slopes (in excess of twenty-five (25) percent) provided that the
percentage of land in these categories shall not exceed the percentage of
land in these categories for the entire tract proposed for subdivision. No
restrictions apply to land preserved as open space in excess of the
minimum required.
5.4.3 Storm Drainage Area as Open Space: The Commission may allow storm drainage
facilities in the open space areas provided the Site Development Plan adequately
preserves the natural assets of said area, including its vegetation.
5.4.4 Ownership of Open Space: Ownership of open space shall be in accordance with
Section 4.9.5 of these Subdivision Regulations.
5.4.5 Streets: All streets constructed as part of an Open Space Subdivision shall meet

2.15.7 The Board of Selectmen or its agent shall have two (2) working days in which to inspect
the completed work in each of the above stages of the project prior to approving the
work. No work shall be commenced on succeeding stages of construction until the
required inspection has been made and approval given in writing by the Board of
Selectmen. The Board of Selectmen may issue a Stop Work Order and may suspend the
Street Construction Permit if in its judgment the construction project or any stage thereof
is not being carried out in accordance with these Regulations or if unforeseen field
circumstances are encountered for which the approved plans are insufficient; the Board
shall withdraw such Order and reinstate the Permit when it determines that there is
compliance with these Regulations.

2.16 Barricades and Protection: When any excavation is made within the right-of-way of
any Town Street, the applicant or his contractor shall provide a railing or suitable
barricade so as to enclose such excavation material placed in the right-of-way. The
railing or barricade shall be continued and maintained during the whole time such
excavation is exposed or open. A sufficient number of lighted flashing warning lights
approved by the Board of Selectmen shall be provided for public safety, to be affixed to
some part of such railing or barricade or in such other proper manner over or near such
excavation and excavated material, and so kept from the beginning of the twilight of the
evening through the whole of the night, and every evening and night during the time such
excavation shall be open, exposed or in state of repair. The applicant or his contractor
shall comply with any order of the Board of Selectmen or their authorized agent for
provision of barricades and shall furnish a Town constable or a State Trooper in uniform
when so ordered.
2.17 Rights of Safe Passage: The applicant or his contractor shall provide safe and
convenient passage for public travel around or over any excavation in a Town street or
highway and shall keep such passage free from earth, stones, trenches or any other
material which may hinder travel of pedestrians or vehicles. The applicant or his
contractor shall comply with any order of the Board of Selectmen or their authorized
agent for protection of safe passage. Street gutters shall not be obstructed in any manner
so as to prevent or retard flow of water therein.

not duplicate or too closely approximate in spelling or sound existing street names in the
Town of Woodbury. All street names shall be subject to the approval of the Planning
Commission and the Board of Selectmen. Street name signs conforming to Town
standards shall be erected by the applicant at all street intersections at locations
designated by the Board of Selectmen or its designee after the binder asphalt surface has
been applied.
3.4 Street Construction
Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the following standards and procedures:
3.4.1 Survey and Field Layout: Instrument surveys shall be made, maintained and
recorded as follows:
a. A centerline survey of the street shall be run in the field and suitable
construction ties established to all control points. Stations shall be
established to all control points. Stations shall be established at 50-foot
intervals and at all points of curvature and points of tangency. The
beginning of this line shall be designated at Station 0+00 and shall be the
intersection point of the proposed centerline with the centerline of the
connecting street. Offset hubs shall be provided as part of the centerline
survey.
b. A construction stake shall be placed perpendicular to the tangent or radial
in the case of curves, at each station on both sides of the street and clear of
all construction. The construction stake shall be marked with the station,
offset to centerline and cut or fill to profile grade as measured from the top
of the stake.
A-11
c. A stake sheet showing the stations, profile grade, stake offsets and grades,
and cuts or fills shall be prepared and presented to the Board of Selectmen
before construction starts.
d. Permanent benchmarks shall be established throughout the duration of the
project and recorded with the Board of Selectmen throughout the length of
the project at 1,000 foot intervals or as directed by the Board. The datum
for benchmarks shall be appropriate Town or State datum or U.S. National
Geodetic Vertical Datum; assumed datum may be used only with the
permission in writing from the Board.
e. Grades stakes shall be protected and preserved until the construction work
is approved by the Board of Selectmen.
3.4.2 Clearing and Grubbing: The area of the right-of-way required to be graded shall
be limited to the shoulder widths specified in Table 1 of Section 3.4.1 of these
Street Regulations in accordance with the standard cross section contained in
these Regulations. This area shall be cleared of trees, stumps, brush, roots, large
rocks, ledge and other unsuitable materials, except that trees suitable for street
trees shall be left standing as directed by the Board of Selectmen.
3.4.3 Preparation of Subgrade: The subgrade will be prepared as follows:
a. All trees and roots shall be stripped to below the basecourse of the
pavement and for the full width of the pavement. All soft spots, peat,
loam, organic material, spongy material, boulders, ledge and other
unsuitable materials shall be removed and replaced by material
conforming to Form 814A, Section M.02.07. Where ledge rock is
encountered, it shall be removed to a depth of 18 inches below subgrade,
and the area backfilled with gravel.
b. Embankments shall be constructed of suitable fill material deposited in
successive layers not exceeding 12 inches in depth after compaction;
embankments to an elevation of three (3) feet above free water surface at
the time of filling shall be constructed of rock and/or free draining
material conforming to Form 814A, Section M.02.07. No stone over five
(5) inches in its greatest dimension shall be placed within 18 inches of the
elevation of the subgrade.
c. The subgrade shall be compacted by the use of power rollers of at least 16
tons, or by other means approved by the Board or its agent. The subgrade
shall be brought to a uniform surface to conform to the shape of the
required cross section.
d. Where rock fill is used, fill shall be installed in lifts no greater than three
(3) feet to the desired depth.
A-12
e. The Board of Selectmen may require the installation of drainage beneath
the street pavement or in the right-of-way where necessary to protect the
stability of the pavement.
3.4.4 Base Course: The base course shall be constructed as follows: On the prepared
and approved subgrade, a three-course, rolled gravel base shall be constructed
having a depth of 18 inches after compaction. The gravel material and
construction methods shall conform to Form 814A, section M.02.02 and 3.02.
3.4.5 Surface Course: On the prepared and approved base course, free of frozen
materials, there shall be constructed a two-course surface of bituminous concrete,
each course 2 inches in depth after compaction. Construction methods and
material shall conform to Form 814A, Section M.04.01 and Section 4.06.
Bituminous Concrete Paving Mixture Binder Course. The surface course shall be
installed when the temperature is 40 degrees and rising unless written permission
is obtained from the Board of Selectmen and unless a period of at least 60 days
has elapsed with the drainage subgrade and base course in place where deemed
necessary.
3.4.6 Curbs: Where necessary, bituminous concrete curbs shall be constructed on the
outer edge of the completed pavement. Curbs shall be machine formed, having a
cross section approved by the Board of Selectmen, a height of six (6) inches and a
base width of nine (9) inches. The curb material method of construction shall
conform to Form 814A, Section M.04.01 and Section 8.15. Where driveways
exist or are planned, depressed curbing must be installed.
3.4.7 Slopes: Cut slopes beyond the edge of the required shoulder or sidewalk shall not
exceed one (1) foot rise for each two (2) feet of horizontal distance. Fill slopes
beyond the edge of said shoulder or sidewalk shall not exceed one (1) foot of fall
for each three (3) feet of horizontal distance. The Board of Selectmen may
require a variation in the degree of slope to whatever extent is necessary to
maintain the stability of the bank under the particular conditions. The Board may
require the submission of a detailed erosion control plan and the institution of
stabilization procedures contained in the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control, (dated January 1985), as amended. Such procedure may
include without limitation the installation of hay bale check dams, hay, straw, or
wood fiber mulch, jute or fabric netting, crushed stone, and diversion swales. All
earth surfaces of slopes, and areas that have been disturbed in any way due to
grading and construction of streets, shall be covered with a minimum of four (4)
inches of topsoil and suitably seeded or planted to prevent soil erosion. The
Board of Selectmen may require the removal or lowering of embankments
adjacent to street intersections in order to assure adequate sight distance at the
intersection. No cut or fill sections beyond the right of way shall extend into
property outside the subdivision or property not owned by the applicant, unless
appropriate slope rights are obtained for the Town; in the absence of such slope
rights, appropriate private retaining walls not to exceed a height of five (5) feet
A-13
shall be constructed within the subdivision to prevent encroachment upon
subdivision lots or adjoining property. Such retaining walls shall be designed
according to acceptable engineering practices and shall be of rubble masonry type
unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission.
3.4.8 Guide Posts: Guideposts shall be installed along all streets where there will be an
embankment with a depth of five (5) feet or more. Posts shall conform to Form
814A, Section M.10 and shall be installed in accordance with Form 814A,
Sections 9.10, 9.11, and 9.12.
3.4.9 Site Clean-up: All large rocks and boulders shall be removed from the cleared
area of the street right-of-way and shall be deposited and suitably covered at an
approved location on the property. Felled trees, stumps, and brush shall be
removed from the project site or chipped and deposited in accordance with site
plans approved by the Woodbury Planning Commission and the Woodbury Inland
Wetlands and Watercourses Agency.
3.4.10 Storm Drainage Design: Storm drainage for streets shall be planned and designed
in accordance with the following standards:
3.4.10.1 General. Sufficient pipe shall be installed to carry existing water
courses in the street right-of-way and to drain both the proposed street
or streets and extensions thereof or other streets which, based on
topography, will be served by the same drainage system. No open
ditches or channels shall be provided in the street right-of-way unless:
a) sufficient additional right-of-way, in excess of the minimum standard
width, is provided so as to maintain the standard cross section and b)
proper provision is made for protective guide posts or rails. Street
drainage systems shall take into account the effects upon downstream
systems, shall be coordinated with general drainage requirements for
the use and development of the abutting land and shall provide for the
following:
a. Use and protection, and improvement if needed, of the natural
drainage system;
b. Interception of channel drainage coming from any adjoining
property or street;
c. Protection of locations in use or proposed necessary for on-site
sewage disposal and water supply facilities; and
d. Prevention of flooding and soil erosion.
A-14
3.4.10.2 Runoff Calculations. Peak rates of stormwater runoff shall be computed
using those methods outlined in Chapter 9 of the Connecticut Guideline
for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, dated January 1985, as
amended. All storm drainage facilities shall be designed with sufficient
capacity to convey the peak rates of runoff from storms with the
average return frequencies listed below:
? 10 Year - All enclosed drainage facilities within road and
easement from catch basins to outlets, etc.
? 25 Year - All cross culverts under roadways and drives, for
improved streams, swales and ditches.
? 50 Year - All cross culverts and bridges constructed under major
arteries, and where required by the Town Engineer.
3.4.10.3 Friction Factors. The hydraulic capacity and the required size and slope
of storm sewer pipes and channels shall be established by using the
Manning Equation. The friction coefficient for pipes shall be as
recommended by the pipe manufacturer, but in no case shall it be lower
than the values recommended by A.S.C.E. Manual of Practice No. 37,
Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers, 1969, as
amended.
3.4.10.4 Discharge. The discharge of all storm water that has been collected or
otherwise artificially channeled shall be into suitable natural streams or
into Town or State drainage systems (design discharge points) with
adequate capacity to carry the discharge. The peak run-off rate for a
twenty-five (25) year storm at all designed discharge points shall not
exceed natural run-off in a twenty-five year storm, calculated in
accordance with Section 2.3.13 of the Subdivision Regulations, unless
specifically approved in advance by the Woodbury Inland Wetlands
Agency and the Woodbury Public Works Department. Otherwise there
shall be no discharge onto or over private property within or adjoining
the street unless a) proper easements and discharge rights have been
secured by the applicant, b) such easements and rights are transferable
to the Town and c) there will be adequate safeguards against soil
erosion and flood danger. No storm water shall be diverted from one
watershed to another. Discharge shall be made in a manner that
protects streams, ponds and swamps from pollution.
A-15
3.4.11 Drainage Construction: Storm drainage shall be constructed in accordance with
the following standards:
3.4.11.1 Pipe: All storm drainage pipe shall be either Class 4 reinforced concrete
pipe (RCP), asphalt coated corrugated metal pipe (ACCMP),
corrugated aluminum pipe, high density polyethylene pipe with smooth
interior, or PVC pipe and shall conform to the requirements of Form
814A, Section 6.51. The minimum cover over all storm drainage
within the right-of-way lines shall be two (2) feet. Where water is
encountered in the pipe trenches, or where the Selectmen shall direct,
storm drains shall be either slotted RCP, perforated ACCMP, perforated
aluminum pipe or perforated PVC pipe and shall conform to the
requirements of Form 814A, Section 7.51. In general, underdrain shall
be installed on the uphill side of the road.
3.4.11.2 Methods: Storm drainage pipe shall be laid in accordance with the
following procedures:
a. Prior to laying pipe, the trench shall be excavated to the required
depth, the bottom of which shall be graded to afford a uniformly
firm bearing for the pipe throughout its length. Where rock is
encountered, it shall be excavated to not less than six inches (6")
below the bottom of the trench and this depth shall be refilled
with crushed stone and thoroughly tamped and shaped. Where the
nature of the foundation material is poor, it shall be removed and
backfilled with gravel or crushed stone approved by the Board of
Selectmen, or its agent.
b. All pipe shall be carefully laid, true to the lines and grades given,
hubs upgrade and with the ends fully entered into adjacent hubs.
c. Line and grade stakes shall be set by a Connecticut licensed land
surveyor or professional engineer and shall be maintained in good
order until the work has been inspected and approved by the Board
of Selectmen. Where necessary, three (3) batter boards shall be
maintained in place at all times when laying pipe and shall not be
spaced more than 30 feet apart.
d. In sandy, silty or other soil in which there is a danger of washing
or cave-ins, the joints of concrete pipe shall be thoroughly wetted
and caulked.
e. All metal pipe shall be carefully joined and firmly clamped
together by approved connecting bands which shall be properly
bolted in place before any backfill is placed.
A-16
f. The backfill around the pipe and to a depth of at least eight (8)
inches on top of pipe shall consist of crushed stone; where the
drainage pipe is necessary to serve as an underdrain for the street
or to control the water table, the remainder of the trench may be
backfilled with bank run gravel upon approval of the Board of
Selectmen.
g. Inlet conditions at all culverts shall be confined to a maximum
headwater depth of 1.2 times the diameter of the culvert.
h. "Riprap" conforming to the requirements of Form 814A, Section
7.03 and M.12.02, shall be placed at inlets, outlets, in channel beds
at bends or curves as required to prevent scouring, erosion and/or
siltation of streams and culverts.
i. The inlets and outlets of all exposed drainage culverts shall be
protected by concrete or mortared stone headwalls, endwalls and,
where necessary, appurtenant wingwalls. All endwalls shall
conform to the requirements of Form 814A, Section 5.06.
j. Catch basins, manholes, drop inlets, endwalls and other related
drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with Form
814A, Section 5.07.
k. No portion of any road shall drain in one direction more than 300
feet without catch basins on both sides of the road. In cases of
extremely steep or flat grades and excessively large drainage areas,
the Board may require installation of catch basins at lesser
intervals. Catch basins shall also be located so as to eliminate, as
much as practical, storm water flow across intersections.
3.4.11.3 Alternative Drainage Design. The Board may approve alternative
drainage design, such as swales and infiltrators, based on appropriate
engineering and approved by the Woodbury Planning Commission
pursuant to the Woodbury Subdivision Regulations.
3.5 Sidewalks
Where sidewalks are to be installed, as determined by the Board of Selectmen and the
Planning Commission, they shall be constructed of portland cement concrete or
bituminous concrete as follows:
3.5.1 Width and Location. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width and
shall be located two (2) feet from the curb to provide for a grass area.
A-17
3.5.2 Bituminous Sidewalks. Bituminous concrete sidewalks shall be laid on an eight
(8) inch gravel base, tamped and rolled, and three (3) inches thick after
compaction. The bituminous materials used shall conform to Form 814A, Section
M.04. - Class 2 and the construction shall conform to Section 9.22.
3.5.3 Concrete Sidewalks. Portland cement concrete sidewalks shall be laid on a six (6)
inch bank run gravel base, tamped and rolled and shall be constructed of concrete
five (5) inches in thickness. Material shall conform to Form 814A, Section
M.03.01 for Class "C" concrete and shall be constructed in accordance with Form
814A, Section 9.21.
3.6 Miscellaneous
3.6.1 Monuments. Monuments shall be provided on both street right-of-way lines at the
beginning and termination of each street and at each deflection or tangent point in
between. Monuments shall be made of granite or prestressed concrete and shall
be set in place, after all street construction is completed, with the market point set
on the point of reference in accordance with the Connecticut Council, Inc.
3.6.2 Underground Utilities. Electric and telephone lines and facilities in new streets
shall be installed underground unless the Planning Commission has determined
that such underground installation is in whole or in part inappropriate or
unfeasible. Wherever possible, such lines and facilities shall not be located under
the street pavement. The lines and facilities shall be installed after the street
right-of-way has been graded but prior to installation of the base course for the
street pavement.
3.6.3 Private Property Notice. At the commencement of construction of a new road on
private property, the property owner shall erect and maintain in good condition
until acceptance of the road by the Town of Woodbury, a sign indicating that the
road is private property, not open to public travel, and being constructed in
accordance with the Woodbury Street Regulations. Said sign will be furnished by
the Town of Woodbury. The property owner will be responsible for any
damages that may occur to said sign.
3.6.4 Street Lights. When required by the Board of Selectmen and/or the Planning
Commission, the developer shall install streetlights at all intersections, including
intersections of a new street with existing streets. Streetlights shall be in operation
prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the development. The
developer shall be responsible for all operating and maintenance costs for such
streetlights until the streets are accepted by the Town. Street lighting installed
shall be in accordance with the standards established by the Town or
recommended standards for municipal street lighting as established by the utility
company providing local service.
Subdivision Regulations
Appendix B
TECHNICAL GUIDELINES
FOR THE DESIGN OF DETENTION BASINS
B-1
TECHNICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF DETENTION BASINS
Design Guidelines
If detention basins are necessary as part of a stormwater management plan, they must be
designed in accordance with currently accepted engineering design practices. Included in the
design submission must be the following:
1. Map showing site, its location within the watershed, and the watershed limits. All
detention facilities serving a watershed larger than (10) acres in size shall be analyzed
with hydrograph and storage routing techniques.
2. Examination of the routing of stormwater through the site and its flow pat as it is
discharged from the site. Sub-drainage basin limits within the watershed must be
delineated.
3. Determination of the full flow capacity of downstream watercourses or storm drainage
structures. The lowest capacity values found will determine the maximum flow rates at
which stormwater may be released from the site, unless there is sufficient wetland area
available downstream to detain and gradually release excess stormwater flows.
4. Designation of the location(s) of the proposed detention basin(s). Provide hydrographs
for the stormwater runoff from those areas tributary to the proposed detention facility.
Existing and proposed conditions must be evaluated. Hydrographs for storms with
average return frequencies 2, 10 and 50 year, 24 hour type III storms should be
computed. Selection of the appropriate method for developing these hydrographs should
be based upon the size of the contributing drainage areas and the design output
requirements. Chapter 9 of the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control (dated January 1985, as amended) should be used as a guide.
5. Design the detention basin based on results of the above steps. Touting analyses should
be completed for the hydrographs generated in subsection 4, above. Special attention
should be given to providing an emergency spillway to pass excess flows from the 100
year storm. Chapter 8 of the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control (dated January 1985, as amended) should be used as a guide in the design.
6. The detention basin may be designed to drain dry or retain water for extended periods
after rain events. Dry basins are recommended over wet basins (retention type).
7. The depth-area-volume relationship of the basin is dependent on the storage volume
needed to reduce the peak inflow rate to some desired peak outflow rate. As the natural
contours in the site dictate, ponding depths should be kept as shallow as possible.
However, where stormwater storage depths exceed four (4) feet, a bench width of six (6)
feet should be provided around the entire perimeter of the basin (exclusive of bermed
areas) at every four (4) vertical feet of storage depth.
B-2
8. Outlets from normally dry detention basins can take on a number of forms, limited only
by safety and maintenance considerations. Outlet pipe must be at least 12 inches in
diameter to facilitate maintenance. If less capacity is required than a 12 inch pipe would
provide, flow should be throttled at the pipe entrance. Trash racks or perforated rises are
required at inlets to help guard against plugging of the pipe.
9. The side slope of the basin should be no steeper than four horizontal to one vertical, (4:1)
for the safety of mechanical mowing equipment and the safety of people during those
times when water is being stored. All grades on the bottom of this basin should be at
least two percent so that the bottom will drain quickly and leave no wet spots.
10. An emergency spillway outlet should be provided for discharge of inflows in the event
the storage capacity is exceeded or the drainage system plugged. It must be designed for
the 100 year storm frequency event.
11. Easements should be included if necessary and access roads provided to allow vehicles
and other equipment the access needed for maintenance of the basin.
12. If detention is to be of the wet basin, (retention type), the volume needed for temporary
storage must be provided above the normal pond elevation. A 10 foot width of maximum
two percent slope should surround the pond just above the normal pond elevation to
provide a safe landing place for those who may slip down the slope adjacent to the pond.
13. The outlet structure of wet basins (retention type) must be constructed such that the pond
level is maintained. The side slopes beneath the water surface of the pond should be two

Section 1: Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are
an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with
which the citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands
and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an
adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological
stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and
purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of
animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and
watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction
because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or
removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the
erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled,
polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such
unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant,
adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of
Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the
environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic
and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now
and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands
and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and
unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest
and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the
state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these Regulations to protect the
citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection,
preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and
watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution;
maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the
highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing
damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and
other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the
destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting
the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands
and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic,
recreational and other public and private uses and values; and
protecting the state’s potable fresh water supplies from the dangers
of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by
providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic
growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its
environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people
of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and
enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet
unborn.
1.2 These Regulations shall be known as the “Inland Wetlands and
Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Woodbury.”

enforce the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue,
issue with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny
permits for all regulated activities in the Town of Woodbury pursuant
to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes (“CGS”), as amended.
Section 2: Definitions
Words used in these Regulations shall be determined to have the meanings
as defined in Appendix A. Doubt as to the precise meaning of other words
and terms shall be determined by the Commission after reference to:
? The Connecticut General Statutes,
? Black’s Law Dictionary,
? The Illustrated Book of Development Definitions, and,
? Webster’s Third New International Dictionary.
Section 3: Inventory of Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
3.1 The map of wetlands and watercourses entitled “Inland Wetlands and
Watercourses Map,” Woodbury Connecticut” delineates the general
location and boundaries of inland wetlands and the general location of
watercourses. Copies of this map are available for inspection at the
Town Land Use Office. In all cases the precise location of regulated
areas shall be determined by the actual character of the land, the
distribution of wetland soil types, and locations of watercourses. Such
determinations shall be made by field inspection and testing
conducted by a soil scientist where soil determinations are required,
or where watercourse determinations are required, by any qualified
individual. The Agency may amend its map from time to time as
information, including aerial photography, remote sensing imagery,
resource mapping, soils maps, site inspection observations, or other
information, becomes available relative to more accurate delineation
of wetlands and watercourses within the Town.

and future activities associated with or reasonably related to the
proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the
proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on
wetlands and watercourses.
10.3 In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant
to a finding by the Agency that the proposed activity may have a
significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be
issued unless the Agency finds on the basis of the record that a
feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding
the Agency shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in
subsection 10.2 of this section. The finding and the reasons therefore
shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding
that there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed
regulated activity which have less adverse impact on wetlands or
watercourses, the Agency shall propose on the record in writing the
types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this
subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the
applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present
alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) “wetlands and watercourses”
includes aquatic plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or
watercourses, and (2) “habitats” means areas or environments in

10.6 A municipal inland wetlands agency shall not deny or condition an
application for a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or
watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or
animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical
characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the
Agency shall base its decision on the record of that hearing.
Documentary evidence or other material not in the application file or
hearing record shall not be considered by the Agency in its decision.

APPENDIX E: DEP Guidelines for Upland Review Area Regulations
Follows
Accepted Aquifer Protection Area Regulations
Town of Woodbury, Connecticut
SECTION 1. Title and Authority
(a) Aquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water for the State
of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and opportunities for
new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and increasingly intense
development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have been contaminated by
certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. To address this problem, Connecticut
has established the Aquifer Protection Area Program (Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to
§22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply aquifers and to protect them from pollution by
managing land use. Protection requires coordinated responsibilities shared by the state,
municipality and water companies to ensure a plentiful supply of public drinking water for present
and future generations. It is therefore the purpose of these regulations to protect aquifer
protection areas within the Town of Woodbury, making provisions for:
(1) implementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An Act Concerning Aquifer
Protection Areas, Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb (“the Act”);
(2) delineating aquifer protection areas on the city/town zoning or inland wetland and
watercourse areas maps;
(3) regulating land use activity within the aquifer protection area including: prohibiting certain
new activities; registering existing regulated activities; and issuing permits for new regulated
activities at registered facilities; and
(4) administering and enforcing these regulations.
(b) These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Area Regulations (the "APA
Regulations") of the Town of Woodbury.
(c) These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with the
provisions of §22a-354p of An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, the Connecticut General
Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies §22a-354i-1
through §22a-354i-10.
(d) The Zoning Commission of the Town of Woodbury is established as the Aquifer Protection Agency
(the "Agency") in accordance with the "Ordinance for the Establishment of an Aquifer Protection
Agency," (the "APA Ordinance") , and shall implement the purposes and provisions of the APA
Ordinance and the Act.
(e) The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall approve or deny registrations, issue
permits, issue permits with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all
regulated activities in aquifer protection areas in the Town of Woodbury pursuant to the Act.
